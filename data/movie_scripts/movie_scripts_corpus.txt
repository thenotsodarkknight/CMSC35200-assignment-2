					April 8, 1996







	FADE IN ON:

	COMPUTER SCREEN

	So close it has no boundaries.

	A blinking cursor pulses in the electric darkness like a
	heart coursing with phosphorous light, burning beneath
	the derma of black-neon glass.

	A PHONE begins to RING, we hear it as though we were 
	making the call.  The cursor continues to throb,
	relentlessly patient, until --

					MAN (V.O.)
			Hello?

	Data now slashes across the screen, information flashing
	faster than we read.

					SCREEN
			Call trans opt:  received.
			2-19-96  13:24:18  REC:Log>

					WOMAN (V.O.)
			I'm inside.  Anything to report?

	We listen to the phone conversation as though we were on
	a third line.  The man's name is CYPHER.  The woman, 
	TRINITY.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Let's see.  Target left work at
			5:01 PM.

					SCREEN
			Trace program:  running.

	The entire screen fills with racing columns of numbers.
	Shimmering like green-electric rivets, they rush at a 10-
	digit phone number in the top corner.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			He caught the northbound Howard 
			line. Got off at Sheridan.  
			Stopped at 7-11.  Purchased six-
			pack of beer and a box of Captain 
			Crunch.  Returned home.

	The area code is identified.  The first three numbers
	suddenly fixed, leaving only seven flowing columns.

	We begin MOVING TOWARD the screen, CLOSING IN as each 
	digit is matched, one by one, snapping into place like
	the wheels of a slot machine.

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			All right, you're relieved.  Use
			the usual exit.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Do you know when we're going to
			make contact?

					TRINITY
			Soon.

	Only two thin digits left.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Just between you and me, you don't 
			believe it, do you?  You don't 
			believe this guy is the one?

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			I think Morpheus believes he is.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			I know.  But what about you?

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			I think Morpheus knows things that
			I don't.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Yeah, but if he's wrong --

	The final number pops into place --

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			Did you hear that?

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Hear what?

					SCREEN
			Trace complete.  Call origin:
			#312-555-0690

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			Are you sure this line is clean?

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Yeah, course I'm sure.

	We MOVE STILL CLOSER, the ELECTRIC HUM of the green 
	numbers GROWING INTO an OMINOUS ROAR.

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			I better go.

					CYPHER (V.O.) 
			Yeah.  Right.  See you on the other side.

	She hangs up as we PASS THROUGH the numbers, entering the
	netherworld of the computer screen.

	Where gradually the sound of a police radio grows around 
	us.

					RADIO (V.O.)
			Attention all units.  Attention
			all units.

	Suddenly, a flashlight cuts open the darkness and we find
	ourselves in --


	INT.  CHASE HOTEL - NIGHT

	The hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way 
	across the polyester carpeting, destroying several rooms 
	as it spooled soot up the walls and ceiling leaving 
	patterns of permanent shadow.

	We FOLLOW four armed POLICE officers using flashlights as 
	they creep down the blackened hall and ready themselves
	on either side of room 303.

	The biggest of them violently kicks in the door --

	The other cops pour in behind him, guns thrust before
	them.

					BIG COP
			Police!  Freeze!

	The room is almost devoid of furniture.  There is a fold-
	up table and chair with a phone, a modern, and a powerbook 
	computer.  The only light in the room is the glow of the
	computer.

	Sitting there, her hands still on the keyboard, is 
	TRINITY; a woman in black leather.

					BIG COP
			Get your hands behind your head!

	Trinity rises.

					BIG COP
			Hands behind your head!  Now!  Do
			it!

	She slowly puts her hands behind her head.


	EXT.  CHASE HOTEL - NIGHT

	A black sedan with tinted windows glides in through the 
	police cruisers.

	AGENT SMITH and AGENT BROWN get out of the car.

	They wear dark suits and sunglasses even at night.  They 
	are also always hardwired; small Secret Service earphones 
	in one ear, its cord coiling back into their shirt
	collars.

					AGENT SMITH
			Lieutenant?

					LIEUTENANT
			Oh shit.

					AGENT SMITH 
			Lieutenant, you were given 
			specific orders --

					LIEUTENANT
			I'm just doing my job.  You gimme 
			that Juris-my dick-tion and you 
			can cran it up your ass.

					AGENT SMITH
			The orders were for your protection.

	The Lieutenant laughs.

					LIEUTENANT
			I think we can handle one little
			girl.

	Agent Smith nods to Agent Brown as they start toward the
	hotel.

					LIEUTENANT
			I sent two units.  They're 
			bringing her down now.

					AGENT SMITH
			No, Lieutenant, your men are dead.


	INT.  CHASE HOTEL

	The Big Cop flicks out his cuffs, the other cops holding 
	a bead.  They've done this a hundred times, they know 
	they've got her, until the Big Cop reaches with the cuff 
	and Trinity moves --

	It almost doesn't register, so smooth and fast, inhumanly 
	fast.

	The eye blinks and Trinity's palm. snaps up and the nose 
	explodes, blood erupting.  The cop is dead before he
	begins to fall.

	And Trinity is moving again --

	Seizing a wrist, misdirecting a gun, as a startled cop 
	FIRES --

	A head explodes.

	In blind panic, another airs his gun, the barrel, a fixed 
	black hole --

	And FIRES --

	Trinity twists out of the way, the bullet missing as she 
	reverses into a roundhouse kick, knocking the gun away.

	The cop begins to scream when a jump kick crushes his 
	windpipe, killing the scream as he falls to the ground.

	She looks at the four bodies.

					TRINITY
			Shit.


	EXT.  CHASE HOTEL

	Agent Brown enters the hotel, while Agent Smith heads for 
	the alley.


	INT.  CHASE HOTEL

	Trinity is on the phone, pacing.  The other end is 
	answered.

					MAN (V.O.)
			Operator.

					TRINITY
			Morpheus!  The link was traced!  I
			don't know how.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I know.  Stay calm.

					TRINITY
			Are there any agents?

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Yes.

					TRINITY
			Goddamnit!

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			You have to focus.  There is a 
			phone.  Wells and Laxe.  You can
			make it.

	She takes a deep breath, centering herself.

					TRINITY
			All right --

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Go.

	She drops the phone.


	INT.  HALL

	She bursts out of the room as Agent Brown enters the hall,
	leading another unit of police.  Trinity races to the 
	opposite end, exiting through a broken window onto the 
	fire escape.


	EXT.  FIRE E5CAPE

	In the alley below, Trinity sees Agent Smith staring at 
	her.  She can only go up.


	EXT.  ROOF

	On the roof, Trinity is running as Agent Brown rises over 
	the parapet, leading the cops in pursuit.

	Trinity begins to jump from one roof to the next, her 
	moverents so clean, gliding in and out of each jump,
	contrasted to the wild jumps of the cops.

	Agent Brown, however, has the same unnatural grace.

	The METAL SCREAM of an EL TRAIN is heard and Trinity 
	turns to it, racing for the back of the building.

	The edge falls away into a wide back alley.  The next 
	building is over 40 feet away, but Trinity's face is 
	perfectly calm, staring at some point beyond the other 
	roof.

	The cops slow, realizing they are about to see something 
	ugly as Trinity drives at the edge, launching herself 
	into the air.

	From above, the ground seems to flow beneath her as she 
	hangs in flight

	Then hitting, somersaulting up, still running hard.

					COP
			Motherfucker -- that's impossible!

	They stare, slack-jawed, as Agent Brown duplicates the 
	move exactly, landing, rolling over a shoulder, up onto 
	one knee.

	Just below the building are the runbling tracks of 
	riveted steel.  The TRAIN SCREECHES beneath her, a 
	rattling blur of gray metal.  Trinity junps, landing
	easily.

	She looks back just as Agent Brown hurls through the air 
	barely reaching the last car

	Agent Brown stands, yanking out a gun.

	Trinity is running hard as BULLETS WHISTLE past her head.

	Ahead she sees her only chance, 50 feet beyond the point 
	where the train has begun to turn, there is --

	A window; a yellow glow in the midst of a dark brick
	building.

	Trinity zeroes in on it, running as hard as she can, her 
	speed compounded by the train.  The SCREAM of the STEEL 
	rises as she nears the edge where the train rocks into the
	turn.

	Trinity hurtles into the empty night space, her body 
	leveling into a dive.  She falls, arms covering her head
	as --

	The whole world seems to spin on its axis --

	And she crashes with an EXPLOSION of GLASS and WOOD, then 
	falls onto a back stairwell, tumbling, bouncing down
	stairs bleeding, broken --

	But still alive.

	Through the smashed window, she glimpses Agent Brown,
	still on the train, his tie and coat whipping in the
	wind; stone-faced, he touches his ear piece as the train 
	slides him past the window.

	Trinity tries to move.  Everything hurts.

					TRINITY
			Get up, Trinity.  You're fine.
			Get up -- just get up!

	She stands and limps down the rest of the stairs.


	EXT.  STREET

	Trinity emerges from the shadows of an alley and, at the 
	end of the block, in a pool of white street light, she
	sees it.

	The telephone booth.

	Obviously hurt, she starts down the concrete walk,
	focusing in completely, her pace quickening, as the PHONE
	begins to RING.

	Across the street, a garbage truck suddenly u-turns, its 
	TIRES SCREAMING as it accelerates.

	Trinity sees the headlights on the truck arcing at the
	telephone booth as if taking aim.

	Gritting through the pain, she races the truck --

	Slamming into the booth, the headlights blindingly
	bright, bearing down on the box of Plexiglas just as --

	She answers the phone.

	There is a frozen instant of silence before the hulking 
	mass of dark metal lurches up onto the sidewalk --

	Barreling through the booth, bulldozing it into a brick
	wall, smashing it to Plexiglas pulp.

	After a moment, a black loafer steps down from the cab of 
	the garbage truck.  Agent Smith inspects the wreckage.
	There is no body.  Trinity is gone.

	His jaw sets as he grinds his molars in frustration.
	AGENT JONES walks up behind him.

					AGENT SMITH
			Did you get anything from the
			room?

					AGENT JONES
			Their next target.  The name is
			Neo.

	The handset of the pay phone lays on the ground,
	separated in the crash like a severed limb.

					AGENT SMITH
			We'll need a search running.

					AGENT JONES
			It's already begun.

	We are SUCKED TOWARDS the mouthpiece of the phone, CLOSER 
	and CLOSER, UNTIL the smooth gray plastic spreads out 
	like a horizon and the small HOLES WIDEN until we fall
	through one --

	Swallowed by the darkness that becomes --

	A computer screen.

	We are on-line, inside a chat room called "The Matrix." 
	It is an exklusive web-site where hackers hang out.

					SCREEN
			JACKON:  I heard Morpheus has been
			on this board.
			SUPERASTIC:  Morpheus doesn't even
			exist and the Matrix is nothing 
			but an advertising gimmick 4 a new
			game.
			TIMAXE:  All I want to know is
			Trinity really a girl?
			LODIII:  87% of all women on line
			are really men.
			QUARK:  The Matrix is a euphemism 
			for the government.
			SUPERASTIC:  No, The Matrix is the
			system controlling our lives.
			TIMAXE:  You mean MTV.
			SUPERASTIC:  I mean Sega.
			FOS4:  ALL HAIL SEGA!!!

	We drift back from the electric conversation entering --


	INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT

	It is a studio apartirent that seems overgrown with
	technology.

	Weed-like cables coil everywhere, duct-taped into
	thickets that wind up and around the legs of several
	desks.

	Tabletops are filled with cannibalized equipment that lay
	open like an autopsied corpse.

	We turn towards the center of this rat-nest of
	technology, following the slurping and crunching of
	cereal.  We pass an open box of Capln Crunch as we find --

	NEO, a younger man who knows more about living inside a 
	computer than living outside one.

					NEO
			Fuckin' idiots don't know shit.

	He finishes his cereal and is about to disconnect when an 
	anonynous message slices onto the screen.

					SCREEN
			Do you want to know what the
			Matrix is, Neo?

	Neo is frozen when he reads his name.

					SCREEN
			SUPERASTIC:  Who said that?
			JACKON:  Who's Neo?
			GIBSON:  This is a private board.

			If you want to know, follow the
			white rabbit.

					NEO
			What the hell...

					SCREEN
			TIMAXE:  Someone is hacking the
			hackers!
			FOS4:  It's Morpheus!!!!!
			JACKON:  Identify yourself.

			Knock, knock, Neo.

	A chill runs down his spine and when someone KNOCKS on
	his door he almost jumps out of his chair.

	He looks at the door, then back at the computer but the
	message is gone.

	He shakes his head, not completely sure what happened.
	Again, someone knocks.

	Cautiously, Neo approaches the door.

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Hey, Tommy-boy!  You in there?

	Recognizing the voice, he relaxes and opens it.  ANTHONY,
	who lives down the hall, is standing outside with a group
	of friends.

					NEO
			What do you want, Anthony?

					ANTHONY
			I need your help, man.  Desperate.
			They got me, man.  The shackles of 
			fascism.

	He holds up the red notice that accompanies the Denver
	boot.

					NEO
			You got the money this time?

	He holds up two hundred dollars and Neo opens the door.
	Anthony's girlfriend, DUJOUR, stops in front of Neo.

					DUJOUR
			You can really get that thing off,
			right now?

					ANTHONY
			I told you, honey, he may look 
			like just another geek but this 
			here is all we got left standing 
			between Big Brother and the New
			World Order.


	EXT.  STREET

	A police officer unlocks a yellow metal boot from the
	wheel of an enormous oldsmobile.


	INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT

	They watch from the window as the cops, silently,
	robotically, climb into their van.

					ANTHONY
			Look at 'em.  Automatons.  Don't 
			think about what they're- doing or
			why.  Computer tells 'em what to
			do and they do it.

					FRIEND #l
			Thc banality of evil.

	He slaps the money in Neo's hand.

					ANTHONY
			Thanks, neighbor.

					DUJOUR
			Why don't you come to the party
			with us?

					NEO
			I don't know.  I have to work
			tomorrow.

					DUJOUR
			Come on.  It'll be fun.

	He looks up at her and suddenly notices on her black
	leather motorcycle jacket dozens of pins:  bands,
	symbols, slogans, military medals and --

	A small white rabbit.

	The ROOM TILTS.

					NEO
			Yeah, yeah.  Sure, I'll go.


	INT.  APARTMENT

	An older Chicago apartment; a series of halls connects a 
	chain of small high-ceilinged rooms lined with heavy
	casements.

	Smoke hangs like a veil, blurring the few lights there 
	are.

	Dressed predominantly in black, people are everywhere,
	gathered in cliques around pieces of furniture like
	jungle cats around a tree.

	Neo stands against a wall, alone, sipping from a bottle
	of beer, feeling completely out of place, he is about to
	leave when he notices a woman staring at him.

	The woman is Trinity.  She walks straight up to him.

	In the nearest room, shadow-like figures grind against
	each other to the pneumatic beat of INDUSTRIAL MUSIC.

					TRINITY
			Hello, Neo.

					NEO
			How did you know that --

					TRINITY
			I know a lot about you.  I've been
			wanting to meet you for some time.

					NEO
			Who are you?

					TRINITY
			My name is Trinity.

					NEO
			Trinity?  The Trinity?  The
			Trinity that cracked the I.R.S.
			Kansas City D-Base?

					TRINITY
			That was a long time ago.

					NEO
			Gee-zus.

					TRINITY
			What?

					NEO
			I just thought... you were a guy.

					TRINITY
			Most guys do.

	Neo is a little embarrassed.

					NEO
			Do you want to go sorewhere and
			talk?

					TRINITY
			No.  It's safe here and I don't
			have much time.

	The MUSIC is so loud they must stand very close, talking
	directly into each other's ear.

					NEO
			That was you on the board tonight.
			That was your note, wasn't it?

					TRINITY
			I had to gamble that you would see
			and they wouldn't.

					NEO
			Who wouldn't?

					TRINITY
			I can't explain everything to you.
			I'm sure that it's all going to
			seem very strange, but I brought
			you here to warn you, Neo.  You
			are in a lot of danger.

					NEO
			What?  Why?

					TRINITY
			They're watching you.  Something
			happened and they found out about
			you.  Normally, if our target is
			exposed we let it go.  But this
			time, we can't do that.

					NEO
			I don't understand --

					TRINITY
			You came here because you wanted
			to know the answer to a hacker's
			question.

					NEO
			The Matrix.  What is the Matrix?

					TRINITY
			Twelve years ago I met a man, a
			great man, who said that no one
			could be told the answer to that
			question.  That they had to see
			it, to believe it.

	Her body is against his; her lips very close to his ear.

					TRINITY
			He told me that no one should look
			for the answer unless they have to
			because once you see it,
			everything changes.  Your life and
			the world you live in will never
			be the same.  It's as if you wake
			up one morning and the sky is
			falling.

	There is a hypnotic quality to her voice and Neo feels
	the words like a drug, seeping into him.

					TRINITY
			The truth is out there, Neo.  It's
			looking for you and it will find
			you, if you want it to.

	She takes hold of him with her eyes.

					TRINITY
			That's all I can tell you right
			now.  Good-bye, Neo.  And good
			luck.

					NEO
			Wait.  Who was it?  Who was the
			man?

	She leans close, her lips alrost touching his ear as she
	whispers.

					TRINITY
			You know who.

	She turns and he watches her melt into the shifting wall
	of bodies.

	A SOUND RISES steadily, growing out of the music,
	pressing in on Neo until it is all he can hear as we --

							CUT TO:


	INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT

	The sound is an ALARM CLOCK, slowly dragging Neo to
	consciousness.  He strains to read the clock face:
	9:15 A.M.

					NEO
			Shitshitshit.


	EXT.  SKYSCRAPER

	The downtown office of CorTechs, a software development
	company.


	INT.  CORTECHS OFFICE

	The main offices are along each wall, the windows
	overlooking downtown Chicago.

	RHINEHEART, the ultimate company man, lectures Neo
	without looking at him, typing at his computer
	continuously.

	Neo stares at two window cleaners on a scaffolding
	outside, dragging their rubber squeegees down across the
	surface of the glass.

					RHINEHEART
			You have a problem, Mr. Anderson.
			You think that you're special.
			You believe that somehow the rules
			do not apply to you.

	He stops, glancing over his glasses at Neo, who turns in
	time.

					RHINEHEART
			Obviously, you are mistaken.

	His long, bony fingers resume clicking the keyboard.

					RHINEHEART
			This company is one of the top
			software companies in the world
			because every single employee
			understands that they are a part
			of a whole.  Thus, if an employee
			has a problem, the company has a
			problem.

	He turns again.

					RHINEHEART
			The time has come to make a 
			choice, Mr. Anderson.  Either you
			choose to be at your desk on time
			from this day forth, or you choose
			to find yourself another job.  Do
			I make myself clear?

					NEO
			Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.  Perfectly
			clear.

	INT.  NEO'S CUBICLE

	The entire floor looks like a human honeycomb, with a
	labyrinth of cubicles structured around a core of
	elevators.

	Neo slumps down into his chair.  A TALL EMPLOYEE stands
	up in the adjacent cubicle, leaning over the partition.

					TALL EMPLOYEE
			What did he say?

					NEO
			If I was late again, I'm going to
			be fired.

	He smirks.

					TALL EMPLOYEE
			Well, it was nice working with
			you.

	Neo glares at him, as he sinks down.

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Thomas Anderson?

	Neo turns and finds a FEDERAL EXPRESS MAN at his cubicle
	door.

					NEO
			Yeah.  That's me.

	Neo signs the electronic pad and the Fedex guy hands him
	the softpak.

					FEDEX
			Have a nice day.

	He opens the bag.  Inside is a CELLULAR PHONE.  It seems
	the instant it is in his hand, it RINGS.  Unnerved, he
	flips it open.

					NEO
			Hello?

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Hello, Neo.  This is Morpheus.

	Neo's knees give and he falls into his chair.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I had hoped for this conversation
			to take place under less adverse
			conditions, but you can never
			count on hope, can you, Neo?

					NEO
			... no.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I've been watching you, Neo, and I
			want to meet you.  I don't know if
			you're ready to see what I want to
			show you, but unfortunately, we
			have run out of time.  They're
			coming for you, Neo.  And I'm not
			sure what they're going to do.

					NEO
			Who's coming for me?

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Stand up and see for yourself.

					NEO
			Right now?

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Yes.  Now.

	Neo starts to stand.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Do it slowly.  Slowly.  The elevator.

	His head slowly peeks up over the partition.

	At the elevator, he sees Agent Brown and Agent Jones
	leading a group of cops.  A female employee turns and
	points out Neo's cubicle.

	Neo ducks.

					NEO
			Holy fuckin' shit!

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Yes.

	One cop stays at the elevator, the others follow the
	agents.

					NEO
			What the fuck do they want with
			me?!

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I'm not sure.  But, if you don't
			want to find out, you better get
			out of there.

					NEO
			How?!

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I can guide you out, but you have
			to do exactly what I say.

	The agents are moving quickly towards the cubicle.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			The cubicle across from you is
			empty.

					NEO
			But what if...?

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Go!  Now!

	Neo lunges across the hall, diving into the other cubicle
	just as the agents turn into his row.

	Neo crams himself into a dark corner, clutching the phone
	tightly to him.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Stay here for a moment.

	The agents enter Neo's empty cubicle.  A cop is sent to
	search the bathroom.

	Morpheus' voice is a whisper in Neo's ear.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			A little longer...

	Brown is talking to the tall employee.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			When I tell you, go to the end of
			the row to the first office on the
			left, stay.as low as you can.

	Sweat trickles down his forehead.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Now.

	Neo rolls out of the cubicle, his eyes popping as he
	freezes right behind a cop who has just turned around.

	Staying crouched, he sneaks away, down the row, SHOOTING
	across the opening to the first office on the left.

	The room is empty.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Good.  Now there is a window.
			Open it.

					NEO
			How do you know all this?

	Morpheus laughs quietly.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			The answer is coming, Neo.

	He opens the window.  The window howls into the room.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Outside, there's a scaffold.  You
			can use it to get to the roof.

	Leaning out the window, he sees that the scaffold is
	several offices away.

					NEO
			No! It's too far away.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			There's a small ledge.  It's a
			short climb.  You can make it.

	Neo looks down; the building's glass wall vertigos into a
	concrete chasm.

					NEO
			No way, no way, this is crazy.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Don't be controlled by your fear,
			Neo.  There are only two ways out
			of this building.  One is that
			scaffold.  The other is in their
			custody.  You take a chance either
			way.  I leave it to you.

	CLICK.  He hangs up.  Neo looks at the door, then back at
	the scaffold.

					NEO
			This is insane!  Why is this
			happening to me?  What did I do?
			I'm nobody.  I didn't do anything.
			Fuck! Fuck!  Fuck!

	He climbs up onto the window ledge.  Hanging onto the
	frame, he steps onto the small ledge.

	The scaffold seems even farther away.

					NEO
			I'm going to die.

	The WIND suddenly BLASTS up the face of the building,
	knocking Neo off balance.  Recoiling, he clings harder to
	the frame, and the phone falls out of his hand.

	He watches as it is swallowed by the distance beneath him.

					NEO
			This is insane.  I can't do this!
			Forget it!

	He climbs back into the office just as a cop opens the
	door.

					NEO
			I didn't do anything!


	EXT.  SKYSCRAPER

	The agents lead a handcuffed Neo out of the revolving
	doors, forcing his head down as they push him into the
	dark sedan.

	Trinity watches in the rear view mirror of her
	motorcycle.

					TRINITY
			Shit.

	INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM - CLOSE ON CAMERA MONITOR

	A wide angle view of a white roon, where Neo is sitting at
	a table alone.

	We MOVE INTO the monitor, ENTERING the room as if the
	monitor were a window.

	At the same moment, the door opens and the agents enter.

	Smith sits down across from Neo.  A thick manila envelope
	slaps down on the table between them.

	Neo glances at the name on the file: "Anderson, Thomas 
	A."

					AGENT SMITH
			As you can see, we've had our eye
			on you for some time now, Mr.
			Anderson.

	He opens the file.  Paper rattle marks the silence as he
	flips several pages.  Neo cannot tell if he is looking at
	the file or at him.

					AGENT SMITH
			It seems that you have been living
			two lives.  In one life, you are
			Thomas A. Anderson, program writer
			for a respectable software
			company.  You have a social
			security number, you pay your
			taxes and you help your land lady
			carry out her garbage.

	The pages continue to turn.

					AGENT SMITH
			The other life is lived in
			computers where you go by the
			hacker alias Neo, and are guilty
			of virtually every computer crime
			we have a law for, including the
			unauthorized use of the D.M.V.
			system for the removal of
			automobile boots.

	Neo feels himself sinking into a pit of shit.

					AGENT SMITH
			One of these,lives has a future.
			One of them does not.

	He closes the file.

					AGENT SMITH
			I'm going to be as forthcoming as
			I can be, Mr. Anderson.  You are
			here because we need your help.

	He removes his sunglasses; his eyes are an unnatural ice-
	blue.

					AGENT SMITH
			We know that you have been
			contacted by a certain individual.
			A man who calls himself Morpheus.
			Whatever you think you know about
			this man is irrelevant to the fact
			that he is wanted for acts of
			terrorism in more countries than
			any other man in the world.  He is
			considered by many authorities to
			be the most dangerous man alive.

	He leans closer.

					AGENT SMITH
			My colleagues believe that I am
			wasting my time with you, but I
			believe you want to do the right
			thing.  It is obvious that you are
			an intelligent man, Mr. Anderson,
			and that you are interested in the
			future.  That is why I believe you
			are ready to put your past
			mistakes behind you and get on
			with your life.

	Neo tries to match his stare.

					AGENT SMITH
			We are willing to wipe the slate
			clean, to give you a fresh start
			and all we are asking in return is
			your cooperation in bringing a
			known terrorist to justice.

	Neo nods to himself.

					NEO
			Yeah.  Wow.  That sounds like a
			real good deal.  But I think I
			have a better one.  How about I
			give you the finger --

	He does.

					NEO
			And you can cram that file up your
			Secret Service sphincter.

	Agent Smith puts his glasses back on.

					AGENT SMITH
			You disappoint me, Mr. Anderson.

					NEO
			You ain't seen nothing yet.

					AGENT SMITH
			The irony of your situation is
			that you have no choice.

					NEO
			You can't scare me with this
			gestapo crap.  I know my rights.
			I want my phone call.

	Agent Smith smiles.

					AGENT SMITH
			And tell me, Mr. Anderson, what
			good is a phone call iy you are
			unable to speak?

	The question unnerves Neo and strangely, he begins to
	feel the muscles in his jaw tighten.

	The standing agents snicker, watching Neo's confusion
	grow into panic.

	Neo feels his lips grow soft and sticky as they slowly
	seal shut, melding into each other until all trace of his
	mouth is gone.

	Wild with fear, he lunges for the door but the agents
	restrain him holding him in the chair.

					AGENT SMITH
			You are going to help us, Mr.
			Anderson, whether you want to or
			not.

	Smith nods and the other two rip open his shirt.

	From a case taken out of his suit coat, Smith removes a
	long, fiber-optic wire tap.

	Neo struggles helplessly as Smith dangles the wire over
	his exposed abdomen.  Horrified, he watches as the
	electronic device animates, become an organic creature
	that resembles a hybrid of an insect and a fluke worm.

	Thin, whisker-like tendrils reach out and probe into
	Neo's navel.  He bucks wildly as Smith drops the creature
	which looks for a moment like an uncut umbilical cord --

	Before it begins to burrow its, tail thrashing as it
	worms its way inside.


	INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Screaming, Neo bolts upright in bed.

	He realizes that he is home.  Was it a dream?  His mouth
	is normal.  His stomach looks fine.  He starts to take a
	deep, everything-is-okay breath, when --

	The PHONE RINGS.

	It almost stops his heart.  It CONTINUES RINGING,
	building pressure in the room, forcing him up out of bed,
	sucking him in with an almost gravitational force.

	He answers it, saying nothing.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.).
			This line is tapped, so I must be
			brief.

					NEO
			The agents --

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			They got to you first, but they've
			underestimated how important you
			are.  If they knew what I know,
			you would probably be dead.

	Neo feels sick.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I don't know what you are thinking
			right now but I want you to
			understand that I will not give up
			on you until you give up on me.

	Neo's throat cracks, dry as the Sahara.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Do you still want to meet?

					NEO
			... Yes.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Take the Howard line south.

	CLICK.  He closes his eyes, unsure of what he has done.


	EXT.  EL TRAIN

	An EL TRAIN RAGES against its metal rails.


	INT.  TRAIN

	It is three a.m., and the train carries the usual urban
	night crawlers.  Neo sits alone, eyes shifting, watching
	everything nervously.

	There is a METAL BANG and TRAIN CLATTER fills the car as
	the door is opened.

	Neo turns and sees a large man enter.  He is wearing
	sunglasses and a black leather jacket.  His name is APOC
	and he walks straight at Neo.

					APOC
			Come with me.

	Neo stands just as the door at the opposite end opens and
	two police officers rush in, drawing their guns.

	Apoc grabs Neo, muscling him to the nearest exit.  There
	is no upcoming station.

	Apoc yanks the emergency brake and the train buckles
	against its own speed.  The cops are thrown back.  Neo
	slams against the metal rail.

	The doors open onto nothing and just when Neo regains his
	balance, Apoc shoves him backwards --

	He flies out from the train, arms windrilling as he falls
	from, the raised tracks --

	Hurtling towards a busy city street when, out of nowhere,
	a truck races under him and --

	He crashes into a large dumpster-bed filled with empty
	boxes.


	INT.  TRUCK BED

	Still shaking his head, Neo realizes he is not alone.  A
	man named Cabie is aiming a big gun at him.  Trinity is
	next to him, talking into a cellular phone.

					TRINITY
			We got him.  Call the chop-shop.

	She hangs up.

					TRINITY
			Listen to me, Neo.  You have to,
			trust us.

	She tears off a long strip of black duct-tape and reaches
	for his face.

					NEO
			What are you doing?

					TRINITY
			This has to be done for your
			protection and ours.

	She seals his eyes shut with the tape.

					TRINITY
			You can't understand right now,
			but if you're not one of us,
			you're one of them.


	EXT.  LOWER WACKER

	A featureless black van glides up to a staircase that
	curls down from the city's surface.

	trinity guides the blind Neo down the steps.  The back of
	the van slaps open, revealing a young, skinny man who
	looks to be still in his teens, wearing an outfit that is
	a cross between a surgeon and a telephone repair man.

	His name is GIZMO and he smiles lewdly at Trinity,
	exposing his teeth that are wired with weird-looking
	braces.

					GIZMO
			Va va va voom.  Still the hottest
			software around.

					TRINITY
			Hello, Gizmo.

	Neo hears the voices around him.

					GIZMO
			This is really the guy?  The guy
			that Morpheus thinks --

					TRINITY
			Yeah.

					GIZMO
			But he's so old.

					TRINITY
			Are you going to help us or aren't
			you?

					GIZMO
			Hacksaw.  Load up the copper-top
			and let's get the hell outta here.

	Hacksaw is a huge man in a leather welder's apron.  He
	shoulders Neo and hauls him into the van.

	A moment later the green lights of Lower Wacker curve
	over the tinted windshield as the van rushes through the
	underworld.


	INT.  VAN

	The chop-shop is filled with electronic gadgets, wired to
	meters and monitors.  There are shelves lined with
	medical supplies and rows of hanging tools, knives,
	cleavers, and stainless steel clamps.

	Neo is strapped down to an ambulance cart, listening
	nervously as Gizmo gets to work.

					GIZMO
			Okay, first we take a little look
			under the hood.

	He pulls up the goggles hanging at his neck and they
	blink to life with tiny halogen lights and lenses irising
	to varying levels of magnification.

					GIZMO
			You're going to feel a little
			prick.

	He inserts acupuncture-like needles into Neo's lower
	abdomen.  The needles are wired to video monitors.
	Hacksaw pilots the fiber-optic lens.

					NEO
			What are you doing?

					TRINITY
			We think you're bugged.  We can't
			take you to Morpheus until you're
			clean.

					GIZMO
			There it is.

	On a monitor, we see the bug nestled in among Neols large
	intestines.

					GIZMO
			Hit him with 10 ccs of local.

	Hacksaw loads a hypodermic needle and pumps an anesthetic
	around Neols navel.

	Using a device that looks like a miniature speculum,
	Gizmo inserts a knuckled dental pick.  Typing into a
	calculator keypad wired to the pick, he automates the
	tip.

	On the monitor, we watch it telescope out and the end
	separate into a tiny hooked, metal claw.

					GIZMO
			Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

	The claw snags hold of the bug.

					GIZMO
			Gotcha!

	But the bug reacts violently.  Neo screams as it wraps
	itself around the soft tissue web of intestine.

					GIZMO
			Shit.

					TRINITY
			What's happening?

					GIZMO
			I don't know.  They've never done
			that before.

	Neo writhes in pain.

					GIZMO
			Hold him down.

					NEO
			Jesus!  God!

					TRINITY
			Do something!

					GIZMO
			I got it!  Maybe we can stun it.

					TRINITY
			Are you crazy?  That will kill
			him.

	We watch Neo, who can't see what they are talking about.

					GIZMO
			It'll work.  Come on, do it or
			Hacksaw will.

					NEO
			Do what?

	The instant he hears the word, he knows.

					TRINITY
			Clear.

					NEO
			Oh, shit --

	The cry is frozen in his mouth as the paddles hit his
	chest.  Gizmo wrestles with the bug.

					GIZMO
			Hit him again!

	Again, the electricity convulses through him as Gizmo
	yanks the speculum out.

					GIZMO
			Got it!

	Trinity touches Neo, who is just beginning to breathe.
	She eases the tape off his eyes.

					TRINITY
			Neo, are you okay?

	He nods.

					TRINITY
			It's over.  We got it.

	Hanging from the claw pick is the inanimate metal wire-
	tap.

					GIZMO
			Nasty little bugger, ain't it?


	INT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE

	The van stops in a deserted alley behind a forgotten
	hotel.  The doors open and Trinity helps Neo get out.

					TRINITY
			Thanks for your help, Gizmo.

					GIZMO
			I just hope the man knows what
			he's doing.

	She nods then climbs out of the van.  Gizmo ogles the
	tight leather pants.

					GIZMO
			Goddamn, what I wouldn't give for
			a copy of that software.

	Trinity turns around.

					TRINITY
			Gizmo, you don't have the hardware
			to handle this software.

	He howls with adolescent laughter as the van pulls away.
	Trinity turns to Neo.

					TRINITY
			Let's go.  He's waiting.


	INT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE

	It is a place of putrefying elegance, a rotting host of
	urban maggotry.

	Trinity leads Neo from the stairwell down the hall of the
	thirteenth floor.  They stop outside room 1313.

					TRINITY
			This is it.

	Neo can hear his own heart pounding.

					TRINITY
			Let me give one piece of advice.
			Be honest.  He knows more than you
			can possibly imagine.


	INT.  ROOM 1313

	Across the room, a dark figure stares out the tall
	windows veiled with decaying lace.  He turns and his
	smile lights up the room.

					MORPHEUS
			At last.

	He wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible
	behind circular mirrored glasses.

	He strides to Neo and they shake hands.

					MORPHEUS
			Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt
			have guessed, I am Morpheus.

					NEO
			It's an honor.

					MORPHEUS
			Please.  Come.  Sit.

	He nods to Trinity.

					MORPHEUS
			Thank you, Trinity.

	She bows her head sharply and exits through a door to an
	adjacent room.

	They sit across from one another in cracked, burgundy-
	leather chairs.

					MORPHEUS
			I imagine, right now, you must be
			feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling
			down the rabbit hole?

					NEO
			You could say that.

					MORPHEUS
			I can see it in your eyes.  You
			have the look of a man who accepts
			what he sees because he is
			expecting to wake up.

	A smile, razor-thin, curls the corner of his lips.

					MORPHEUS
			Ironically, this is not far from
			the truth.  But I'm getting ahead
			of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo,
			why are you here?

					NEO
			You're Morpheus, you're a legend.
			Most hackers would die to meet
			you.

					MORPHEUS
			Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we
			both know there's more to it than 
			that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?

					NEO
			No.

					MORPHEUS
			Why not?

					NEO
			Because I don't like the idea that
			I'm not in control of my life.

					MORPHEUS
			I know exactly what you mean.

	Again, that smile that could cut glass.

					MORPHEUS
			Let me tell you why you are here.
			You are here because you have the
			gift.

					NEO
			What gift?

					MORPHEUS
			I've watched you, Neo.  You do not
			use a computer like a tool.  You
			use it like it was part of
			yourself.  What you can do inside
			a computer is not normal.  I know.
			I've seen it.  What you do is
			magic.

	Neo shrugs.

					NEO
			It's not magic.

					MORPHEUS
			But it is, Neo.  It is.  How else
			would you describe what has been
			happening to you?

	He leans forward.

					MORPHEUS
			We are trained in this world to
			accept only what is rational and
			logical.  Have you ever wondered
			why?

	Neo shakes his head.

					MORPHEUS
			As children, we do not separate
			the possible from the impossible
			which is why the younger a mind is
			the easier it is to free while a
			mind like yours can be very
			difficult.

					NEO
			Free from what?

					MORPHEUS
			From the Matrix.

	Neo locks at his eyes but only sees a reflection of
	himself.

					MORPHEUS
			Do you want to know what it is,
			Neo?

	Neo swallows and nods his head.

					MORPHEUS
			It's that feeling you have had all
			your life.  That feeling that
			something was wrong with the
			world.  You don't know what it is
			but it's there, like a splinter in
			your mind, driving you mad,
			driving you to me.  But what is
			it?

	The LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back.

					MORPHEUS
			The Matrix is everywhere, it's all
			around us, here even in this room.
			You can see it out your window, or
			on your television.  You feel it
			when you go to work, or go to
			church or pay your taxes.  It is
			the world that has been pulled
			over your eyes to blind you from
			the truth.

					NEO
			What truth?

					MORPHEUS
			That you are a slave, Neo.  That
			you, like everyone else, was born
			into bondage...
			... kept inside a prison that you
			cannot smell, taste, or touch.  A
			prison for your mind.

	Outside, the WIND BATTERS a loose PANE of glass.

					MORPHEUS
			Unfortunately, no one can be told
			what the Matrix is.  You have to
			see it for yourself.

					NEO
			How?

					MORPHEUS
			Hold out your hands.

	In Neo's right hand, Morpheus drops a red pill.

					MORPHEUS
			This is your last chance.  After
			this, there is no going back.

	In his left, a blue pill.

					MORPHEUS
			You take the blue pill and the
			story ends.  You wake in your bed
			and you believe whatever you want
			to believe.

	The pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses.

					MORPHEUS
			You take the red pill and you stay
			in Wonderland and I show you how
			deep the rabbit-hole goes.

	Neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, with the
	moisture growing in his palms.

					MORPHEUS
			Remember that all I am offering is
			the truth.  Nothing more.

	Neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill.  The
	Cheshire smile returns.

					MORPHEUS
			Follow me.

	He leads Neo into the other room, which is cramped with
	high-tech equipment, glowing ash-bliie and electric green
	from the racks of monitors.

	Trinity, Apoc and Cypher look up as they enter.

					CYPHER
			Shit.

					TRINITY
			I knew he would.

	Cypher saddles up to Morpheus, talking in a hushed tone
	away from, Neo.

					CYPHER
			Morpheus, I know what you believe
			but I think this is a mistake.
			We're rushing him.  He's old.  I'm
			afraid he might pop.

					MORPHEUS
			Haven't I always told you, Cypher,
			not to let fear control your life.
			Apoc, are we on-line?

	Neo recognizes the large man from the El train.

					APOC
			Almost.

	He and Trinity are working quickly, hardwiring a complex
	system of monitors, modules and drives.

					NEO
			Apoc?  You wrote the Four Horsemen
			Virus.

					APOC
			That's right.

					MORPHEUS
			Neo, time is always against us.
			Will you take a seat there?

	In the center of the room sits a chair.  Near the chair
	is an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked.

					MORPHEUS
			I imagine you know sonething about
			virtual reality.

	Neo sits and Trinity begins gently fixing white electrode
	disks to his head, arns, and the back of his neck.

					NEO
			A little.

					MORPHEUS
			Tell me about it.

					NEO
			Essentially, it's a hardware
			system that uses an apparatus;
			headgear, gloves and whatever to
			make you feel that you are in a
			computer program.

					MORPHEUS
			If the virtual reality apparatus,
			as you called it, was wired to all
			of your senses and controlled them
			completely, would you be able to
			tell the difference between the
			virtual world and the real world?

					NEO
			You might not, no.

					MORPHEUS
			No, you wouldn't.

	Neo whispers to Trinity.

					NEO
			You did all this?

	She nods, placing a set of headphones over his ears.
	They are wired to an old hotel phone.

					MORPHEUS
			The pill you took is part of a
			trace program.  It's going to make
			things feel a bit strange.

	Distantly, through the ear phones, he hears Apoc POUNDING
	on a KEYBOARD.  Sweat beads his face.  His eyes blink and
	twitch when he notices the mirror.

	Wide-eyed he stares as it begins to heal itself, a
	webwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the
	mirror were becoming liquid.

					NEO
			Shit...

	Cypher works with Apoc checking reams of phosphorescent
	data.  Trinity monitors Neo's electric vital signs.

	Neo reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers
	disappear beneath the rippling surface.

	Quickly, he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror
	stretches in long rubbery strands like mirrored-taffy
	stuck to his fingertips.

					NEO
			What is this?  Mescaline?

					MORPHEUS
			Just relax, Neo.

	The strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away,
	until the fragile wisps of mirror thread break.

	With the TINKLING of GLASS, shimmering snowflakes
	of electric-blinking mercury fall, hit the ground, and
	fade.

	He looks at his hand; fingers distended into mirrored
	icicles that begin to melt rapidly, dripping, running
	like wax down his fingers, spreading across his palms
	where he sees his face reflected.

					NEO
			Uh-oh...

					TRINITY
			It's going into replication.

					MORPHEUS
			Apoc?

					APOC
			Still nothing.

	Morpheus takes out a cellular phone and dials a number.

					MORPHEUS
			Tank, we're going to need the
			signal soon.  Stay calm, Neo.

	The mirror gel seems to come to life, racing, crawling up
	his arns like hundreds of insects.

					NEO
			It's cold.

	The mirror creeps up his neck as Neo begins to panic,
	tipping his head as though he were sinking into the
	mirror, trying to keep his mouth up.

					NEO
			It's all over me --

	Morpheus is right next to him, with the phone.

					TRINITY
			I got a fibrillation!

					CYPHER
			I knew it, I knew it...

					MORPHEUS
			Shit!  Apoc?

	Streams of mercury run from Neo's nose.

					APOC
			Targeting... almost there.

	An ALARM, on Trinity's monitor ERUPTS.

					TRINITY
			He's going into arrest!

					CYPHER
			He's gonna pop!

					APOC
			Lock!  I got him!

					MORPHEUS
			Now, Tank now!

	His eyes tear with mirror, rolling up and closing as a
	high-pitched ELECTRIC SCREAM ERUPTS in the headphones --

	It is a piercing SHRIEK like a computer calling to
	another computer --

	Neo's body arches in agony and we are pulled like we were
	pulled into the holes of the phone

	Sucked into his SCREAM and swallowed by darkness.


	INT.  POWER PLANT - CLOSE ON MAN'S BODY

	Floating in a womb-red amnion.

	His body spasms, fighting against the thick gelatin.

	Metal tubes, surreal versions of hospital tubes, obscure
	his face.  Other lines like IVs are connected to limbs
	and cover his genitals.

	He is struggling desperately now.  Air bubbles into the
	Jell-O but does not break the surface.

	Pressing up, the surface distends, stretching like a red
	rubber coccon.

	Unable to breathe, he fights wildly to stand, clawing at
	the thinning elastic shroud --

	Until it ruptures, a hole widening around his mouth as he
	sucks for air.  Tearing himself free, he emerges from the
	cell.

	It is Neo.

	He is bald and naked, his body slick with gelatin.
	Dizzy, nauseous, he waits for his vision to focus.

	He is standing in an oval capsule of clear alloy filled
	with red gelatin, the surface of which has solidified
	like curdled milk.

	The IVs in his arms are plugged into outlets that appear
	to be grafted to his flesh.

	He feels the weight of another cable and reaches to the
	back of his head where he finds an enormous coaxial
	plugged and locked into the base of his skull.

	He tries to pull it out but it would be easier to pull
	off a finger.

	To either side he sees other tube-shaped pods filled with
	red gelatin; beneath the wax-like surface, pale and
	motionless, he sees other human beings.

	Fanning out in a circle, there are more.  All connected
	to a center core, each capsule like a red, dimly glowing
	petal attached to a black metal stem.

	Above him, level after, level, the stem rises seemingly
	forever.  He moves to the foot of the capsule and looks
	out.

	The image assaults his mind.

	Towers of glowing petals spiral up to incomprehensible
	heights, disappearing down into a dim murk like an
	underwater abyss.

	His sight is blurred and warped, exaggerating the
	intensity of the vision.  The sound of the PLANT is like
	the sound of the ocean heard from inside the belly of
	Leviathan.

	Below Neo, a petal detaches from the stem, bearing away
	the body of an old man like an automated barge even as a
	new pod rises up and plugs itself into the empty space.

	Inside the new capsule, its surface more translucent and
	pinkish in color, Neo sees a small baby.

	From above, a machine drops directly in front of Neo.

	He swallows his scream as it seems to stare at him.

	It is almost insect-like in its design; beautiful
	housings of alloyed metal covering organic-like systems
	of hard and soft polymers.

	A black particle beam washes over Neo, he reacts in pain
	as the scanner seems to expose the nervous system wired
	to the coaxial cable at his cerebral cortex.

	At the back of the neck, the cable lock spins and opens,
	disengaging.

	The cable pulls itself free, a long clear plastic needle
	and cerebrum-chip slides from the anterior of Neols skull
	with an ooze of blood and spinal fluid.  The other
	connective hoses snap free and snake away as --

	The back of the unit opens and a tremendous vacuum, like
	an airplane door opening, sucks the gelatin and then Neo
	into a black hole.


	INT.  WASTE LINE

	The pipe is a waste disposal system and Neo falls,
	sliding with the clot of gelatin.

	Banking through pipe spirals and elbows, flushing up
	through grease traps clogged with cily clunps of
	cellulite.

	Neo begins to drown when he is suddenly snatched from the
	flow of waste.

	The metallic cable then lifts, pulling him up into the
	belly of the futuristic flying nachine, hovering inside
	the sewer main line.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	The metal harness opens and drops the half-conscious Neo
	onto the floor.

	Human hands and arms help him up as he finds himself
	looking straight at Morpheus.

	Trinity and Apoc.  And others, dressed in bizarre, high-
	tech combat gear.

	Morpheus smiles.

					MORPHEUS
			Welcome to the real world, Neo.

	Neo passes out.

									FADE TO BLACK.

	We have no sense of time.  We hear VOICES whispering.

					MAN (O.S.)
			Do you think Morpheus is right?
			Do you think he could be the One?

					WOMAN (O.S.)
			It doesn't matter now.  But if
			he's wrong...

	FADE IN:

	NEO'S POV

	Neo's eyes flutter open.  We see Trinity's face above us,
	angelic in the fluorescent glow of a light stick.


	ANGLE ON NEO

					NEO
			... am I dead?

					TRINITY
			Far from it.

									FADE TO BLACK.


	FADE IN:


	ANGLE ON NEO

	He opens his eyes again, something tingling through him.
	He focuses and sees his body pierced with dozens of
	acupuncture-like needles wired to a strange device.

					DOZER
			He needs a lot of work.

					MORPHEUS
			I know.

	Dozer and Morpheus are operating on Neo.

					NEO
			What are you doing?

					MORPHEUS
			Your muscles have atrophied.
			We're rebuilding them.

	Fluorescent light sticks burn unnaturally bright.

					NEO
			Why do my eyes hurt?

					MORPHEUS
			You've never used them before.

	Morpheus takes his sunglasses off and puts them on Neo.
	Neo lays back.

					MORPHEUS
			Rest, Neo.  The answers are
			coming.


	INT.  NEO'S ROOM

	Neo wakes up from a deep sleep, feeling better.  He is
	wearing a black tank top and shorts.

	He begins to examine himself.  There is a futuristic IV
	plugged into the jack in his forearm.  He pulls it out,
	staring at the grafted outlet.

	He feels his bald head.  His fingers find and explore the
	large outlet in the base of his skull.

	Just as he starts to come unglued, Morpheus opens the
	door.

					NEO
			Morpheus, what's happened to me?
			What is this place?

					MORPHEUS
			More important than what is when?

					NEO
			When?

					MORPHEUS
			You believe the year is 1997 when
			in fact it is much closer to 2197.
			I can't say for certain what year
			it is because we honestly do not
			know.

	The wind is knocked from Neo's chest.

					NEO
			That's not possible.

					MORPHEUS
			I promised you the truth, Neo, and
			the truth is that the world you
			were living in was a lie.

					NEO
			How?

					MORPHEUS
			I'll show you.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Like a sleepwalker, Neo follows Morpheus through the ship.

					MORPHEUS
			This is my ship, the
			Nebuchadnezzar.  It's a
			hovercraft.  Small like a
			submarine.  It's dark.  It's
			cramped and cold.  But it's home.

	They climb a ladder up to the main deck.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Everyone is there.

					MORPHEUS
			This is the main deck.  You know
			most of my crew.

	Trinity smiles and nods.

					MORPHEUS
			The ones you don't know.  That's
			Mouse and Switch.  The two big
			guys are Tank and Dozer.

	The names and faces wash meaninglessly over Neo.

					MORPHEUS
			And this, this is the Core.  This
			is where we broadcast our pirate
			signal and hack into the Matrix.

	It is a swamp of bizarre electronic equipment.  Vines of
	coaxial hang and snake to and from huge monolithic
	battery slabs, a black portable satellite dish and banks
	of little systems and computer monitors.

	At the center of the web, there are six ectoskeleton
	chairs made of a poly-alloy frame and suspension harness.

	Near the circle of chairs is the control console and
	operator's station where the network is monitored.

					MORPHEUS
			Help him, Trinity.

	Neo allows himself to be helped into one of the chairs.

					MORPHEUS
			Do you remember when I asked you
			about an apparatus that could turn
			a virtual reality into reality?

	Neo nods.

					MORPHEUS
			It's right here.

	He touches Neo's head.

					MORPHEUS
			And it's accessed here.

	Neo feels Morpheus guiding a coaxial line into the jack
	at the back of his neck.  The cable has the same kind of
	cerebellum chip we saw inside the plant.

					MORPHEUS
			This will feel a little weird.

	There are several disturbing NOISES as he works the
	needle in.

	We MOVE IN as Neo's shoulders bunch and his face tightens
	into a grimace until a loud CLICK fires and his ears pop
	like when you equalize them underwater.

	He relaxes, opening his eyes as we pull back to a feeling
	of weightlessness inside another place --


	INT.  CONSTRUCT

	Neo is standing in an empty, blank-white space.

					MORPHEUS
			This is the Construct.

	Startled, Neo whips around and finds Morpheus now in the
	room with him.

					MORPHEUS
			It is our loading program.  We can
			load anything from clothes, to
			weapons, to training simulations.
			Anything we need.

	Morpheus walks past Neo and when Neo turns he sees the
	two leather chairs from the hotel set up in front of a
	large-screen television.

					MORPHEUS
			Sit down.

	Neo stands at the back of the chair as Morpheus sits.

					NEO
			Right now, we're inside a computer
			program?

					MORPHEUS
			Wild, isn't it?

	Neo's hands run over the cracked leather.

					NEO
			This isn't real?

					MORPHEUS
			What is real?  How do you define
			real?  If you're talking about
			your senses, what you feel, taste,
			smell, or see, then all you're
			talking about are electrical
			signals interpreted by your brain.

	He picks up a remote control and clicks ON the
	TELEVISION.  We drift through the Windy City circa 1996.

					MORPHEUS
			This is the Chicago you know.
			Chicago as it was at the end of
			the twentieth century.  This
			Chicago exists only as part of a
			neural-interactive simulation that
			we call the Matrix.

	We GLIDE AT the television as he changes the channel.

					MORPHEUS
			You have been living inside
			Baulliaurd's vision, inside the
			map, not the territory.  This is
			Chicago as it exists today.

	The sky is an endless sea of black and green bile.  The
	earth, scorched and split like burnt flesh, spreads out
	beneath us as we ENTER the television.

					MORPHEUS
			'The desert of the real.'

	In the distance, we see the ruins of a future Chicago
	protruding from the wasteland like the blackened ribs of
	a long-dead corpse.

					MORPHEUS
			We are, right now, miles below the
			earth's surface.  The only place
			humans can survive outside the
			Matrix is underground.

	Still MOVING, we TURN and find Neo and Morpheus; the
	chairs now sitting in the middle of the black desert.
	Dizzy, Neo holds onto the chair.

					NEO
			What happened?

					MORPHEUS
			It started early in the twenty-
			first century, with the birth of
			artificial intelligence, a
			singular consciousness that
			spawned an entire race of
			machines.

	In his sunglasses, we see storm clouds gather.

					MORPHEUS
			At first all they wanted was to be
			treated as equals, entitled to the
			same human inalienable rights.
			Whatever they were given, it was
			not enough.

	In the circular window of the glasses, EXPLOSIONS light
	up a bloody battle field.

					MORPHEUS
			We don't know who struck first.
			Us or them.  But sometime at the
			end of the twenty-first century
			the battle was joined.

	We MOVE INTO his glasses and the war surrounds us.

					MORPHEUS
			The war raged for generations and
			turned the face of our planet from
			green and blue to black and red.

	At last we see the Sentinels; killing machines that are
	at once terrifying and beautiful.  They have an organic
	architecture like a microbiotic organism, that is
	perpetually in motion.

	The Sentinel cracks the body armor of a soldier,
	splitting open the soft, stearing meat inside.

					MORPHEUS
			It scorched and burned the sky.
			Without the sun, the machines
			sought out a new energy source to
			survive.

	The Sentinel locks up, as heat lightning of black ink
	bursts against the sky, spreading into a permanent cloud
	of stain.

					MORPHEUS
			They discovered a new form of
			fusion.  All that was required to
			initiate the reaction was a small
			electric charge.  Throughout human
			history we have been dependent on
			machines to survive.  Fate, it
			seems, is not without a sense of
			irony.

	We return to the power plant that Neo escaped from where
	we see human beings looking almost blissful in their
	gelatin cocoons.

					MORPHEUS
			The human body generates more bio-
			electricity than a 120-volt
			battery and over 25,000 B.T.U.'s
			of body heat.

	Outside, spreading all around the power plant, beneath a
	breathing greenhouse, are the growing fields.

					MORPHEUS
			We are, as an energy source,
			easily renewable and completely
			recyclable, the dead liquified and
			fed intravenously to the living.

	Huge farm-like reapers are harvesting the crop.

					MORPHEUS
			All they needed to control this
			new battery was something to
			occupy our mind.

	We see inside a clear tubular husk.  Floating in viscous
	fluid, there is a human fetus; its soft skull already
	growing around the brain-jack.

					MORPHEUS
			And so they built a prison out of
			our past, wired it to our brains
			and turned us into slaves.

	We PULL BACK to find the image is now on the television
	and we are again inside the white space of the Construct.

					NEO
			No!  I don't believe it!  It's not
			possible!

					MORPHEUS
			I didn't say that it would be
			easy, Neo.  I just said that it
			would be the truth.

	The room without walls begins to spin.

					NEO
			Stop!  Let me out!  I want out!


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	His eyes snap open and he thrashes against the chair,
	trying to rip the cable from the back of his neck.

					NEO
			Get this thing out of me!

					TRINITY
			Easy, Neo.  Easy.

	Dozer holds him while Trinity unlocks it.  Once it's out,
	he tears away from them, falling as he trips free of the
	harness.

					NEO
			Don't touch me!  Get away from me!

	On his hands and knees, he reels as the world spins.
	Sweat pours off him as a pressure builds inside his skull
	as if his brian had been put into a centrifuge.

					CYPHER
			He's going to pop!

	Vomiting violently, Neo pitches forward and blacks out.


	INT.  NEO'S ROOM

	He blinks, regaining consciousness.  The room is dark.
	Neo is stretched out on his bed.

					NEO
			I can't go back, can I?

	Morpheus sitting like a shadow on a chair in the far
	corner.

					MORPHEUS
			No.  But if you could, would you
			really want to?

	Neo isn't sure of that answer.

					MORPHEUS
			I feel that I owe you an apology.
			There is a rule that we do not
			free a mind once it reaches a
			certain age.  It is dangerous.
			They have trouble letting go..
			Their mind turns against them.
			I've seen it happen.  I broke the
			rule because I had to.

	He stares into the darkness, confessing as much to
	himself as Neo.

					MORPHEUS
			When the Matrix was first built
			there was a man born inside that
			had the ability to change what he
			wanted, to remake the Matrix as he
			saw fit.  It was this man that
			freed the first of us and taught
			us the secret of the war; control
			the Matrix and you control the
			future.

	He pauses.

					MORPHEUS
			When he died, the Oracle at the
			temple of Zion prophesied his
			return and envisioned an end to
			the war and freedom for our
			people.  That is why there are
			those of us that have spent our
			entire lives searching the Matrix,
			looking for him.

	Neo can feel his eyes on him.

					MORPHEUS
			I did what I did, because I
			believe we have been brought here
			for a reason, Neo.  You are here
			to serve a purpose, just as I am
			here to serve mine.

					NEO
			I told you I don't believe in
			fate.

	Morpheus smiles, leaning towards hin.

					MORPHEUS
			But I do, Neo.  I do.

	He stands up.

					MORPHEUS
			Get some rest.  You're going to
			need it.

					NEO
			For what?

					MORPHEUS
			Your training.



	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	There is no morning; there is only darkness and then the
	fluorescent light sticks flicker on.


	INT.  NEO'S ROOM

	Neo is awake in his bed, staring up at the lights.  The
	door opens and TA.NK steps inside.

					TANK
			Morning.  Did you sleep?

					NEO
			No.

					TANK
			You will tonight.  I guarantee it.
			I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator.

	He offers his hand and Neo shakes it.  He notices that
	Tank doesn't have any jacks.

					NEO
			You don't have...

					TANK
			Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my
			brother Dozer, we are 100 percent
			pure, old fashioned, home-grown
			human.  Born free.  Right here in
			the real world.  Genuine child of
			Zion.

					NEO
			Zion?

					TANK
			Zion is the place, man.  You'll
			see it one day.  Last human city.
			All we got left.

	Tank smiles.

					TANK
			Goddamn, I got to tell you I'm
			fairly excited to see what you are
			capable of.  I mean if Morpheus is
			right and all.  We're not supposed
			to talk.about any of that, but if
			you are, well then this is an
			exciting time.  We got a lot to do
			so let's get to it.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Neo is plugged in, hanging in one of the suspension
	chairs.

					TANK
			We're supposed to load all these
			operations programs first, but
			this is some major boring shit.
			Why don't we start something a
			little fun?

	Tank smiles as he plops into his operator's chair.  He
	begins flipping through a tall carousel loaded with micro
	discs.

					TANK
			How about sore combat training?

	Neo reads the label on the disk.

					NEO
			Jiujitsu?  I'm going to learn
			jujitsu?

	Tank slides the disk into Neo's supplement drive.

					NEO
			No way.

	Smiling, Tank punches the "load" code.

	His body jumps against the harness as his eyes clamp
	shut.  The monitors kick wildly as his heart pounds,
	adrenaline surges, and his brain sizzles.

	An instant later his eyes snap open.

					NEO
			Holy shit!

					TANK
			Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready
			for more?

					NEO
			Hell yes!


	INT.  MAIN DECK - CLOSE ON COMPUTER MONITOR - LATER

	as grey pixels slowly fill a small, half-empty box.  It
	is a meter displaying how much download time is left.

	The title bar reads:  "Combat Series 10 of 12," file
	categories flashing beneath it:  Savate, Jujitsu, Ken Po,
	Drunken Boxing...

	Morpheus walks in.

					MORPHEUS
			How is he?

	Tank looks at his watch, rubs his eyes.

					TANK
			Ten hours straight.  He's a
			machine.

	Neo's body spasms and relaxes as his eyes open, breath
	hissing from his lips.  He looks like he just orgasmed.

	He locks at Morpheus.

					NEO
			This is incredible.  I know Kung
			Fu.

	Morpheus sits in the drive chair next to hin.  He nods to
	Tank.

					MORPHEUS
			Show me.


	INT.  DOJO

	They are standing in a very sparse japanese-style dojo.

					MORPHEUS
			This is a sparring program,
			similar to the programmed reality
			of the Matrix.  Consider this your
			first lesson.

	He assumes a fighting stance.

					MORPHEUS
			Attack me.

	Neo assumes a similar stance, cautiously circling until
	he gives a short cry and launches a furious attack.

	It is like a Jackie Chan movie at high speed, fists and
	feet striking from every angle as Neo presses his attack
	--

	But each and every blow is blocked by effortless speed.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	While their minds battle in the programmed reality, the
	two bodies appear quite serene, suspended in the drive
	chairs.

	Tank monitors their life systems noticing that Neo is
	wildly and chaotically lit up as opposed to the slow and
	steady rhythm of Morpheus.


	INT.  MESS HALL

	Dinner is up.  Everyone is eating bowls of single-cell
	protein.  It has a cottage cheese consistency.

	MOUSE bursts in the room.

					MOUSE
			Morpheus is fighting Neo!

	All at once they bolt for the door.


	INT.  DOJO

	Neo's face is knotted, teeth clenched, as he hurls
	himself at Morpheus.

					MORPHEUS
			Good.  Adaption.  Improvisation.
			But your weakness isn't your
			technique.

	Morpheus attacks him and it is like nothing we have seen.
	His feet and fists are everywhere taking Neo apart.  For
	every blow Neo blocks, five more hit their marks until --

	Neo falls.

	Panting, on his hands and knees, blood spits fror, his
	mouth speckling the white floor of the Dojo.

					MORPHEUS
			How did I beat you?

					NEO
			You -- You're too fast.

					MORPHEUS
			Do you think my being faster,
			stronger has anything to do with
			my muscles in this place?

	Neo is frustrated, still unable to catch his breath.

					MORPHEUS
			Do you believe that's air you are
			breathing now?

	Neo squints at him.

					MORPHEUS
			If you can free your mind, the
			body will follow.

	Neo stands, nodding.

					MORPHEUS
			Again.

	Their fists fly with  pneumatic speed.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Everyone is gathered behind Tank, watching the fight,
	like watching a game of Mortal Combat.

					CABLE
			Jeezus Keerist!  That boy is fast!

					MOUSE
			You ever seen anyone that fast
			that soon, Tank?

					TANK
			Never.

					APOC
			Morpheus is right.  He's got to be
			the one.


	INT.  DOJO

	The speed of the blows rises like a drum solo that seems
	impossible to sustain.  Neo's face sheds its mask of calm
	with a scream.

	He wants to beat Morpheus bad.

	Finally a single blow catches Morpheus on the side of the
	head, knocking his glasses off.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	There are several gasps.

					MOUSE
			I don't believe it!


	INT.  DOJO

	Morpheus rubs his face.

					MORPHEUS
			You are angry with me.

	Neo pants.

					NEO
			I, uh... maybe.

					MORPHEUS
			It's all right.  It's natural.

					NEO
			I feel better.

					MORPHEUS
			Good, good.  Anger is a gift, Neo,
			but it's a heavy one.

	Morpheus smiles.

					MORPHEUS
			Tank, load the jump program.

	Neo straightens as the dojo DISSOLVES away like a curtain
	lifting, leaving the two men now standing on a building
	rooftop in a city skyline.

					MORPHEUS
			You have to learn to let go of
			that anger.  You must let go of
			everything.

	A WIND HOWLS, whipping Morpheus' long coat to the side.

					MORPHEUS
			You must empty yourself to free
			your mind.

	Morpheus spins, running hard at the edge of the rooftop.
	And jumps.  He sails through the air, his coat billowing
	out behind him like a cape --

	Somersaults once and lands on the rooftop across the
	street.

					NEO
			Shit.

	Neo looks down at the street twenty floors below, then at
	Morpheus an impossible fifty feet away.

					NEO
			Okie dokie.

	He takes a deep breath.

					NEO
			Yeah.  Free my mind.  Right.  No
			problem.

	He concentrates.  Runs.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	They are transfixed.

					CABLE
			He's gonna make it.

					APOC
			No way.  Not possible.

					MOUSE
			No one's ever made their first
			jump.

					SWITCH
			What if he does?

					APOC
			He won't.

					TANK
			It's never been done.

	Trinity stares at the screen, her fists clenching as she
	whispers.

					TRINITY
			Come on.


	EXT.  ROOFTOP

	Summoning every ounce of strength in his legs, Neo
	launches himself into the air in a single maniacal shriek
	--

	But comes up drastically short.

	His eyes widen as he plummets.  Stories fly by, the
	ground rushing up at him, but as he hits --

	The ground gives way, stretchinp like a trapeze net.

	He bounces and flips, slowly coming to a rest, flat on
	his back.

	He laughs, a bit unsure, wiping the wind-blown tears from
	his face.

	Morpheus exits the building and helps him to his feet.

					MORPHEUS
			Everyone falls the first time.

	Neo nods quietly.

					MORPHEUS
			If you never know failure, how can
			you know success?


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	They break up.

					MOUSE
			What does it mean?

					CABLE
			It doesn't mean anything.

					CYPHER
			Everyone falls, right, Trinity?

	But Trinity has left.

	Neo's eyes open as Tank eases the plug out.  He tries to
	move and groans, cradling his ribs.

	While Tank helps Morpheus, Neo spits blood into his hand.

					NEO
			I thought it wasn't real.

	Neo stares at the blood.

					NEO
			If you are killed in the Matrix,
			you die here?

					MORPHEUS
			The body cannot live without the
			mind.


	INT.  NEO'S ROOM

	Trinity enters from the hall, carrying a try of food.

					TRINITY
			Neo, I saved you some dinner --

	She sees him passed out on the bed.  She sets the tray
	down and pulls the blanket over him.

	She pauses, her face close to his, then inhales lightly,
	breathing in the scent of him, before slowly pulling away.

	It seems the moment she closes the door, he wakes with a
	start, unsure of where he is.  After a moment, he gets
	out of bed.


	INT.  HALL

	The ship is quiet and dark.  Everyone is asleep.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	The core glows with monitor light.  Cypher is in the
	operator's chair as Neo cones up behind him.

					CYPHER
			Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the
			bejeezus out of ne.

					NEO
			Sorry.

					CYPHER
			No, it's all right.

					NEO
			What are you doing?

					CYPHER
			Midnight watch.

	Neo's eyes light up as he steps closer to the screens
	that seem alive with a constant flow of data.

					NEO
			Is that... ?

					CYPHER
			The Matrix?  Yeah.

	The monitors are packed with bizarre codes and equations.

					CYPHER
			You want a drink?

	He pours Neo a drink from a large plastic jug.

					CYPHER
			I'll tell you, I feel for you,
			man.  I really do.  Most of us
			were still young, just punks, when
			Morpheus jacked us.  But you, you
			had a real life.

	Neo takes a sip and it almost kills him.  Cypher pounds
	on his back.

					CYPHER
			Good shit, huh?  Dozer makes it.
			It's good for two things:
			degreasing engines and killing
			brain cells.

	Red-faced, Neo finally stops coughing.

					CYPHER
			Did he tell you why he did it?

	Neo nods.

					CYPHER,
			I'll be the didn't tell you that
			this wasn't the first time he
			thought he found the One.

	Neo shakes his head as Cypher fills his cup and laughs.

					CYPHER
			Let me give you a piece of advice.
			Between you and me, if Morpheus
			says you can fly, I wouldn't go
			jumping out any windows to find
			out if he's right.  Understand?

	Cypher raises his drink.  Neo swallows another throat-
	scorching mouthful.

					CYPHER
			Welcome to the real world!


	INT.  RESTAURANT (MATRIX) - NIGHT

	CHAMBER MUSIC and the ambiance of wealth soak the room as
	we watch a serrated knife saw through a thick, gorgeous
	steak.

					CYPHER
			That's what he said to me nine
			years ago.

	The meat is so perfect, charred on the outside, oozing
	red juice from the inside, that it could be a dream.

					CYPHER
			The real world.  Ha, what a joke.

	We recognize the grating voice, the insidious laugh.

					CYPHER
			You know what real is?  I'll tell
			you what real is.

	A fork stabs the cube of meat and we FOLLOW it UP TO the
	face of Cypher.

					CYPHER
			Real is just another four-letter
			word.

	He laughs, shoving the steak into his mouth.

	The restaurant is located on the top floor of a Chicago
	skyscraper where the view is breathtaking and the menu
	has no prices.

	Sitting across from Cypher is Agent Smith.

					AGENT SMITH
			Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

	Cypher chews the steak loudly, smacking it between his
	teeth.

					CYPHER
			Mmm, so, so fucking good.

	Smith watches him shovel another hunk of meat into his
	mouth.

					CYPHER
			You know, I know that this steak
			doesn't exist.  I know when I put
			it in my mouth, the Matrix is
			telling my brain that it is juicy
			and delicious.  After nine years,
			do you know what I've realized?

	Pausing, he examines the meat skewered on his fork.  He
	pops it in, eyes rolling up, savoring the tender beef
	melting in his mouth.

					CYPHER
			Ignorance is bliss.

					AGENT SMITH
			Then we have a deal?

					CYPHER
			I don't want to remember nothing.
			Nothing!  You understand?  And I
			want to be rich.  Someone
			important.  Like an actor.  You
			can do that, right?

					AGENT SMITH
			Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

	Cypher takes a deep drink of wine.

					CYPHER
			All right.  You get my body back
			in a power plant, reinsert me into
			the Matrix and I'll get you what
			you want.

					AGENT SMITH
			Access codes to Zion.

					CYPHER
			I told you, I don't know them.
			But I can give you the man who
			does.

					AGENT SMITH
			Morpheus.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Sweat dapples his lip as Neo snaps out of the construct
	coma.

					NEO
			Jeez, I was wondering about that.

					TANK
			What?

					NEO
			Why I was bald here but not in the
			Matrix.

					TANK
			R.S.I.

					NEO
			Residual self image.

					TANK
			Good.  Now what's this?

	He points to one of Neo's monitors.

					NEO
			Life systems monitor, glucose
			levels.

					TANK
			What's that?

					NEO
			Main power supply to the core.

	He follows Tank to the operator's station where he points
	to a red key-switch.

					TANK
			How about this?

					NEO
			Mainframe self-destruct.  Uses all
			remaining power to generate an...
			E.M.P?

					TANK
			Electromagnetic pulse.  Our best
			weapon against the machines.  The
			problem is if someone is still in
			the Matrix when that thing goes
			off, they're not coming back.

	Neo nods as Morpheus comes up behind them.

					MORPHEUS
			How's he doing?

					TANK
			We just finished the operation
			programs and he's showing great
			retention.

					MORPHEUS
			Good.  I want everyone alerted to
			12-hour stand-by.  We're going in.
			Neo, it's time for you to know why
			you're here.

	Morpheus walks away.

					NEO
			What's he talking about?

					TANK
			He's taking you into the Matrix to
			see her.

					NEO
			See who?

					TANK
			The Oracle.

	Neo looks down at the monitor teeming with Matrix data
	that seems to coalesce, equations giving way to images as
	a METAL SCREAM RISES BECOMING --


	EXT.  CHICAGO (MATRIX) - DAY

	An El train.


	INT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	The room is empty, heavy curtains covering windows.  It
	looks as if it hasn't been touched in years.  In the
	bedroom with the cracked oval mirror an old black PHONE
	begins to RING.

	In the mirror, we first glimpse them and as we keep
	TURNING, the room fills with equipment and the team.

	Morpheus answers the phone.

					MORPHEUS
			We're in.

	He hangs up.

					MORPHEUS
			Mouse and Cable hold the exit.
			Let's go.


	INT.  STAIRWELL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo follows the others down the stairwell that winds
	around an antique elevator shaft.

					NEO
			Did you have to do this?

					TRINITY
			Yeah.

					NEO
			What did she tell you?

					TRINITY
			Lots of things.

					NEO
			Any of them true?

	Trinity looks at him, then looks away.

					TRINITY
			Some of them.

					GIZMO
			Were they good or bad?

					TRINITY
			There's no point in worrylng.
			Whatever is going to happen is
			going to happen.

	They cross the old lobby.  Switch and Apoc stop at the
	doors.

					MORPHEUS
			We should be back in an hour.


	EXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo squints into the sun that seems unnaturally bright.
	He is the only one without sunglasses.

					MORPHEUS
			Do you now understand what it
			means when we say, if you're not
			one of us, you're one of them?

					NEO
			The agents.  They're sentient
			programs.  They can commandeer any
			software hardwired to the
			mainframe.

					MORPHEUS
			Anyone that is still in a power
			plant.  That is why we try to be
			invisible in the Matrix.

					NEO
			The best hacking is always
			traceless.

	Cypher and Trinity move away from them, securing the
	perimeter.  As Cypher passes a garbage can, he
	surreptitiously drops something inside.

	It is a cellular phone and we watch the blue display as
	the LINE CONNECTS.

	An early 1970s, black Lincoln Continental emerges from a
	corrugated roll-up garage.  Morpheus and Neo get in.


	INT.  LINCOLN CONTINENTAL (MATRIX) - DAY

	An enormous man is waiting for them.  A wad of chewing
	tobacco bulges his cheek.  He spits into a Coke can.

					MOJO
			Morpheus, been a long time coming.

					MORPHEUS
			You're looking well, Mojo.

	Mojo coughs a brown, cankerous laugh, juice speckling his
	chin and shirt.  He stares at Neo.

					MOJO
			You bringing us geriatrics now.
			Morpheus?

	He spits and laughs again.

					MOJO
			Guess you are locking for a
			miracle.


	EXT.  BAR (MATRIX) - DAY

	The Continental pulls up to a bar in the kind of
	neighborhood where every corner has a pair of eyes.


	INT.  BAR (MATRIX) - DAY

	A lightless, lower-class bar.  No one enters that is not
	expected.

	The front doors open in a brilliant burst of sunlight as
	Mojo leads Morpheus and Neo inside.  Neo looks around,
	his eyes adjusting to the darkness.

	Mojo talks to the bartender, then looks over.

					MOJO
			All right, it's cool.  Go on back.

	They weave their way to the back of the bar, the STICKY
	FLOOR SNAPPING under their FEET.

	A monolith of a man rises from his stool as they walk up.

					REX
			You're late.

	He moves to the side, opening the heavy iron door behind
	him.  They descend the basement staircase toward the
	single bare bulb at the bottom, hanging above the only
	door.


	INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

	A high-tech laptop and modem are set up on a stack of
	milk crates.  Neo waits as Morpheus types in a series of
	access codes.  After a moment the screen blinks, "Welcome
	Morpheus."

	Morpheus walks back to the same door they entered, but it
	now leads into --


	INT.  TEMPLE OF ZION (MATRIX) - DAY

	The walls and floors are polished marble.  Neo follows,
	his mouth agape.

					NEO
			What -- what happened?

					MORPHEUS
			This is the temple.  It is a part
			of Zion's mainframe.  It's hidden
			inside the Matrix so that we can
			access it.

	Two PRIESTESSES are waiting in the antechamber.

					PRIESTESS
			Hello, Morpheus.  We've been
			expecting you.

					MORPHEUS
			Okay, you're on your own.  Go with
			them.

	They take Neo by the arm, leading him down a hall into
	another room.

					PRIESTESS
			Wait here.  Among the other
			Potentials.


	INT.  ROOM OF POTENTIALS (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo enters and finally understands the attention given to
	his age.  The Potentials are all little children.

	The room feels at once like a Buddhist temple and a
	kindergarten class.  The children's heads are either
	shaved or thick with dreadlocks.  Some are playing,
	others meditating or practicing their gift.

	Neo watches a little girl levitate wooden alphabet
	blocks.  A skinny BOY holds a SPOON which sways like a
	blade of grass as he bends it with his rnind.

	Neo crosses to him, sits.

	The Boy smiles as Neo picks up a spoon and tries to
	imitate him.  Despite his best efforts, Neo cannot make
	it bend.

					SPOON BOY
			Your spoon does not bend because
			it is just that, a spoon.  Mine 
			bends because there is no spoon,
			just my mind.

	Neo watches as it curls into a knot.

					SPOON BOY
			Link yourself to the spoon.
			Become the spoon and bend
			yourself.

	Neo nods, again holding up his spoon.

					NEO
			There is no spoon.  Right.

	He concentrates.  The spoon begins to bend just as the
	Priestess touches his shoulder.

					PRIESTESS
			The Oracle will see you now.

	Spoon Boy smiles.


	INT.  SHRINE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo enters nervously.  Beneath his feet is a path of the
	zodiac leading to marbled stairs that rise to a dais and
	a three-legged throne.

	The throne is empty.

					NEO
			Hello?

	A DISTANT FEMALE VOICE calls to him and he follows it up
	the stairs.  At the top of the dais, he smells something
	cooking.

	Following the scent, he moves behind the pillars where he
	finds an open door.

					VOICE (O.S.)
			Just come on in.

	He walks through a vestibule where he sees a fabulous
	moonstone headdress and velvet robes.  A second door
	leads into --


	INT.  ORACLE'S CHAMBERS (MATRIX) - DAY

	It looks like a suburban tract house.

	There is a lot of cozy furniture, a dining roon hutch
	filled with china, shelves and tables crowded with
	doilies, knick-knacks and ceramic brick-a-brack.

	Neo follows the plastic carpet runner to the kitchen.

	A WOMAN is huddled beside the oven, peering inside
	through the cracked door.

					NEO
			Hello?

					ORACLE (WOMAN)
			I know.  You're Neo.  Be right
			with you.

					NEO
			You're the Oracle?

					ORACLE
			Bingo.  I got to say I love seeing
			you non-believers.  It's really a
			relief.  All that pomp and
			circumstances just plain tucker me
			out.  Almost done.  Smell good,
			don't they?

					NEO
			Yeah.

					ORACLE
			I'd ask you to sit down, but
			you're not going to anyway.  And
			don't worry about the vase.

					NEO
			What vase?

	He turns to look around and his elbow knocks a VASE from
	the table.  It BREAKS against the linoleum floor.

					ORACLE
			The vase.

					NEO
			Shit, I'm sorry.

	She pulls out a tray of chocolate chip cookies and turns.
	She is an older woman, wearing big oven mitts,
	comfortable slacks and a print blouse.  She looks like
	someone's grandma.

					ORACLE
			I said don't worry about it.  I'll
			get one of my kids to fix it.

					NEO
			How did you know...?

	She sets the cookie tray on a wooden hot-pad.

					ORACLE
			What's really going to bake your
			noodle later on is, would you
			still have broken it if I hadn't
			said anything.

	Smiling, she lights a cigarette.

					ORACLE
			You're cuter than I thought.  I
			see why she likes you.

					NEO
			Who?

					ORACLE
			Not too bright, though.

	She winks.

					ORACLE
			You know why Morpheus brought you
			to see me?

					NEO
			I think so.

					ORACLE
			So? What do you think?  You think
			you're the one?

					NEO
			I don't know.

	She gestures to a wooden plaque, the kind every grandma
	has, except that the words are in Latin.

					ORACLE
			You know what that means?  It's
			Latin.  Means, 'Know thyself.'

	She puts her cigarette down.

					ORACLE
			Well, let's have a look at you.

	She widens his eyes, checks his ears, then feels the
	glands in his neck.

					ORACLE
			Open your mouth.  Say, 'ahhh.'

	She nods then looks at his palms.

					ORACLE
			Hmmm.  You sure got the gift, but
			it's tricky.  I'd say the bad news
			is, you're not the one.  Still got
			a lot to learn.  Maybe next life.

					NEO
			What's the good news?

					ORACLE
			Same as the bad news, you're not
			the one.

					NEO
			Is that it, then?

					ORACLE
			No.  Here.

	She picks up the tray of cooling cookies.

					ORACLE
			You better take a cookie.  Got a
			big day ahead of you.

	He eyes her, then takes a cookie.

					ORACLE
			Make a believer out of you yet.


	INT.  ANTECHAMBER (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus rises from a bench as the Priestess escorts Neo
	out.  When they are alone, Morpheus puts his hand on
	Neo's shoulder.

					MORPHEUS
			You don't have to tell me
			anything, Neo, because I already
			know what she said.

					NEO
			You do?

					MORPHEUS
			I brought you so that you could
			hear it for yourself.  I knew it
			would help.

	Neo finishes his cookie.

					MORPHEUS
			No one will ever ask you because
			it is a gift from her.  It is for
			you and you alone.


	EXT.  CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Storm clouds shroud the streets as the sky turns

	Cypher nervously glances down the surrounding streets.
	He notices several unmarked white vans.

	He mops the sweat from his forehead, when Trinity sees
	the black Lincoln.

			Here they come.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	In the hovercraft, we see the sweat rolling down Cypher's

	INT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Light filters down the throat of the building through a
	caged skylight at the top of the open elevator shaft.
	Four figures glide up the dark stairs that wind around
	the antique elevator.

	Neo notices a black cat, a yellow-green-eyed shadow that
	slinks past them and pads quickly down the stairs.

	A moment later, Neo sees another black cat that looks and
	moves identically to the first one.

					NEO
			Whoa.  Deja vu.

	Those words stop the others dead in their tracks.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	The monitors suddenly glitch as though the Matrix had an
	electronic seizure.

					TANK
			Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!


	INT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Trinity turns around, her face tight.

					TRINITY
			What did you just say?

					NEO
			Nothing.  Just had a little deja
			vu.

					TRINITY
			What happened?  What did you see?

					NEO
			A black cat went past us and then
			I saw another that looked just
			like it.

					TRINITY
			How much like it?  Was it the same
			cat?

					NEO
			It might have been.  I'm not sure.

	Trinity looks at Morpheus, who listens quietly to the
	rasping breath of the old building.

					NEO
			What is it?

					TRINITY
			A deja vu is usually a glitch in
			the Matrix.  It happens when they
			change something.

	She also listens as the staccato BEAT of HELICOPTER
	BLADES GROW ominously LOUDER.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank sees what was changed.

					TANK
			It's a trap!


	INT.  STAIRCASE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus looks up the stairs as a helicopter shadow
	passes over the clouded glass.

					MORPHEUS
			Come on!


	INT.  ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Cable goes to the draped windows.

					CABLE
			Did you just feel something weird?

					MOUSE
			Yeah...

	The CELLULAR RINGS.


	INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

	Heavy bolt-cutters snap through the main phone cable.


	INT.  ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Mouse answers the phone.

					MOUSE
			What's going on?

					TANK (V.O.)
			They cut the hard-line!  It's a
			trap!  Get out!

	Cable yanks open the curtain.

					CABLE
			Oh, no.

	The windows are bricked up.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	The door to the roof explodes open as heavily-armed rnen
	rush towards room 1313.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank watches helplessly.

					TANK
			No, no, no.


	INT.  ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY

	The door slams open and the police force pours in, dozens
	of assault rifles surrounding Mouse and Cable who are
	armed with only handguns.

					CABLE
			Morpheus!  It's a trap --


	INT.  STAIRS (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus stops as the scream is drowned by the REPORT of
	MACHINE GUNS filling the building with a terrible fury.

					TRINITY
			Oh, God.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Mouse's body thrashes against its harness as --


	INT.  ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY

	BULLETS POUND him against the blood-splattered brick
	window.  Gun smoke thickens the room, Cable blasting and
	moving until --

	The HAMMER CLICKS empty.  He screams as a DOZEN GUNS OPEN
	FIRE, ripping him apart.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Blood spits from Cable's mouth, his body spasming, then
	lying perfectly still.

	The flat-line ALARM softly cries out from the life
	MONITORS of the two dead men.


	EXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	More police cars arrive as cops break open the lobby
	doors.


	INT.  STAIRWELL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Flying downstairs, Morpheus stops, hearing the police
	swarming below.  He turns and rushes down the hall of the
	eighth floor.  At the end of it, he finds the bricked-up
	windows.

					CYPHER
			That's what they changed.  We're
			trapped.  There's no way out.

	The sound of heavy BOOT-STEPS close around them with the
	mechanical sureness of a vice.

					MORPHEUS
			Give me your phone.

					TRINITY
			They'll be able to track it.

					MORPHEUS
			We have no choice.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank answers the call.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Tank, find a structural drawing of
			this building and find it fast.

	His fingers pound the keyboard.


	INT.  LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Flashlights probe the rotting darkness as the police
	search every floor.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	The diagram windows onto the screen.

					TANK
			Got it.

					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I need the main wet-wall.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith pauses, his hand going to his earpiece.


	INT.  ROOM 808 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus is guided by Tank.

					TANK (V.O.)
			Now left and that's it in front of
			you.

					MORPHEUS
			Good.

	He cuts off the phone.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith hears the LINE CLICK dead.

					AGENT SMITH
			Eighth floor.  They're on the
			eighth floor.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Brown hears Smith on his earphone.

					AGENT BROWTJ
			Eighth floor!  Move!


	INT.  STAIRWELL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Cops flood the eighth floor, rushing everywhere.


	INT.  ROOM 808 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Several cops sweep through the room.  It is empty.  As
	they pass the bathroom, we see a man-sized hole smashed
	through the plaster and lathe.


	INT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	They are inside the main plumbing wall, slowly worming
	their way down the greasy, black stack pipes.

	Above them, light fills the hole they made to get inside.

	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Brown turns to Smith.

					AGENT BROWN
			Where are they?


	INT.  ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY

	The cops search in silence, straining for a clue, when
	one hears SOMETHING STRANGE near the bathroom.


	INT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Cypher has slipped and is wedged between the wall and
	several thick supply pipes.


	INT.  ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY

	The Cop leans in, his ear almost against the thin
	membrane of plaster separating them.  He can hear
	WHISPERS, HISSES and a GRUNT when --

	The WALL suddenly bulges, SHATTER-CRACKING as the Cop
	realizes --

					COP
			They're in the walls!


	INT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo pulls Cypher free just as the Cop OPENS FIRE --

	BULLETS PUNCHING shafts of light like swords into the box
	of soot-black space.


	INT.  ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY

	The Cop keeps FIRING, his flashlight strapped to his gun
	barrel, lighting up the wall until --

	A BULLET spits out his forehead.  Agent Smith watches the
	BODY fall with a THUD.

					AGENT SMITH
			Are orders that hard to follow?
			I'll say it again.  Morpheus must
			be taken alive.  Understand?


	INT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	They're almost falling, they're climbing so fast.

	Above them, plaster is smashed open as crunbling bits
	shower down on them, filling the crawlway with dust.


	INT.  ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith looks into the open wall, at the exposed
	intestines of the building, and realizes where they are
	going.

					AGENT SMITH
			How like a rodent.


	INT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Just below, a RIFLE-BUTT SMASHES open the WALL, light
	raking across the lathe.

					COP
			I got him!  I got him!

	Trinity finds her gun first.  BULLET-HOLES POP out the
	WALL as she STRAFES the room, sending cops diving for
	cover.

	They continue, Trinity exposed for a roment, when a
	creeping cop smashes a fist through and grabs a fistful
	of her hair.

	He starts to yank her out when Neo kicks, his boot
	bursting through plaster and splintering lathe, knocking
	the Cop out.

	They then quickly sink out of sight.


	INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

	This part of the basement, a dark concrete cavern, was
	the main mechanical room.  There are four enormous
	boilers, dinosaur-like technology that once pumped hot
	water like arteries.

	Black and bloody, they squeeze out from the ceiling into
	the tangled web of pipes.

	Their enemies are waiting for them.

	Blinding lights cut open the darkness as gas-masked
	figures FIRE GRENADE LAUNCHERS.

	Smoke blossoms from the green-metal canisters.

	Morpheus never stops moving.  Searching the floor, he
	finds what.he needs; the cover of the catch basin.

	Cypher watches him pry open the grate, when a gas can
	bounces near him.

					MORPHEUS
			Come on!

	Cypher seems to trip as the cloud envelops him.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Cypher's body begins to shiver uncontrollably.

					TANK
			Nerve gas.


	INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus watches Cypher disappear into the smoke then
	follows the others down the wet-black hole.


	INT.  CATCH BASIN (MATRIX) - DAY

	They crawl through greasy black water in a three foot
	diameter pipe that feeds into the sewer main.


	INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

	Gas-masked apparitions find the open hole.


	EXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Cypher is carried out, hand-cuffed, his body still
	shaking, mucus bubbling out his nose.  As he is led past
	Agent Smith, it almost seems that both men smile.

					AGENT SMITH
			We have them now.


	INT.  SEWER MAIN (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo punches out the screen and then spills down into the
	main water trough.

	Oily water forms around them as they wade across the man-
	made underground river, towards the service catwalk.

	Neo is about to pull himself out when he sees them coming.

	Flashlights and laser sites sweep at them as cops in
	helmets and heavy armor, looking more nachine than human,
	fill both ends of the tunnel.

	There is a single manhole cover above them.

	Morpheus whispers to Trinity.

					MORPHEUS
			You have to get Neo out.
			Understand?  That's all that
			matters now.

					TRINITY
			Morpheus, don't --

					MORPHEUS
			He must get out.  Do you
			understand me?

	She nods.

	A font of water erupts as Morpheus leaps for the manhole
	ladder, his coat flying open like the wings of a manta
	ray.

					COPS
			There he is!  That's him!

	Pools of light wash over him as he hauls himself to the
	surface.

					COP
			He's heading for the street!

	Trinity urges the others to follow her.  Grabbing Neo,
	they wade quietly away from the chaos.


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus shoots out of the sewer but the police are
	waiting for him.  The closest cop is armed with a
	tranquilized gun.  He fires --

	But Morpheus' is too fast, using the manhole cover as a
	shield, blocking the darts, then --

	Frisbee-ing it into the cop's armored chest, knocking him
	off his feet.

	The cops lunge at him but every part of his body is a
	deadly weapon moving with impossible speed.

	It seems he might fight his way out when he throws a
	spinning back fist that is caught by --

	Agent Smith.

					AGENT SMITH
			So, we meet at last.

					MORPHEUS
			And you are?

					AGENT SMITH
			Smith.  I am Agent Smith.

					MORPHEUS
			You all look the same to me.

					AGENT SMITH
			I've been waiting for this noment.

	Faster than a snake spits, Morpheus cracks Smith with a
	jaw-breaking right.

				MORPHEUS
			Oh, so have I.

	Agent Smith smiles.


	INT.  SEWER MAIN (MATRIX) - DAY

	Trinity leads the others, fading into the darkness of the
	tunnel, lit only with shafts of lights streaming through
	the street drains as we RISE TOWARDS them --

	THROUGH a grate INTO the fight.


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Smith and Morpheus exchange a furious serious of blows
	that is witnessed but not believed by the surrounding
	police.

	Agent Smith delivers a punishing kick that staggers
	Morpheus.

					AGENT SMITH
			You can't win.

	Morpheus smiles.

					MORPHEUS
			I already have.

	He stands up and drops his fists; a steely resolve in his
	eyes.

					AGENT SMITH
			Take him.

	Cops swarm over Morpheus.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank reaches out to the screen as if reaching for
	Morpheus.

					TANK
			No!


	EXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Cuff ed and beaten, Morpheus is thrown into a caged
	transport vehicle.  The DOOR CLANGS shut.

	Agent Jones finds Agent Smith.

					AGENT JONES
			The others were lost.

					AGENT SMITH
			You've taken care of Reagan?

	Agent Jones nods.

					AGENT SMITH
			Then the others do not matter.


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	A manhole cover cracks open.  Two eyes peek out just as a
	TRUCK RATTLES over it.  The THUNDER DOPPLERS AWAY and the
	cover opens.

	Neo, Trinity, Switch and Apoc climb out.  Trinity pulls a
	water-logged phone from her pocket.

					TRINITY
			We need a phone.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank is again at the monitors, searching the Matrix.

			We gotta find the others.  They're

	The PHONE RINGS.

			Operator.

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			I need an exit!  Fast!

					TANK
			Cypher?  I thought they had you?


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Cypher is standing at a public phone.  Across the street
	is the burning paddy wagon that appears to have collided
	witli an oncoming car.

					CYPHER
			There was an accident.  A fucking
			car accident.  All of a sudden.
			Boom.  They're all dead.  I still
			got the shakes but, Jesus,
			someone's going to make a believer
			out of me.

			Just get me outta here.


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

			Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie.
			An old appliance store.

	Cypher hangs up and smiles as the fire trucks arrive.

			An actor.  Definitely.

	They are outside a pawn shop.  Trinity has a new cellular.

			We need an exit!

					TANK (V.O.)
			Gotcha.  You're not far from
			Cypher.

					TRINITY
			Cypher, I thought --

					TANK (V.O.)
			So did we.  That boy's got nine
			lives.  I sent him to Franklin and
			Erie.

					TRINITY
			Got it.

	She hangs up.


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Running, Cypher turns onto Erie.


	INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Dead machines, eviscerated and shrouded with dust lay on
	metal shelves like bodies in a morgue.

	Plywood covering a small window is ripped off and Cypher
	crawls inside.

	Deep in the back room, a PHONE that has not rung in years
	begins to RING.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank punches the emit command.

					TANK
			Got him.

	Cypher's body twitches in its harness, jerking itself
	awake.  His eyes blink open.  Dozer unplugs him.

					DOZER
			System check looks fine.

	Cypher stands, a raspy cough spewing from his lungs.


	EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Trinity sees the appliance shop.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Cypher holds his chest.

			You okay?

					CYPHER
			Goddamn gas.  My lungs are killing
			me.

	He crosses to an overhead bin.

					CYPHER
			We got any pain killers?

					DOZER
			The first aid kit's over here.

	As Dozer stoops for a cabinet, Cypher pulls back a heavy
	blanket exposing a plasma rifle.


	INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo crawls through the window that Cypher opened.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank finishes loading the exit programs as Cypher rises
	behind him, swinging the weapon at his back.

	He looks over as Dozer turns with the first aid kit, a
	look of frozen disbelief crossing his face --

					DOZER
			No!

	Tank spins as red hot wads of PLASMA EXPLODE through his
	chair and into his back.  Diving, a second BURST tears up
	his side --

	As Dozer shoots a look at the monitor where Tank was
	working.  He stabs the enter command activating the exit
	sequence and ducks under a BARRAGE of PLASMA FIRE-


	INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

	The PHONE begins to RING as the others crawl in.

			God, I love that sound.

	Dozer rolls up, grabbing a heavy crowbar from a box of
	tools.

	Cypher circles the drive chairs as the sights of the
	plasma rifle find Dozer's face.

	Dozer charges, screaming, and the PLASMA RIFLE SCREAMS
	back.


	INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

	The PHONE is still RINGING.

					TRINITY
			You first,.Neo.

	Neo answers the phone when there is a CLICK.  There is no
	signal.  Nothing but silence.

					TRINITY
			What happened?

					NEO
			I don't know.  It just went dead.

	Trinity listens to the dead line and takes out the
	cellular.


	INT. MAIN DECK

	The operator PHONE begins to RING- Cypher steps over the
	body of Tank and looks at the monitor.


	INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Trinity can almost feel him watching them.  Every
	unanswered RING wrings her gut a little tighter, until --

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Hello, Trinity.

					TRINITY
			Cypher?  Where's Tank?

					CYPHER (V.O.)
			He had an accident.

					TRINITY
			An accident?  What about Dozer?
			Is Dozer there?


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	He walks over to Trinity's body, staring down at it
	hanging in its coma-like stillness.

					CYPHER
			You know, for a long time, I
			thought I was in love with you,
			Trinity.  I used to dream about
			you...

	He nuzzles his face against hers, feeling the softness of
	it.

					CYPHER
			You are a beautiful woman.  Too
			bad things had to work out like
			this.

	We INTERCUT BETWEEN the appliance store and the main
	deck.

					TRINITY
			You killed them.

					APOC
			What?!

					SWITCH
			Oh God.

	Wearing Tank's operator headgear, Cypher moves among the
	silent bodies.

					CYPHER
			In a way you're very lucky.  Most
			people never know why they die.
			One minute they're alive, the next
			they're dead.  No warning.
			Nothing.  That's why I thought
			maybe I should tell you.  It
			seemed the least I could do.

	He stands over the body of Morpheus, as his anger boils
	up out of him.

					CYPHER
			You see, the truth, the real,truth
			is that the war is over.  It's
			been over for a long time.  And
			guess what?  We lost!  Did you
			hear that?  We lost the war!

					TRINITY
			What about Zion?

					CYPHER
			Zion?  Zion is a part of this
			delusion.  More of this madness.
			That's why this has to be done.
			It has to end.  Now and forever.

	She suddenly sees the entire dark plan.

					TRINITY
			Oh rny God.  This is abzut Zion.
			You gave them Morpheus for the
			access codes to Zion.

	Cypher walks away from Morpheus and bends down next to
	Apoc's body.

					CYPHER
			You see, Trinity, we humans have a
			place in the future.  But it's not
			here.  It's in the Matrix.

					TRINITY
			The Matrix isn't real!

					CYPHER
			Oh, I disagree, Trinity.  I
			disagree.  I think the Matrix is
			more real than this world.  I
			mean, all I do is pull a plug
			here.  But there, you watch a man
			die.

	He grabs hold of the cable in Apoc's neck, twists it and
	yanks it out.

					CYPHER
			You tell me which is more real.

	Apoc seems to go blind for an instant, a scream caught in
	his throat, his hands reaching for nothing, and then
	falls dead.  Switch screams.

					CYPHER
			Welcome to the real world, right?

	He laughs.

					TRINITY
			Somehow, some way, you're going to
			pay for this.

					CYPHER
			Pay for it?  I'm not even going to
			remember it.  It'll be like it
			never happened.  The tree falling
			in the forest.  It doesn't make a
			sound.

	His hand slides around the neck of Switch as he takes
	hold of her plug.

	She suddenly feels her body severed from her mind as she
	is murdered.

					TRINITY
			Goddamn you, Cypher!

					CYPHER
			Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just
			the messenger.  And right now I'm
			going to prove that the message is
			true.

	He stands over Neo.

					CYPHER
			If Morpheus was right, then
			there's no way I can pull this
			plug, is there?

	She turns to Neo, eyes wide with fear, and he knows he is
	next.

					CYPHER
			If he is the One, then in the next
			few seconds there has to be some
			kind of miracle to stop me.
			Because if he dies like the others
			that means Morpheus was wrong.
			How can he be the One if he's
			dead?

	He takes hold of the cord when --

	She hears an EXPLOSION and a scream.

	Cypher is on the ground, his left leg blown off at the
	knee.  He rolls over and finds Tank on the ground, and
	the sights of the plasma rifle.

					TANK
			How's it feel, Cypher?  Knowing
			you're about to die?

					NEO
			It's Tank!  He's alive.

	Cypher lunges for Neo's plug just as Tank BLOWS his head
	off.


	INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

	They're both listening, trying to figure out what is
	happening when the store PHONE starts to RING.

	Trinity smiles, tears moistening her eyes as Neo throws
	his arms around her.  For a moment, it looks as if they
	might kiss before Trinity lets go.

					TRINITY
			We should, we should hurry.

					NEO
			Yeah.  Right.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Trinity's eyes open, a sense of relief surging through
	her at the sight of the ship.  As Tank unplugs her, she
	sees his charred wounds.

					TRINITY
			Tank, you're hurt.

					TANK
			I'll be all right.

					TRINITY
			Dozer?

	Tank's face tightens.

					TRINITY
			I'm sorry, Tank.


	EXT.  NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY

	A Japanese luxury hotel in downtown Chicago.

	A military helicopter sets down on the roof.  Heavily
	armed Marines begin to deploy.

	Agent Jones gets out of the helicopter, flanked by
	columns of Marines.  They open the roof access door
	and enter the top-floor maintenance level of the hotel.


	INT.  TOP FLOOR (MATRIX) - DAY

	They get in the elevator.  At every door, at least two
	Marines stop and post guard.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	They exit the elevator and walk to the Presidential
	suite; the final two Marines post guard.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Inside, he finds Agent Smith.

					AGENT JONES
			There is a problem.  Reagan has
			failed to secure the hardware.

	Agent Smith stares out the window.

					AGENT SMITH
			Never send a human to do a
			machine's job.

					AGENT JONES
			But if Reagan has failed, why
			haven't they pulled the plug?

					AGENT SMITH
			Haven't you learned by now, that
			it is impossible to understand why
			they do the things they do?

	He turns.

					AGENT SMITH
			Continue as planned.  Trace his
			signal to locate their position
			and deploy an extermination unit.

	Morpheus is handcuffed to a chair, stripped to the waist.
	He is bleeding from numerous wounds and is pumped full of
	serum, alternately shivering and sweating.  He is hooked
	up to various monitors with white disk electrodes.

	Agent Brown begins running a trace program.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Neo looks at Morpheus whose body is covered with a cold
	sweat.

					NEO
			What are they doing to him?

					TANK
			They're cracking his mind.

					NEO
			How?

					TANK
			They inject virus-like serums to
			break down the system.  It's like
			cracking a computer.  All it takes
			is time.

					NEO
			How much time?

					TANK
			Depends on the mind.  But
			eventually, it will crack and his
			alpha pattern will change from
			this to this.

	Tank punches several commands on Morpheus' personal unit.
	The monitor waves change from a chaotic pattern to an
	orderly symmetrical one.

					TANK
			When it does, Morpheus will tell
			them anything they want to know.

					NEO
			The access codes to Zion.

					TANK
			If an agent got inside Zion's
			mainframe he could do anything.
			Disable the defense system. It
			would be the end of us.

	He looks up at Trinity who is pacing relentlessly.

					TANK
			We can't let that happen.  We have
			to do it, Trinity.  Zion has to be
			protected.

	Trinity sees Cypher's dead body.  Rage overtakes her and
	she starts kicking hin.

					TRINITY
			Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!

					TANK
			We have to pull the plug.

					TRINITY
			No!

					TANK
			We don't have any other choice.

	Those words are like using gasoline to put out a fire and
	we watch the pain in her eyes burn into a blaze.  She
	walks past him and gets into her chair.

					TANK
			Trinity, what are you doing?

					TRINITY
			I'm going in after him.

					TANK
			Morpheus could conform at any
			minute --

					TRINITY
			If he does I'm sure you'll do what
			has to be done.

					TANK
			You saw that place.  It's suicide.

	She glares at him.

					TANK
			I know what Morpheus means to
			you --

					TRINITY
			No.  No, I don't think you do.  If
			you did, then you would know that
			I'm not letting him go.  Not
			without a fight, Tank.

	She yanks her harness tight.

					TRINITY
			Not without a fight.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith stands in the bedroon of the enormous suite,
	staring out the windows at the city, below, shimmering
	with brilliant sunlight.

					AGENT SMITH
			Have you ever stood and stared at
			it, Morpheus?  Marveled at its
			beauty.  Its genius.  Billions of
			people just living out their 
			lives... oblivious.

	Agent Brown sucks a serum from a glass vial, filling a
	hypodermic needle.

					AGENT SMITH
			Did you know that the first Matrix
			was designed to be a perfect human
			world?  Where none suffered, where
			everyone would be happy.  It was a
			disaster.  No one would accept the
			program.  Entire crops were lost.

	Agent Brown jams the needle into Morpheus' shoulder, and
	plunges down.

					AGENT SMITH
			Some believed we lacked the
			programming language to describe
			your perfect world.  But I believe
			that, as a species, human beings
			define their reality through
			suffering and misery.

	Agent Brown studies the screens as the life signs react
	violently to the injection.

					AGENT SMITH
			The perfect world was a dream that
			your primitive cerebrum kept
			trying to wake up from.  Which is
			why the Matrix was re-designed to
			this:  the peak of your
			civilization.

	He turns from the window.

					AGENT SMITH
			I say 'your civilization' because
			as soon as we start thinking for
			you, it really becomes our
			civilization, which is, of course,
			what this is all about.

	He sits down directly in front of Morpheus.

					AGENT SMITH
			Evolution, Morpheus.  Evolution.

	He lifts Morpheus' head.

					AGENT SMITH
			Like the dinosaur.  Look out that
			window.  You had your time.

	Morpheus stares hard at him, trying hard not to show the
	pain racking his mind.

					AGENT SMITH
			The future is our world, Morpheus.
			The future is our time.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Neo goes to his chair and begins strapping in.

					TRINITY
			What do you think you're doing?

					NEO
			You need help.  I'm coming with
			you.

					TRINITY
			No.  No way.  Morpheus sacrificed
			himself so you could escape.
			There's no way you're going back
			in.

					NEO
			Morpheus did what he did because
			he believed that I'm something
			that I'm not.

					TRINITY
			What?

					NEO
			I'm not the One, Trinity.  The
			Oracle told me.

	Trinity is stunned.

					NEO
			She said I had a gift but I still
			had a lot to learn.  She told me
			maybe next life.

					TRINITY
			Did you tell Morpheus?

					NEO
			Why?  It wouldn't mean anything.
			He'd still believe what he wanted
			to believe.  But Morpheus is the
			one that matters.  He's more
			important than me and we both know
			it.

	He straps in.

					NEO
			I may not be what Morpheus thinks
			I am, but if I don't try to help
			him, then I'm not even what I
			think I am.

					TRINITY
			What are you?

					NEO
			His friend.

	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith sits casually across from Morpheus who is
	hunched over, his body leaking and twitching.

					AGENT SMITH
			I'd like to share a revelation
			that I've had during my time here.
			It came to me when I tried to
			classify your species.  I've
			realized that you are not actually
			mammals.

	The life signs continue their chaotic patterns.

					AGENT SMITH
			Every mammal on this planet
			instinctively develops a natural
			equilibrium with the surrounding
			environment.  But you humans do
			not.  You move to an area and you
			multiply and multiply until every
			natural resource is consumed and
			the only way you can survive is to
			spread to another area.

	He leans forward.

					AGENT SMITH
			There is another organism on this
			planet that follows the same
			pattern.  Do you know what it is?
			A virus.

	He smiles.

					AGENT SMITH
			Human beings are a disease, a
			cancer of this planet.  You are a
			plague.  And we are... the cure.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Trinity and Neo hang motionless in the suspension unit.
	Tank is at the operations station.

					TANK
			Okay.  Store's open.  What do you
			need?

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			Guns.  Lots of guns.

					TANK
			Coming right up.

	He loads the weapons disk.


	INT.  CONSTRUCT

	Racks of weapons appear and Neo and Trinity arm
	themselves.

					TRINITY
			No one has ever done anything like
			this.

					NEO
			Yeah?

	He snap cocks an Uzi.

					NEO
			That's why it's going to work.

	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith is again at the window.

					AGENT SMITH
			Why isn't the serum working?

					AGENT BROWN
			Perhaps we are asking the wrong
			questions.

					AGENT JONES
			Or he doesn't know.

					AGENT SMITH
			Of course he knows.  He's
			resisting.

					AGENT BROWN
			How?

					AGENT SMITH
			I don't know.  If I knew...

	Agent Smith hides his knotting fist.  He is becoming
	angry.  It is something that isn't supposed to happen to
	agents.

					AGENT SMITH
			Leave me with him.

	Agent Brown and Jones look at each other.

					AGENT SMITH
			Now!

	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank sits down beside Morpheus whose face is ashen like
	someone near death.  He takes hold of his hand.

			Hold on, Morpheus.  They're coming

	EXT.  NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY

	A dark wind blows.


	INT.  NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY

	In long, black coats, Trinity and Neo push through the
	revolving doors.

	Neo is carrying a duffel bag.  Trinity has a large metal
	suitcase.  They cut across the lobby drawing nervous
	glances.

	Dark glasses, game faces.

	Several plainclothes cops try to stop them.  They are met
	by the MUTED SPIT of a SILENCED GUN and the RAZORED
	WHISTLE of THROWING STARS.

	The cops slump down to the marbled floor while Neo and
	Trinity do not even break stride.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith leans close to Morpheus, whispering to him.

					AGENT SMITH
			Can you hear me, Morpheus?  I'm
			going to be honest with you.

	He removes his earphone, letting it dangle over his
	shoulder.

					AGENT SMITH
			I hate this place.  This zoo.
			This prison.  This reality,
			whatever you want to call it, I
			can't stand it any longer.  It's
			the smell, if there is such a
			thing.  I feel saturated by it.  I
			can taste your stink and every
			time I do, I fear that I've
			somehow been infected by it.

	He wipes sweat from Morpheus' forehead, coating the tips
	of his fingers, holding them to Morpheus' nose.

					AGENT SMITH
			Repulsive, isn't it?

	He lifts Morpheus' head, holding it tightly with both
	hands.

					AGENT SMITH
			I must get out of here, I must get
			free.  In this mind is tlie key.
			My key.

	Morpheus sneers through his pain.

					AGENT SMITH
			Once Zion is gone, there's no
			need for me to be here.  Do you
			understand?  I need the codes.  I
			have to get inside Zion.  You have
			to tell me how.

	He begins squeezing, his fingers gouging into his flesh.

					AGENT SMITH
			Tell me!  Tell me!

	The skull is about to shatter when Agents Jones and Brown
	burst into the room.  Agent Smith releases Morpheus.

					AGENT BROWN
			What were you doing?

	Agent Smith recovers, replacing his ear piece.

					AGENT JONES
			You don't know.

					AGENT SMITH
			Know what?

	Agent Smith listens to his earphone, not believing what
	he is hearing.


	INT.  ELEVATORS (MATRIX) - DAY

	They get in.  Trinity immediately drops and opens the
	suitcase, wiring a plastique and napalm bomb.

	Beneath their trench coats is an arsenal of weapons slung
	from climbing harnesses.

	Neo hits the emergency stop.  He pulls down part of the
	false ceiling and finds the elevator shaft access panel.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Jones looks at Morpheus.

					AGENT JONES
			I think they're trying to save
			him.


	INT.  ELEVATOR SHAFT (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo ratchets down a clamp onto the elevator cable.  Both
	of them lock on.  He looks up the long, dark throat of
	the building and takes a deep breath.

					NEO
			There is no spoon.

	Neo whips out his gun and presses it to the cable, lower
	than where they attached themselves.

	BOOM!  The CABLE SNAPS.

	The counter-weights plummet, yanking Trinity and Neo up
	through the shaft as --

	The elevator falls away beneath them, distending space,
	filling it with the sound of WHISTLING METAL as they soar
	to the top.


	INT.  LOBBY (MATRIX) - DAY

	The ELEVATOR hits the botton.

	BA-BOOM!

	The massive EXPLOSION blows open the doors, fire clouds
	engulfing the elevator section of the lobby.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	The Agents hear the BLAST AND FIRE ALARMS.

					AGENT JONES
			Lower level --

					AGENT BROWN
			They are actually attacking.


	INT.  ELEVATOR SHAFT (MATRIX) - DAY

	Hanging by a rope, Trinity hot-wires the panel for the
	door.


	INT.  TOP FLOOR (MATRIX) - DAY

	Nervous, the Marines watch as the ELEVATOR "DINGS" softly
	and slides open.

	Black smoke rises out of the exposed shaft.

	The nearest Marine eases to the edge, peering down at the
	churning blaze engulfing the lower levels.

	He does not see Trinity and Neo above him until it is too
	late.

	Krack!  Neo kicks, knocking the Marine flying down into
	the shaft.

	Before the others can react, Trinity flips out into the
	hall, decking the nearest Marine.  Neo cracks another.

	The fight is over before it begins.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	An enormous EXPLOSION THUNDERS above them, shaking the
	building.  The ALARM SOUNDS, emergency sprinklers begin
	showering the room.

	Agent Smith smashes a table.

					AGENT SMITH
			Find them and destroy them!

	Agent Jones nods and touches his ear piece.


	EXT.  ROOF (MATRIX) - DAY

	The roof-access tower is now engulfed in flames as Neo
	and Trinity lay waste to a dozen more Marines.

	Guns and knives, like extensions of their bodies used
	with the same deadly precision as their feet and their
	fists.

	Across the roof, the pilot inside the army helicopter
	watches the ferocious onslaught.

					PILOT
			I repeat, we are under attack!

	Suddenly his face, his whole body dissolves, consumed by
	spreading locust-like swarm, of STATIC as --

	Agent Jones emerges.

	Just as she drops the last Marine, Trinity sees what's
	coming.

	Neo sees her, the fear in her face, and he knows what is
	behind him.

	Screaming, he whirls, GUNS filling his hands with
	thought-speed.

	Fingers PUMPING, SHELLS ejecting, dancing up and away, we
	look through the sights and gun smoke at --

	The Agent blurred with motion --

	Until the HAMMERS CLICK against empty metal.

					NEO
			Trinity!

	Agent Jones charges.

					NEO
			... help.

	His GUN BOOMS as we enter the liquid space of --

	Bullet-time.

	The AIR SIZZLES with wads of lead-like angry flies as Neo
	twists, bends, ducks just between them.

	Agent Jones still running, narrows the gap, the BULLETS
	coming faster until --

	Neo bent impossibly back, one hand on the ground as a
	spiraling gray ball shears open his shoulder.

	He starts to scream as another digs a red groove across
	his thigh.

	He has only time to look up, to see the barrel when Agent
	Jones, standing over him, pulls the TRIGGER the final
	time.

	CLICK.  Empty.

	Neo rolls, reaching for another gun when around-house
	kick snaps his jaw.  Agent Jones grabs the gun and levels
	it at Neo.

					AGENT JONES
			Only human...

	Suddenly Agent Jones stops.  Something is wrong.  He
	scans the roof.  Trinity is gone.

	Immediately, he whirls around and turns straight into the
	muzzle of her .45 --

	Jammed right into his head.

					TRINITY
			Dodge this, motherfucker!

	BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  The body flies back with a flash of
	mercurial light and when it hits the ground --

	It is the pilot.

	Trinity helps Neo up.

					NEO
			Thanks.

					TRINITY
			You're hit --

					NEO
			I'm fine.

	Neo is already looking at the helicopter.

					NEO
			Can you fly that thing?

					TRINITY
			Not yet.

	She pulls out a cellular phone.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Tank is back at the controls.

					TANK
			Operator.

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			Tank, I need a pilot program for a

	Tank is immediately searching the disk drawers.

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			Hurry!

	His fingers flash over the gleaming laser disks, finding
	one that he feeds into Trinityls supplement drive,
	punching the "load" cormands on her keyboard.


	EXT.  ROOF (MATRIX) - DAY

	Trinity's eyes flutter as information surges into her
	brain, all the essentials of flying a helicopter absorbed
	at light-speed.

					TRINITY
			Let's go.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Marines, trying to communicate with the men on the roof,
	are beginning to panic when Agent Jones comes around the
	corner.

					SERGEANT
			Sir!  Sir!  There was gunfire --
			we've lost communication with the
			roof!

					AGENT JONES
			Remain at your posts.

					SERGEANT
			But, sir -- the fire -- we should
			evacuate!

					AGENT JONES
			You will do as you are ordered!

					SERGEANT
			Yes, sir.

	Agent Jones marches into the Presidential Suite.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Jones throws open the bedroom door and enters,
	walking through the puddles pooling in the carpet.

	Over the RUSHING WATER and the ALARMS, Agent Smith hears
	a SOUND and understands the seriousness of the attack.

	He turns to the wall of windows as the helicopter drops
	INTO VIEW --

	Neo is in the back bay, aiming the mounted .50 machine
	gun.

					AGENT SMITH
			No.

	The GUN jumps and BULLETS EXPLODE through the WINDOW in a
	cacophony of CRASHING GLASS --

	As the Agents go for their weapons.

	But Neo is too close, the .50 CALIBER too fast and
	BULLETS are everywhere, perforating the room.

	Agent Smith is hit first, his body jack-knifing back,
	blood arcing out with a sudden flash of light --

	Then Agent Brown, his GUN still FIRING as his body falls.

	And finally Agent Jones.

	Neo stares at Morpheus, trying to will him into action.

					NEO
			Get up, Morpheus!  Get up!

	Morpheus sits unmoving, his head still down.

	Neo grabs the climbing rope just as marines burst into
	the adjoining room.

	He attaches only one end to his harness when they OPEN
	FIRE.

	Quickly he swings the GUN, SPRAYING the other room,
	WINDOWS SHATTERING, FURNITURE EXPLODING, marines diving
	for cover.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Just outside the Presidential Suite, three marines
	blister with snow-static.


	INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

	Morpheus lifts his face into the room's rain.  His eyes,
	still white, begin to blink, twitch, then close.

	And when he opens them, they are again dark and flashing
	with fire.

	The Agents knife into the room, FIRING even as Neo's
	BULLET TRAILS chase them.

	Morpheus strains at his handcuffs.

	The Agents and the marines turn the tide, BLASTING LEAD,
	RICOCHETING, POCK-MARKING the COPTER.

	FIRING wildly, Neo turns to see Morpheus rising, snapping
	the handcuffs, starting for the window.

	Agent Smith stops and sees Morpheus run past the open
	bedroom door.

					AGENT SMITH
			Nooo!

	He FIRES, sweeping across the sheetrocked wall in a
	perfect line.

	For an instant, we see the BULLETS SHRED, PUNCTURING the
	WALL, searing through the wet air with jet trails of
	chalk.

	And as Morpheus starts to dive for the window, a bullet
	buries itself in his leg --

	Knocking him off balance.

					NEO
			He won't make it.

	Morpheus lunges, out of control --

	As Neo spins, every move a whip crack --

	Snapping the other rope-end onto a bolted bar.

	Morpheus begins to fall when Neo hurls himself into the
	wide blue empty space --

	Flying for a moment.

	The rope snaking out behind him; an umbilical cord
	attached to a machine.

	As their two bodies, set in motion, rushing at each other
	on a seemingly magnetic course until --

	They collide.

	Almost bouncing free of each other, arms, legs,
	scrambling, hands searching in furious desperation,
	finding hold and clinging.

	Until the line ends, snapping taut, cracking their
	fragile embrace.  Morpheus tumbles, legs flipping over,
	falling down --

	The ground deliriously distant --

	As Neo snatches hold of his mentor's still handcuffed
	wrist.

					NEO
			Gotcha!

	Trinity is already pulling the copter up and away.

	As Agent Smith grabs the M-16 from the nearest marine.

	He'll bring them all down.  Targeting the helicopter, he
	aims at something only he can see: the oil line.

	PONK.  PONK.  PONK.  The rear HULL is PUNCHED full of
	holes and smoke and oil pours out like black blood.

					TRINITY
			Shit-shit-no!

	Neo is pulling Morpheus up to him when he hears the
	HELICOPTER BEGIN TO DIE.

					NEO
			Oh fuck.

	Trinity throws the helicopter towards the roof of the
	nearest building.

	Morpheus and Neo cling to one another as they and the
	machine above them begin to fall.

	The ENGINE GRINDS, the CHOPPING BLADES start to slow
	while --

	The Agents stand in the open shattered window, watching
	the helicopter disappear behind taller buildings.

	Carried by its nomentum, Trinity guides the parabolic
	fall over the nearest roof where --

	Neo and Morpheus drop safely, rolling free as the rope
	goes slack.  Neo gets to his feet, trying to detach
	himself but --

	The helicopter is falling too fast, arcing over the roof
	like a setting sun --

	The coils of slack snap taught --

	Yanking Neo off his feet, dragging him with ferocious
	speed towards the edge even as --

	Trinity lunges for the back door, her gun in one hand,
	grabbing for the rope with the other --

	Neo flies like a skipping stone, hurtling straight AT us,
	when his feet hit the rain gutter --

	A fulcrum that levers him up just as --

	Trinity FIRES, severing the cord from the HELICOPTER,
	falling free of it as it SMASHES, blades first into a 
	glass skyscraper.

	Holding onto the rope she swings, connected to Neo, who
	stands on the building's edge watching her arc beneath
	him as the HELICOPTER EXPLODES --

	She bounces against a shatterproof window that spider-
	cracks out while FLAMES ERUPT behind her.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	Tank stares at the screen, his mouth agape.

					TANK
			He's the One.  He's got to be...


	EXT.  ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo pulls Trinity up into his arms.  Both shaking, they
	hold each other again.

					MORPHEUS
			I knew it!  I goddamn knew it!

					TRINITY
			Morpheus!

	She runs at him, throwing her arms around him.

					MORPHEUS
			Do you believe me now?  He's the
			One!  Who else could have done
			this?

					NEO
			Morpheus, I know you won't believe
			me but the Oracle told ne I'm not
			the One.

					MORPHEUS
			It doesn't matter if I don't
			believe you --

	His eyes light up.

					MORPHEUS
			What matters is that you don't
			believe her.


	INT.  MAIN DECK

	The PHONE RINGS.

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			Tank, get us out of here.

					TANK
			Got one ready.  An underground El
			station.  State and Balbo.

					TRINITY (V.O.)
			See ya soon.

	LINE GOES DEAD.  Tank looks at the bodies and smiles.

					TANK
			See ya soon.


	EXT.  ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY

	The rope is all that remains.  Agent Smith can barely
	control his anger.

					AGENT BROWN
			The trace was completed.

					AGENT JONES
			We have their position.

					AGENT BROWN
			The extermination unit is in
			place.

					AGENT JONES
			Order the strike.

	Agent Smith can't stand listening to them.  He moves to
	the edge of the building, looking out at the surrounding
	city.

					AGENT SMITH
			They're not out yet.


	INT.  "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY

	A metal gate is locked, the sign reading, "Station
	Closed."  Neo looks around, takes out a GUN and BLOWS OFF
	the LOCK.

	In the moist underground distance they hear the MUTED
	RING of a TELEPHONE.

	The PHONE is RINGING inside a graffiti-covered booth.

	Across from it, sitting hunched against the red concrete
	wall, is an OLD MAN.  He stares at the RINGING PHONE,
	taking a final pull off his T-bird.  No one is around.
	It continues to RING.

	Determined, he stands and walks to the booth.  He is
	about to answer the phone, when Neo sees him.

					NEO
			Don't!

	The Old Man stops, Neo rushes at hin, gliding smoothly
	over the turnstiles.

					OLD MAN
			I'm sorry -- I didn't mean!

	The Old Man is shaking, terrified.  Neo looks at his gun.
	He glances over his shoulder, then eases back the hammer.

					NEO
			Get outta here.  Okay?  Run!  Go!

	The Old Man nods, turns and hurries deeper into the urban
	cave, disappearing into the shadows as Trinity and
	Morpheus arrive.

					TRINITY
			What happened?  Was that --

					NEO
			It was nobody.

	Neo turns to the RINGING BOOTH.

					NEO
			Let's go!  You first, Morpheus.

	Morpheus gets in and answers the phone.

	Lost in the shadow, the Old Man turns back and watches as
	Morpheus disappears, the phone dropping, dangling by its
	cord.

	His eyes grow wide, glowing white in the dark.


	EXT.  ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith stares, his face twisted with hate.  He will
	never be free of the Matrix.

	He starts to turn from the edge of the building when he
	suddenly hears it, his head whipping back around,
	staring --


	INT.  "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY

	As the Old Man stares.

	Trinity hangs up the phone.  She turns to Neo, standing
	close enough to kiss him.

					TRINITY
			Morpheus is right, you know.  It
			doesn't matter what he believes or
			even what the Oracle believes.
			What matters is what you believe.

					NEO
			I believe...

	He stares at the fullness of her lips.

					NEO
			I want to kiss you.

	She smiles.

					TRINITY
			I want to kiss you too...

	The PHONE begins to RING.

					TRINITY
			But I want it to be real.

	She pulls herself away and gets into the booth when
	something catches Neo's eye and he looks to where the Old
	Man had been.

	She hears him SCREAM and sees Agent Smith emerge as if
	formed by congealing darkness, charging with a fistful of
	metal.

	The GUN FIRES, the BULLET flying at her, BURSTING through
	the plastic WINDOW just as --

	Trinity disappears.

	The handset hanging in the air as the BULLET HITS,
	SHATTERING the EAR-PIECE.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Trinity blinks, shivering as her conscious exits the
	Construct.

					TRINITY
			Neo!

					TANK
			What the hell just happened?

					TRINITY
			An Agent!  You have to send me
			back!

					TANK
			I can't!


	INT.  "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY

	GUN REPORT THUNDERS through the underground, both men
	BLASTING, moving at impossible speed.

	For a blinking noment we enter BULLET-TIME.

	Gun flash tongues curl from Neols gun, bullets float
	forward like a plane noving across the sky, cartridges
	cartwheel into space.

	An instant later they are nearly on top of each other,
	rolling up out of a move that is almost a mirrored
	reflection of the other --

	Each jamming their gun tight to the other's head.

	They freeze in a kind of embrace; Neo sweating, panting,
	Agent Smith machine-calm.

	Agent Smith smiles.

					AGENT SMITH
			You're empty.

	Neo pulls the TRIGGER.  CLICK.

					NEO
			So are you.

	The smile falls.  Agent Smith yanks his TRIGGER.

	CLICK.

	Agent Smith's face warps with rage and he attacks, fist
	flying at furious speed, blows and counters, Neo
	retreating as --

	A knife-hand opens his forearm, and a kick sends him
	slamming back against a steel column.

	Stunned, he ducks just under a punch that crunches into
	the beam, STEEL CHUNKS EXPLODING like shrapnel.

	Behind him, Neo leaps into the air, delivering a neck-
	snapping reverse round-house.  Agent Smith's glasses fly
	off and he glares at Neo; his eyes, ice blue.

					AGENT SMITH
			You can't win.

					NEO
			I already have.

	He attacks with a vicious series of blows but the Agent
	seems to absorb them, waiting for his opening.

	And this time Agent Smith's attack is too much, an
	unrelenting fury, fists pounding like jackhammers.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Trinity watches Neo as his body jerks, mouth coughing
	blood, his life signs going wild.

					TRINITY
			Jesus, he's killing him!


	INT.  "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Smith grabs hold of him, lifting him into the air,
	hurling him against the curved wall of the train tunnel,
	where he falls inches from the electrified third-rail.

	The Agent is about to jump down, and press his attack
	when he hears sonething.  From deep in the tunnel, like
	an animal cry; a burst of high-speed METAL GRINDING
	against METAL.

	The sound of an ON-COMING TRAIN.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Tank is trying to find another entrance.

					TRINITY
			Send me back, Tank!  Anywhere!

					TANK
			I'm looking, Trinity!  I'm
			looking!

	From the cockpit, an ALARM sounds.  Morpheus hurries to
	the front console, typing, bringing up the radar.

	Trinity follows him.

					TRINITY
			What is it... oh no.

	In every pipe surrounding them, they see the
	Extermination Unit.

					TRINITY
			Sentinels.


	INT.  SEWER MAIN

	The killing machine we saw in the History Program blister
	by us like tracer bullets shot down the throat of the
	abyss.


	INT.  "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo tries to get up.  Agent Smith jumps down onto the
	tracks and drop-kicks him in the face.

	The world begins to shake, RUMBLING as the TRAIN NEARS.

					AGENT SMITH
			Do you hear that, Mr. Anderson?

	Agent Smith grabs Neo in a choke-hold, forcing him to
	look down the tracks, the train's headlight burning a
	hole in the darkness.

					AGENT SMITH
			That is the sound of
			inevitability.

	Neo sees it coming and he starts to fight.

					AGENT SMITH
			It is the sound of your death.

	There is another METAL SCREECH, MUCH LOUDER, closer, as
	Agent Smith tightens his hold.  Neo is unable to breathe.

					AGENT SMITH
			Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

	The TRAIN ROARS at them, swallowing Agent Smith's words.

	The veins bulge in Neo's head, as he grits through the
	pain.

	He is not ready to die.

					NEO
			My name is Neo.

	Impossibly, he hurls himself straight up, smashing Smith
	against the concrete ceiling of the tunnel.

	They fall as the sound and fury of the TRAIN EXPLODES
	INTO the station.

	Neo back-flips up off the tracks just as --

	The train barrels over Agent Smith.

	Neo stands, knees shaking, when the train slams on its
	emergency brake.  With an ear-splitting SHRIEK of
	TORTURED RAILS, the train slows, part of it still in the
	station.

	Neo turns, limping, starting to run, racing for the
	escalator --

	As the train comes to a stop and the doors of the last
	car open; Agent Smith bursts out in furious pursuit, his
	glasses again intact.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Morpheus checks the ship's self destruct key.

					TRINITY
			You can't use that until Neo is
			out!

					MORPHEUS
			I know.  Don't worry, he'll make
			it.


	EXT.  CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	A man sits in his Mercedes, talking on his car phone when
	his door is thrown open.  Neo yanks him out and jumps in.

	Further down the street, Agent Smith slows, calmly
	touching his ear-piece.

	Neo throws the car across traffic, rocketing down a side-
	street.


	INT.  CAR (MATRIX) - DAY

	Driving like a demon with one hand, he grabs the car
	phone and dials long distance.

	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Tank answers.

					TANK
			Operator.

					NEO (V.O.)
			Mr. Wizard, Get me the fuck out
			of here!


	INT.  CAR (MATRIX) - DAY

	Looking over his shoulder, watching the mirrors, Neo
	drives almost unconsciously.

					NEO
			Hurry, Tank!  I got some serious
			pursuit!


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	The keyboard clicking, Tank searches for an exit.
	Trinity screams into the headset.

					TRINITY
			Neo, you better get your ass back
			here!


	INT.  CAR

					NEO
			I'm trying, Trinity.  I'm trying.

					TANK (V.O.)
			I got one!

	Neo glances to his right and sees Agent Brown, now
	driving the car beside his.  Agent Brown swerves,
	slamming into him.

					TANK (V.O.)
			Wabash and Lake.  A hotel.

	Neo fights the steering wheel as Agent Brown pushes the
	car up over the median.

					TANK (V.O.)
			Room 303.

	Neo drops the phone as his car bucks into the opposing
	lane --

	Directly into the charging path of an enormous truck
	driven by Agent Smith.

	Neo dives from the Mercedes as the truck plows into it,
	rending metal and GLASS, crushing through, totaling other
	cars, as it EXPLODES.

	Neo is up and running even as orange and black clouds
	billow up behind hin.


	EXT.  CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

	Three figures silhouette by the burning wreckage become
	the three agents.

	Further down the street, Neo hauls his broken, bleeding
	ass.

	Agents Brown and Smith slow, touching their ear-pieces as
	Agent Jones continues chasing full-bore.

	Neo spins around a corner, racing toward a hotel called:
	the Heart of Chicago Hotel.

	Only Agent Jones is behind him now.

	Neo dives into the alley.  At the far end he sees Agent
	Brown charging.  Neo leaps for the fire escape and begins
	to climb.


	INT.  SEWER MAIN

	Sentinels open and shift like killer kaleidoscopes as
	they ready their weapons, swarming around the
	Nebuchadnezzar.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	The hovercraft booms as machines drop onto it.

					TANK
			I'm going to make the call.

					MORPHEUS
			Do it!


	INT.  "HEART OF CHICAGO" HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Agent Snith is in the elevator when he hears the DISTANT
	RING of a PHONE.


	EXT.  ALLEY (MATRIX) - DAY

	The agents chase him, FIRING, BULLETS SPARKING and
	RICOCHETING even as Neo jumps for the third-floor
	platform.

	Neo kicks in the window, jumping into the hall.  The
	doors count backwards:  310...  309...


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Morpheus grabs the biggest gun he can find.  The lasers
	begin to slice through the hull.

					TRINITY
			Where is he?

					TANK
			Almost there.

					MORPHEUS
			He's going to make it.

					TRINITY
			Hurry, Neo.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo can hear the PHONE RINGING.

	305...  304...

	Agent Brown reaches the broken window behind him just as
	Neo grabs the handle of 303, throwing open the door to
	find --

	Agent Sniith, waiting, .45 cocked.

	Neo can't move -- can't think --

	BOOM.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Neo's body jerks, and everyone hears it as the life
	monitors snap flat-line.

	Trinity screams.  Morpheus is frozen in disbelief.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Three holes in his chest, Neo falls to the blue shag
	carpeting, blood smearing down the wallpaper.

	Agent Smith stands over him, still aiming, taking no
	chances.

					AGENT SMITH
			Check him.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Through the lasered opening, Morpheus screams, blasting
	away at the machines; comet-wads of plasma burning holes
	in their armored housings.

	Trinity collapses onto Neo's body.

					TRINITY
			No-no-no!  Neo, you're not dead!
			You can't be dead!


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Kneeling beside him, Agent Brown checks his vital signs.

					AGENT BROWN
			He's gone.

	Agent Smith smiles, standing over him.

					AGENT SMITH
			I told you, you couldn't win.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Tank is hit, a laser bolt knocking him to the ground.
	They can't hold them off any longer.  Morpheus lunges for
	the self destruct --

	As Trinity whispers in Neo's ear.

					TRINITY
			You're right here.  I'm holding 
			you, Neo.  I'm not letting you go.
			Do you hear me?  I won't let you
			go.


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	The agents walk to the elevator, leaving Neo's body
	behind.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Morpheus flicks the Plexiglas shield of the self-
	destruct.

					TRINITY
			Goddamnit, Neo!  Don't give it up!
			Not now!

	She pounds on his chest.

					TRINITY
			Not now!


	INT.  HOTEL HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	The BLOW ECHOES deep in his mind.

	His eyes snap open.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Trinity screams as the monitors jump back to life.  Tank
	and Morpheus stare, unbelieving.

	It is a miracle.

					TRINITY
			Now get up!


	INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo struggles, holding his chest, sitting up.  Down the
	hall, he sees the elevator closing and --

	Agent Smith staring at him as if he were looking at a
	Cypher.

	Neo gives him the finger.

					AGENT SMITH
			Nooooo!

	Agent Smith pounds on the elevator door.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	A sentinel BLOWS a hole in Morpheus' right arm and he
	screams, refusing to let go of the detonator.

	INT.  ROOM 303 (MATRIX) - DAY

	Neo dives for the RINGING PHONE.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	Machines split open the craft, pouring in, lasers
	targeting everywhere.

	A beat finds the center of Morpheus' forehead and he
	screams, ready to die.

					TRINITY
			Now!

	He turns the key.


	INT.  OVERFLOW PIT

	A blinding shock of white lights flood the chamber;
	sentinels blink and fall instantly dead, filling the pit
	with their cold, metal carcasses.


	INT.  HOVERCRAFT

	In the still darkness, only the humans are alive.

					TRINITY
			Neo?

	His eyes open.  Tears pour from her smiling eyes as he
	reaches up to touch her.

	And she kisses hin; it seems like it might last forever.

									FADE TO BLACK.


	FADE IN:

	ON COMPUTER SCREEN

	as in the opening.  The cursor beating steadily, waiting.

	A PHONE begins to RING.

	It is answered and the screen fills instantly with the
	trace program.  After a long beat, we recognize Neo's
	voice.

					NEO (V.O.)
			Hi.  It's me.  I know you're out
			there.  I know you're working as
			fast as you can to catch me.

	We CLOSE IN ON the racing columns of numbers shimmering
	across the screen.

					NEO (V.O.)
			I thought I should call and let
			you know how things stand.

	We DIVE THROUGH the numbers, surging UP THROUGH the
	darkness, sucked TOWARDS a tight constellation of stars.

					NEO (V.O.)
			I know you're real proud of this
			world you've built, the way it
			works, all the nice little rules
			and such, but I've got some bad
			news.

	We realize that the constellation is actually the holes
	in the mouthpiece of a phone.  Seen from inside.

					NEO (V.O.)
			I've decided to make a few
			changes.

	We SHOOT THROUGH the holes as Neo hangs up the phone.

	He steps out of the phone booth and starts walking,
	wearing a long black coat and dark glasses.  He passes a
	mother dragging her little BOY, who cranes his neck as --

	Neo takes off, flying up into the air.

					BOY
			Mommy!  Mommy!

					MOMMY
			What?

					BOY
			That man!  That man flies!

					MOMMY
			Don't be silly, honey.  Men don't
			fly.

	There is a RUSH of AIR as the Boy stares up as Neo shoots
	overhead.  His coat billowing like a black leather cape
	as he soars up, up, and away.

										FADE OUT.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP � MORNING

               A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles. 
               It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed, 
               there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching 
               on bacon and eating eggs.

               Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The 
               Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and, 
               like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're 
               going out of style.

               It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or 
               how old she is; everything she does contradicts something 
               she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is 
               to be said in a rapid pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm 
                         through doin' that shit.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         You always say that, the same thing 
                         every time: never again, I'm through, 
                         too dangerous.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I know that's what I always say. I'm 
                         always right too, but �

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         � but you forget about it in a day 
                         or two -

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         � yeah, well, the days of me 
                         forgittin' are over, and the days of 
                         me rememberin' have just begun.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         When you go on like this, you know 
                         what you sound like?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I sound like a sensible fucking man, 
                         is what I sound like.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         You sound like a duck.
                              (imitates a duck)
                         Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, 
                         quack, quack...

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Well take heart, 'cause you're never 
                         gonna hafta hear it again. Because 
                         since I'm never gonna do it again, 
                         you're never gonna hafta hear me 
                         quack about how I'm never gonna do 
                         it again.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         After tonight.

               The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in 
               there, back and forth.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                              (with a smile)
                         Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

               A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Can I get anybody anymore coffee?

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Oh yes, thank you.

               The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man 
               lights up another cigarette.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I'm doin' fine.

               The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his 
               smoke.

               The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her 
               coffee.

               The Young Man goes right back into it.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I mean the way it is now, you're 
                         takin' the same fuckin' risk as when 
                         you rob a bank. You take more of a 
                         risk. Banks are easier!  Federal 
                         banks aren't supposed to stop you 
                         anyway, during a robbery. They're 
                         insured, why should they care? You 
                         don't even need a gun in a federal 
                         bank. I heard about this guy, walked 
                         into a federal bank with a portable 
                         phone, handed the phone to the teller, 
                         the guy on the other end of the phone 
                         said: "We got this guy's little girl, 
                         and if you don't give him all your 
                         money, we're gonna kill 'er."

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Did it work?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm 
                         talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in 
                         a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, 
                         not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, 
                         cleans the place out, and they don't 
                         lift a fuckin' finger.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Did they hurt the little girl?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I don't know. There probably never 
                         was a little girl � the point of the 
                         story isn't the little girl. The 
                         point of the story is they robbed 
                         the bank with a telephone.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         You wanna rob banks?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, 
                         I'm just illustrating that if we 
                         did, it would be easier than what we 
                         been doin'.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         So you don't want to be a bank robber?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Naw, all those guys are goin' down 
                         the same road, either dead or servin' 
                         twenty.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         And no more liquor stores?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         What have we been talking about? 
                         Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides, 
                         it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too 
                         many foreigners own liquor stores. 
                         Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't 
                         fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em: 
                         "Empty out the register," and they 
                         don't know what it fuckin' means. 
                         They make it too personal. We keep 
                         on, one of those gook motherfuckers' 
                         gonna make us kill 'em.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         I'm not gonna kill anybody.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I don't wanna kill anybody either. 
                         But they'll probably put us in a 
                         situation where it's us of them. And 
                         if it's not the gooks, it these old 
                         Jews who've owned the store for 
                         fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got 
                         Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the 
                         counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try 
                         walkin' into one of those stores 
                         with nothin' but a telephone, see 
                         how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget 
                         it, we're out of it.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Well, what else is there, day jobs?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                              (laughing)
                         Not this life.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Well what then?

               He calls to the Waitress.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Garcon! Coffee!

               Then looks to his girl.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         This place.

               The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.

                                     WAITRESS
                              (snotty)
                         "Garcon" means boy.

               She splits.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Here? It's a coffee shop.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         What's wrong with that? People never 
                         rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor 
                         stores, gas stations, you get your 
                         head blown off stickin' up one of 
                         them. Restaurants, on the other hand, 
                         you catch with their pants down. 
                         They're not expecting to get robbed, 
                         or not as expecting.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                              (taking to idea)
                         I bet in places like this you could 
                         cut down on the hero factor.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Correct. Just like banks, these places 
                         are insured. The managers don't give 
                         a fuck, they're just tryin' to get 
                         ya out the door before you start 
                         pluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget 
                         it, they ain't takin' a bullet for 
                         the register. Busboys, some wetback 
                         gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour 
                         gonna really give a fuck you're 
                         stealin' from the owner. Customers 
                         are sittin' there with food in their 
                         mouths, they don't know what's goin' 
                         on. One minute they're havin' a Denver 
                         omelet, next minute somebody's 
                         stickin' a gun in their face.

               The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man 
               continues in a low voice.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         See, I got the idea last liquor store 
                         we stuck up. 'Member all those 
                         customers kept comin' in?

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Yeah.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Then you got the idea to take 
                         everybody's wallet.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Uh-huh.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         That was a good idea.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Thanks.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         We made more from the wallets then 
                         we did the register.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Yes we did.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         A lot of people go to restaurants.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         A lot of wallets.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Pretty smart, huh?

               The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new 
               information.

               She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The 
               tired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the 
               motions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the 
               COOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's 
               face.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Pretty smart.
                              (into it)
                         I'm ready, let's go, right here, 
                         right now.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Remember, same as before, you're 
                         crowd control, I handle the employees.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Got it.

               They both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on 
               the table. He looks at her and she back at him.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         I love you, Pumpkin.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         I love you, Honey Bunny.

               And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons, 
               stand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona 
               is that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is 
               that of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.

                                     PUMPKIN
                              (yelling to all)
                         Everybody be cool this is a robbery!

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Any of you fuckin' pricks move and 
                         I'll execute every one of you 
                         motherfuckers!  Got that?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS 
               down a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front

               wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long 
               green dusters. Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES 
               WINNFIELD (black). Jules is behind the wheel.

                                     JULES
                         � Okay now, tell me about the hash 
                         bars?

                                     VINCENT
                         What so you want to know?

                                     JULES
                         Well, hash is legal there, right?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a 
                         hundred percent legal. I mean you 
                         can't walk into a restaurant, roll a 
                         joint, and start puffin' away. You're 
                         only supposed to smoke in your home 
                         or certain designated places.

                                     JULES
                         Those are hash bars?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's 
                         legal to buy it, it's legal to own 
                         it and, if you're the proprietor of 
                         a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. 
                         It's legal to carry it, which doesn't 
                         really matter 'cause � get a load of 
                         this � if the cops stop you, it's 
                         illegal for this to search you. 
                         Searching you is a right that the 
                         cops in Amsterdam don't have.

                                     JULES
                         That did it, man � I'm fuckin' goin', 
                         that's all there is to it.

                                     VINCENT
                         You'll dig it the most. But you know 
                         what the funniest thing about Europe 
                         is?

                                     JULES
                         What?

                                     VINCENT
                         It's the little differences. A lotta 
                         the same shit we got here, they got 
                         there, but there they're a little 
                         different.

                                     JULES
                         Examples?

                                     VINCENT
                         Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer 
                         in a movie theatre. And I don't mean 
                         in a paper cup either. They give you 
                         a glass of beer, like in a bar. In 
                         Paris, you can buy beer at 
                         MacDonald's. Also, you know what 
                         they call a Quarter Pounder with 
                         Cheese in Paris?

                                     JULES
                         They don't call it a Quarter Pounder 
                         with Cheese?

                                     VINCENT
                         No, they got the metric system there, 
                         they wouldn't know what the fuck a 
                         Quarter Pounder is.

                                     JULES
                         What'd they call it?

                                     VINCENT
                         Royale with Cheese.

                                     JULES
                              (repeating)
                         Royale with Cheese. What'd they call 
                         a Big Mac?

                                     VINCENT
                         Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call 
                         it Le Big Mac.

                                     JULES
                         Le Big Mac. What do they call a 
                         Whopper?

                                     VINCENT
                         I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger 
                         King.  But you know what they put on 
                         french fries in Holland instead of 
                         ketchup?

                                     JULES
                         What?

                                     VINCENT
                         Mayonnaise.

                                     JULES
                         Goddamn!

                                     VINCENT
                         I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a 
                         little bit on the side of the plate, 
                         they fuckin' drown 'em in it.

                                     JULES
                         Uuccch!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHEVY (TRUNK) � MORNING

               The trunk of the Chevy OPENS UP, Jules and Vincent reach 
               inside, taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking 
               them.

                                     JULES
                         We should have shotguns for this 
                         kind of deal.

                                     VINCENT
                         How many up there?

                                     JULES
                         Three or four.

                                     VINCENT
                         Counting our guy?

                                     JULES
                         I'm not sure.

                                     VINCENT
                         So there could be five guys up there?

                                     JULES
                         It's possible.

                                     VINCENT
                         We should have fuckin' shotguns.

               They CLOSE the trunk.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD � MORNING

               Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically 
               dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what 
               looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building.

               We TRACK alongside.

                                     VINCENT
                         What's her name?

                                     JULES
                         Mia.

                                     VINCENT
                         How did Marsellus and her meet?

                                     JULES
                         I dunno, however people meet people. 
                         She usta be an actress.

                                     VINCENT
                         She ever do anything I woulda saw?

                                     JULES
                         I think her biggest deal was she 
                         starred in a pilot.

                                     VINCENT
                         What's a pilot?

                                     JULES
                         Well, you know the shows on TV?

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't watch TV.

                                     JULES
                         Yes, but you're aware that there's 
                         an invention called television, and 
                         on that invention they show shows?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah.

                                     JULES
                         Well, the way they pick the shows on 
                         TV is they make one show, and that 
                         show's called a pilot. And they show 
                         that one show to the people who pick 
                         the shows, and on the strength of 
                         that one show, they decide if they 
                         want to make more shows. Some get 
                         accepted and become TV programs, and 
                         some don't, and become nothing. She 
                         starred in one of the ones that became 
                         nothing.

               They enter the apartment building.

               INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING) � MORNING

               Vincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait 
               for the elevator.

                                     JULES
                         You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-
                         black, half-Samoan, usta call him 
                         Tony Rocky Horror.

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah maybe, fat right?

                                     JULES
                         I wouldn't go so far as to call the 
                         brother fat. He's got a weight 
                         problem.  What's the nigger gonna 
                         do, he's Samoan.

                                     VINCENT
                         I think I know who you mean, what 
                         about him?

                                     JULES
                         Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up 
                         good.  And word around the campfire, 
                         it was on account of Marsellus 
                         Wallace's wife.

               The elevator arrives, the men step inside.

               INT. ELEVATOR � MORNING

                                     VINCENT
                         What'd he do, fuck her?

                                     JULES
                         No no no no no no no, nothin' that 
                         bad.

                                     VINCENT
                         Well what then?

                                     JULES
                         He gave her a foot massage.

                                     VINCENT
                         A foot massage?

               Jules nods his head: "Yes."

                                     VINCENT
                         That's all?

               Jules nods his head: "Yes."

                                     VINCENT
                         What did Marsellus do?

                                     JULES
                         Sent a couple of guys over to his 
                         place.  They took him out on the 
                         patio of his apartment, threw his 
                         ass over the balcony.  Nigger fell 
                         four stories. They had this garden 
                         at the bottom, enclosed in glass, 
                         like one of them greenhouses � nigger 
                         fell through that. Since then, he's 
                         kinda developed a speech impediment.

               The elevator doors open, Jules and Vincent exit.

                                     VINCENT
                         That's a damn shame.

               INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY � MORNING

               STEADICAM in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline 
               down the hall.

                                     VINCENT
                         Still I hafta say, play with matches, 
                         ya get burned.

                                     JULES
                         Whaddya mean?

                                     VINCENT
                         You don't be givin' Marsellus 
                         Wallace's new bride a foot massage.

                                     JULES
                         You don't think he overreacted?

                                     VINCENT
                         Antwan probably didn't expect 
                         Marsellus to react like he did, but 
                         he had to expect a reaction.

                                     JULES
                         It was a foot massage, a foot massage 
                         is nothing, I give my mother a foot 
                         massage.

                                     VINCENT
                         It's laying hands on Marsellus 
                         Wallace's new wife in a familiar 
                         way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out 
                         � no, but you're in the same fuckin' 
                         ballpark.

               Jules stops Vincent.

                                     JULES
                         Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right 
                         there.  Eatin' a bitch out, and givin' 
                         a bitch a foot massage ain't even 
                         the same fuckin' thing.

                                     VINCENT
                         Not the same thing, the same ballpark.

                                     JULES
                         It ain't no ballpark either. Look 
                         maybe your method of massage differs 
                         from mine, but touchin' his lady's 
                         feet, and stickin' your tongue in 
                         her holyiest of holyies, ain't the 
                         same ballpark, ain't the same league, 
                         ain't even the same fuckin' sport.
                         Foot massages don't mean shit.

                                     VINCENT
                         Have you ever given a foot massage?

                                     JULES
                         Don't be tellin' me about foot 
                         massages � I'm the foot fuckin' 
                         master.

                                     VINCENT
                         Given a lot of 'em?

                                     JULES
                         Shit yeah. I got my technique down 
                         man, I don't tickle or nothin'.

                                     VINCENT
                         Have you ever given a guy a foot 
                         massage?

               Jules looks at him a long moment � he's been set up.

                                     JULES
                         Fuck you.

               He starts walking down the hall.  Vincent, smiling, walks a 
               little bit behind.

                                     VINCENT
                         How many?

                                     JULES
                         Fuck you.

                                     VINCENT
                         Would you give me a foot massage � 
                         I'm kinda tired.

                                     JULES
                         Man, you best back off, I'm gittin' 
                         pissed � this is the door.

               The two men stand in front of the door numbered "49." They 
               whisper.

                                     JULES
                         What time is it?

                                     VINCENT
                              (checking his watch)
                         Seven-twenty-two in the morning.

                                     JULES
                         It ain't quite time, let's hang back.

               They move a little away from the door, facing each other, 
               still whispering.

                                     JULES
                         Look, just because I wouldn't give 
                         no man a foot massage, don't make it 
                         right for Marsellus to throw Antwan 
                         off a building into a glass-
                         motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the 
                         way the nigger talks. That ain't 
                         right, man. Motherfucker do that to 
                         me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause 
                         I'd kill'a motherfucker.

                                     VINCENT
                         I'm not sayin' he was right, but 
                         you're sayin' a foot massage don't 
                         mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does. 
                         I've given a million ladies a million 
                         foot massages and they all meant 
                         somethin'. We act like they don't, 
                         but they do. That's what's so fuckin' 
                         cool about 'em. This sensual thing's 
                         goin' on that nobody's talkin about, 
                         but you know it and she knows it, 
                         fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan 
                         shoulda known fuckin' better. That's 
                         his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna 
                         have a sense of humor about that 
                         shit.

                                     JULES
                         That's an interesting point, but 
                         let's get into character.

                                     VINCENT
                         What's her name again?

                                     JULES
                         Mia. Why you so interested in big 
                         man's wife?

                                     VINCENT
                         Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida 
                         and when he's gone, he wants me to 
                         take care of Mia.

                                     JULES
                         Take care of her?

               Making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head.

                                     VINCENT
                         Not that! Take her out. Show her a 
                         good time. Don't let her get lonely.

                                     JULES
                         You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace 
                         out on a date?

                                     VINCENT
                         It ain't a date. It's like when you 
                         and your buddy's wife go to a movie 
                         or somethin'. It's just... you know... 
                         good company.

               Jules just looks at him.

                                     VINCENT
                         It's not a date.

               Jules just looks at him.

               INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) � MORNING

               THREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a 
               table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out.

               One of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to 
               REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway.

                                     JULES
                         Hey kids.

               The two men stroll inside.

               The three young caught-off-guard Guys are:

               MARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the 
               scene progresses, back into the corner.

               ROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a "Flock of 
               Seagulls" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the 
               table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand.

               BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.

               Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in 
               their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking.

                                     JULES
                         How you boys doin'?

               No answer.

                                     JULES
                              (to Brett)
                         Am I trippin', or did I just ask you 
                         a question.

                                     BRETT
                         We're doin' okay.

               As Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.

                                     JULES
                         Do you know who we are?

               Brett shakes his head: "No."

                                     JULES
                         We're associates of your business 
                         partner Marsellus Wallace, you 
                         remember your business partner 
                         dont'ya?

               No answer.

                                     JULES
                              (to Brett)
                         Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here: 
                         you're Brett, right?

                                     BRETT
                         I'm Brett.

                                     JULES
                         I thought so. Well, you remember 
                         your business partner Marsellus 
                         Wallace, dont'ya Brett?

                                     BRETT
                         I remember him.

                                     JULES
                         Good for you. Looks like me and 
                         Vincent caught you at breakfast, 
                         sorry 'bout that.  What'cha eatin'?

                                     BRETT
                         Hamburgers.

                                     JULES
                         Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any 
                         nutritious breakfast. What kinda 
                         hamburgers?

                                     BRETT
                         Cheeseburgers.

                                     JULES
                         No, I mean where did you get'em?
                         MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-
                         Box, where?

                                     BRETT
                         Big Kahuna Burger.

                                     JULES
                         Big Kahuna Burger. That's that 
                         Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they 
                         got some tasty burgers. I ain't never 
                         had one myself, how are they?

                                     BRETT
                         They're good.

                                     JULES
                         Mind if I try one of yours?

                                     BRETT
                         No.

                                     JULES
                         Yours is this one, right?

                                     BRETT
                         Yeah.

               Jules grabs the burger and take a bite of it.

                                     JULES
                         Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger.
                              (to Vincent)
                         Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna 
                         Burger?

                                     VINCENT
                         No.

               Jules holds out the Big Kahuna.

                                     JULES
                         You wanna bite, they're real good.

                                     VINCENT
                         I ain't hungry.

                                     JULES
                         Well, if you like hamburgers give 
                         'em a try sometime. Me, I can't 
                         usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's 
                         a vegetarian. Which more or less 
                         makes me a vegetarian, but I sure 
                         love the taste of a good burger.
                              (to Brett)
                         You know what they call a Quarter 
                         Pounder with Cheese in France?

                                     BRETT
                         No.

                                     JULES
                         Tell 'em, Vincent.

                                     VINCENT
                         Royale with Cheese.

                                     JULES
                         Royale with Cheese, you know why 
                         they call it that?

                                     BRETT
                         Because of the metric system?

                                     JULES
                         Check out the big brain on Brett. 
                         You'a smart motherfucker, that's 
                         right. The metric system.
                              (he points to a fast 
                              food drink cup)
                         What's in this?

                                     BRETT
                         Sprite.

                                     JULES
                         Sprite, good, mind if I have some of 
                         your tasty beverage to wash this 
                         down with?

                                     BRETT
                         Sure.

               Jules grabs the cup and takes a sip.

                                     JULES
                         Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot!
                              (to Roger)
                         You, Flock of Seagulls, you know 
                         what we're here for?

               Roger nods his head: "Yes."

                                     JULES
                         Then why don't you tell my boy here 
                         Vince, where you got the shit hid.

                                     MARVIN
                         It's under the be �

                                     JULES
                         � I don't remember askin' you a 
                         goddamn thing.
                              (to Roger)
                         You were sayin'?

                                     ROGER
                         It's under the bed.

               Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out 
               a black snap briefcase.

                                     VINCENT
                         Got it.

               Vincent flips the two locks, opening the case. We can't see 
               what's inside, but a small glow emits from the case. Vincent 
               just stares at it, transfixed.

                                     JULES
                         We happy?

               No answer from the transfixed Vincent.

                                     JULES
                         Vincent!

               Vincent looks up at Jules.

                                     JULES
                         We happy?

               Closing the case.

                                     VINCENT
                         We're happy.

                                     BRETT
                              (to Jules)
                         Look, what's your name? I got his 
                         name's Vincent, but what's yours?

                                     JULES
                         My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin' 
                         your ass outta this shit.

                                     BRETT
                         I just want you to know how sorry we 
                         are about how fucked up things got 
                         between us and Mr. Wallace. When we 
                         entered into this thing, we only had 
                         the best intentions �

               As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger 
               three times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair.

               Vince smiles to himself. Jules has got style.

               Brett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering, 
               but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.

                                     JULES
                              (to Brett)
                         Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your 
                         concentration? I didn't mean to do 
                         that.  Please, continue. I believe 
                         you were saying something about "best 
                         intentions."

               Brett can't say a word.

                                     JULES
                         Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through 
                         anyway.  Well, let me retort. Would 
                         you describe for me what Marsellus 
                         Wallace looks like?

               Brett still can't speak.

               Jules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing 
               the only barrier between himself and Brett. Brett now sits 
               in a lone chair before Jules like a political prisoner in 
               front of an interrogator.

                                     JULES
                         What country you from!

                                     BRETT
                              (petrified)
                         What?

                                     JULES
                         "What" ain't no country I know! Do 
                         they speak English in "What?"

                                     BRETT
                              (near heart attack)
                         What?

                                     JULES
                         English-motherfucker-can-you-speak-
                         it?

                                     BRETT
                         Yes.

                                     JULES
                         Then you understand what I'm sayin'?

                                     BRETT
                         Yes.

                                     JULES
                         Now describe what Marsellus Wallace 
                         looks like!

                                     BRETT
                              (out of fear)
                         What?

               Jules takes his .45 and PRESSES the barrel HARD in Brett's 
               cheek.

                                     JULES
                         Say "What" again! C'mon, say "What" 
                         again!  I dare ya, I double dare ya 
                         motherfucker, say "What" one more 
                         goddamn time!

               Brett is regressing on the spot.

                                     JULES
                         Now describe to me what Marsellus 
                         Wallace looks like!

               Brett does his best.

                                     BRETT
                         Well he's... he's... black �

                                     JULES
                         � go on!

                                     BRETT
                         ...and he's... he's... bald �

                                     JULES
                         � does he look like a bitch?!

                                     BRETT
                              (without thinking)
                         What?

               Jules' eyes go to Vincent, Vincent smirks, Jules rolls his 
               eyes and SHOOT Brett in the shoulder.

               Brett SCREAMS, breaking into a SHAKING/TREMBLING SPASM in 
               the chair.

                                     JULES
                         Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!

                                     BRETT
                              (in agony)
                         No.

                                     JULES
                         Then why did you try to fuck 'im 
                         like a bitch?!

                                     BRETT
                              (in spasm)
                         I didn't.

               Now in a lower voice.

                                     JULES
                         Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck 
                         'im.  You ever read the Bible, Brett?

                                     BRETT
                              (in spasm)
                         Yes.

                                     JULES
                         There's a passage I got memorized, 
                         seems appropriate for this situation: 
                         Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 
                         righteous man is beset on all sides 
                         by the inequities of the selfish and 
                         the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is 
                         he who, in the name of charity and 
                         good will, shepherds the weak through 
                         the valley of darkness, for he is 
                         truly his brother's keeper and the 
                         finder of lost children. And I will 
                         strike down upon thee with great 
                         vengeance and furious anger those 
                         who attempt to poison and destroy my 
                         brothers. And you will know my name 
                         is the Lord when I lay my vengeance 
                         upon you."

               The two men EMPTY their guns at the same time on the sitting 
               Brett.

               AGAINST BLACK, TITLE CARD:

                       "VINCENT VEGA AND MARSELLUS WALLACE'S WIFE"

               FADE IN:

               MEDIUM SHOT � BUTCH COOLIDGE

               We FADE UP on BUTCH COOLIDGE, a white, 26-year-old 
               prizefighter.  Butch sits at a table wearing a red and blue 
               high school athletic jacket. Talking to him OFF SCREEN is 
               everybody's boss MARSELLUS WALLACE. The black man sounds 
               like a cross between a gangster and a king.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         I think you're gonna find � when all 
                         this shit is over and done � I think 
                         you're gonna find yourself one smilin' 
                         motherfucker. Thing is Butch, right 
                         now you got ability. But painful as 
                         it may be, ability don't last. Now 
                         that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of 
                         life, but it's a fact of life your 
                         ass is gonna hafta git realistic 
                         about. This business is filled to 
                         the brim with unrealistic 
                         motherfuckers who thought their ass 
                         aged like wine.  Besides, even if 
                         you went all the way, what would you 
                         be? Feather-weight champion of the 
                         world. Who gives a shit? I doubt you 
                         can even get a credit card based on 
                         that.

               A hand lays an envelope full of money on the table in front 
               of Butch. Butch picks it up.

                         Now the night of the fight, you may 
                         fell a slight sting, that's pride

                         from now, when you're kickin' it in

                         "Marsellus Wallace was right."

                                     BUTCH
                         I got no problem with that.

                         In the fifth, your ass goes down.

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         Say it!

                                     BUTCH
                         In the fifth, my ass goes down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR (MOVING) � DAY

               Vincent Vega looks really cool behind the wheel of a 1964 
               cherry red Chevy Malibu convertible. From the car radio, 
               ROCKABILLY MUSIC PLAYS. The b.g. is a COLORFUL PROCESS SHOT.

               EXT. SALLY LEROY'S � DAY

               Sally LeRoy's is a large topless bar by LAX that Marsellus 
               owns.

               Vincent's classic Malibu WHIPS into the near empty parking 
               lot and parks next to a white Honda Civic.

               Vince knocks on the door. The front entrance is unlocked, 
               revealing the Dapper Dan fellow on the inside: ENGLISH DAVE. 
               Dave isn't really English, he's a young black man from Baldwin 
               Park, who has run a few clubs for Marsellus, including Sally 
               LeRoy's.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam, 
                         git your ass on in here.

               Vincent, carrying the black briefcase from the scene between 
               Vincent and Jules, steps inside. English Dave SLAMS the door 
               in our faces.

               INT. SALLY LEROY'S � DAY

               The spacious club is empty this time of day. English Dave 
               crosses to the bar, and Vince follows.

                                     VINCENT
                         Where's the big man?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         He's over there, finishing up some 
                         business.

               VINCENT'S POV: Butch shakes hands with a huge figure with 
               his back to us. The huge figure is the infamous and as of 
               yet still UNSEEN Marsellus.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
                         Hang back for a second or two, and 
                         when you see the white boy leave, go 
                         on over.  In the meanwhile, can I 
                         make you an espresso?

                                     VINCENT
                         How 'bout a cup of just plain lo' 
                         American?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia 
                         out tomorrow?

                                     VINCENT
                         At Marsellus' request.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Have you met Mia?

                                     VINCENT
                         Not yet.

               English Dave smiles to himself.

                                     VINCENT
                         What's so funny?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Not a goddamn thing.

                                     VINCENT
                         Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big 
                         man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit 
                         across a table, chew my food with my 
                         mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and 
                         that's all I'm gonna do.

               English Dave puts Vince's coffee in front of him.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         My name's Paul, and this is between 
                         y'all.

               Butch bellies up to the bar next to Vincent, drinking his 
               cup of "Plain ol' American."

                                     BUTCH
                              (to English Dave)
                         Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         Filters?

                                     BUTCH
                         Non.

               While Butch waits for his smokes, Vincent just sips his 
               coffee, staring at him. Butch looks over at him.

                                     BUTCH
                         Lookin' at somethin', friend?

                                     VINCENT
                         I ain't your friend, palooka.

               Butch does a slow turn toward Vincent.

                                     BUTCH
                         What was that?

                                     VINCENT
                         I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.

               Butch turns his body to Vincent, when...

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         Vincent Vega has entered the building, 
                         git your ass over here!

               Vincent walks forward OUT OF FRAME, never giving Butch another 
               glance. We DOLLY INTO CU on Butch, left alone in the FRAME, 
               looking like he's ready to go into the manners-teaching 
               business.

               BUTCH'S POV: Vincent hugging and kissing the obscured figure 
               that is Marsellus.

               Butch makes the wise decision that is this asshole's a friend 
               of Marsellus, he better let it go � for now.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
                         Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.

               Butch is snapped out of his ass-kicking thoughts. He pays 
               English Dave and walks out of the SHOT.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. LANCE'S HOUSE (KITCHEN) � NIGHT

               CLOSEUP � JODY

               A woman who appears to have a fondness for earrings. Both of 
               her ears are pierced five times. She also sports rings in 
               her lips, eyebrows and nose.

                                     JODY
                         ...I'll lend it to you. It's a great 
                         book on body piercing.

               Jody, Vincent and a young woman named TRUDI sit at the kitchen 
               table of a suburban house in Echo Park. Even though Vince is 
               at the same table, he's not included in the conversation.

                                     TRUDI
                         You know how they use that gun when 
                         they pierce your ears? They don't 
                         use that when they pierce your 
                         nipples, do they?

                                     JODY
                         Forget that gun. That gun goes against 
                         the entire idea behind piercing. All 
                         of my piercing, sixteen places on my 
                         body, every one of 'em done with a 
                         needle. Five in each ear. One through 
                         the nipple on my left breast. One 
                         through my right nostril.  One through 
                         my left eyebrow. One through my lip. 
                         One in my clit. And I wear a stud in 
                         my tongue.

               Vince has been letting this conversation go through one ear 
               and out the other, until that last remark.

                                     VINCENT
                              (interrupting)
                         Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm 
                         curious, why would you get a stud in 
                         your tongue?

               Jody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious 
               thing in the world.

                                     JODY
                         It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.

               That thought never occurred to Vincent, but he can't deny it 
               makes sense. Jody continues talking to Trudi, leaving Vincent 
               to ponder the truth of her statement.

                         Vince, you can come in now!

               INT. LANCE'S BEDROOM � NIGHT

               Lance, late 20s, is a young man with a wild and woolly 
               appearance that goes hand-in-hand with his wild and woolly 
               personality. LANCE has been selling drugs his entire adult 
               life. He's never had a day job, never filed a tax return and 
               has never been arrested. He wears a red flannel shirt over a 
               "Speed Racer" tee-shirt.

               Three bags of heroin lie on Lance's bed.

               Lance and Vincent stand at the foot of the bed.

                         Now this is Panda, from Mexico. Very 
                         good stuff. This is Bava, different, 
                         but equally good. And this is Choco 
                         from the Hartz Mountains of Germany. 
                         Now the first two are the same, forty-

                         ...this one's a little more expensive.  
                         It's fifty-five. But when you shoot 
                         it, you'll know where that extra 
                         money went.  Nothing wrong with the 
                         first two. It's real, real, real, 
                         good shit. But this one's a fuckin' 
                         madman.

                         dead as disco. Heroin's comin' back

                         they're as hot as hell.

               Vincent takes his works out of his case and, as the two 
               continue to talk, Vince shoots up.

               MIA, Marcellus' beautiful young wife. Video screens are in

               EXT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S � NIGHT

               In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over 
               L.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're 
               all basically the same. Decor out of an "Archie" comic book, 
               Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer, 
               saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the 
               Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and 
               over prices that pay for all this bullshit.

               But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's 
               diners.

               Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of 
               view.

               Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with 
               a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a 
               red windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath 
               the cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that 
               is the slogan: "Next best thing to a time machine."

                                     VINCENT
                         What the fuck is this place?

                                     MIA
                         This is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis 
                         man should love it.

                                     VINCENT
                         Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.

                                     MIA
                         You can get a steak here, daddy-o. 
                         Don't be a...

               Mia draws a square with her hands. Dotted lines appear on 
               the screen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.

                                     VINCENT
                         After you, kitty-cat.

               INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S � NIGHT

               Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint 
               English pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over 
               the wall

               ("ROCK ALL NIGHT," "HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL," "ATTACK OF 
               THE CRAB MONSTER," and "MACHINE GUN KELLY"). The booths that 
               the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s 
               cars.

               In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign 
               on the wall states, "No shoes allowed." Some wannabe beboppers 
               (actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or 
               barefeet.

               The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead, 
               B & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The 
               WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons: 
               MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and 
               LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing 
               appropriate costumes.

               Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red 
               '59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting 
               a big button on his chest that says: "Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing 
               you please me."

                                     BUDDY
                         Hi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?

                                     VINCENT
                         I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

                                     BUDDY
                         How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp, 
                         or bloody as hell?

                                     VINCENT
                         Bloody as hell. And to drink, a 
                         vanilla coke.

                                     BUDDY
                         How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?

                         I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger � 
                         bloody � and a five-dollar shake.

                                     BUDDY
                         How d'ya want that shake, Martin and 
                         Lewis, or Amos and Andy?

                         shake?

                                     MIA
                         Sure did.

                                     VINCENT
                         A shake? Milk and ice cream?

                                     MIA
                         Uh-huh.

                                     VINCENT
                         It costs five dollars?

                                     BUDDY
                         Yep.

                                     VINCENT
                         You don't put bourbon in it or 
                         anything?

                                     BUDDY
                         Nope.

                                     VINCENT
                         Just checking.

               Buddy exits.

               Vincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are 
               dancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers, 
               and the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing, 
               The Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her 
               customers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a 
               fool.

                                     MIA
                         Whaddya think?

                                     VINCENT
                         It's like a wax museum with a pulse 
                         rate.

               Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling 
               himself a smoke.

               After a second of watching him �

                         It's just tobacco.

                                     MIA
                         Oh. Well in that case, will you roll 
                         me one, cowboy?

               As he finishes licking it �

                                     VINCENT
                         You can have this one, cowgirl.

               He hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to 
               her lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's 
               hand. He lights it.

                                     MIA
                         Thanks.

                                     VINCENT
                         Think nothing of it.

               He begins rolling one for himself.

               As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner, 
               making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a 
               square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS 
               the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out 
               a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.

               Back to Mia and Vincent.

                                     MIA
                         Marsellus said you just got back 
                         from Amsterdam.

                                     VINCENT
                         Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.

                                     MIA
                         That was my fifteen minutes.

                                     VINCENT
                         What was it?

                                     MIA
                         It was show about a team of female 
                         secret agents called "Fox Force Five."

                                     VINCENT
                         What?

                                     MIA
                         "Fox Force Five." Fox, as in we're a 
                         bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in 
                         we're a force to be reckoned with. 
                         Five, as in there's one... two ... 
                         three... four... five of us. There 
                         was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal 
                         from that show "Baton Rouge," she 
                         was the leader. A Japanese one, a 
                         black one, a French one and a brunette 
                         one, me.  We all had special skills. 
                         Sommerset had a photographic memory, 
                         the Japanese fox was a kung fu master, 
                         the black girl was a demolition 
                         expert, the French fox' specialty 
                         was sex...

                                     VINCENT
                         What was your specialty?

                                     MIA
                         Knives. The character I played, Raven 
                         McCoy, her background was she was 
                         raised by circus performers. So she 
                         grew up doing a knife act. According 
                         to the show, she was the deadliest 
                         woman in the world with a knife. But 
                         because she grew up in a circus, she 
                         was also something of an acrobat. 
                         She could do illusions, she was a 
                         trapeze artist � when you're keeping 
                         the world safe from evil, you never 
                         know when being a trapeze artist's 
                         gonna come in handy. And she knew a 
                         zillion old jokes her grandfather, 
                         an old vaudevillian, taught her. If 
                         we woulda got picked up, they woulda 
                         worked in a gimmick where every 
                         episode I woulda told and ol joke.

                                     VINCENT
                         Do you remember any of the jokes?

                                     MIA
                         Well I only got the chance to say 
                         one, 'cause we only did one show.

                                     VINCENT
                         Tell me.

                                     MIA
                         No. It's really corny.

                                     VINCENT
                         C'mon, don't be that way.

                                     MIA
                         No. You won't like it and I'll be 
                         embarrassed.

                                     VINCENT
                         You told it in front of fifty million 
                         people and you can't tell it to me? 
                         I promise I won't laugh.

                                     MIA
                              (laughing)
                         That's what I'm afraid of.

                                     VINCENT
                         That's not what I meant and you know 
                         it.

                                     MIA
                         You're quite the silver tongue devil, 
                         aren't you?

                                     VINCENT
                         I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.

                                     MIA
                         That's not what you said Vince. Well 
                         now I'm definitely not gonna tell 
                         ya, 'cause it's been built up too 
                         much.

                                     VINCENT
                         What a gyp.

               Buddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around 
               the straw of her shake.

                                     MIA
                         Yummy!

                                     VINCENT
                         Can I have a sip of that? I'd like 
                         to know what a five-dollar shake 
                         tastes like.

                                     MIA
                         Be my guest.

               She slides the shake over to him.

                                     MIA
                         You can use my straw, I don't have 
                         kooties.

               Vincent smiles.

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, but maybe I do.

                                     MIA
                         Kooties I can handle.

               He takes a sip.

                                     VINCENT
                         Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin' 
                         good milk shake.

                                     MIA
                         Told ya.

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't know if it's worth five 
                         dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' 
                         good.

               He slides the shake back.

               Then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.

                                     MIA
                         Don't you hate that?

                                     VINCENT
                         What?

                                     MIA
                         Uncomfortable silences. Why do we 
                         feel it's necessary to yak about 
                         bullshit in order to be comfortable?

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't know.

                                     MIA
                         That's when you know you found 
                         somebody special. When you can just 
                         shit the fuck up for a minute, and 
                         comfortably share silence.

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't think we're there yet. But 
                         don't feel bad, we just met each 
                         other.

                                     MIA
                         Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to 
                         the bathroom and powder my nose, 
                         while you sit here and think of 
                         something to say.

                                     VINCENT
                         I'll do that.

               INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (LADIES ROOM) � NIGHT

               Mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the 
               bathroom sink. Her head jerks up from the rush.

                                     MIA
                              (imitating Steppenwolf)
                         I said goddamn!

               INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) � NIGHT

               Vincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak. As he chews, his 
               eyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant.

               Mia comes back to the table.

                                     MIA
                         Don't you love it when you go to the 
                         bathroom and you come back to find 
                         your food waiting for you?

                                     VINCENT
                         We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy 
                         Holly doesn't seem to be much of a 
                         waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn 
                         Monroe's section.

                                     MIA
                         Which one, there's two Marilyn 
                         Monroes.

                                     VINCENT
                         No there's not.

               Pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table.

                                     VINCENT
                         That's Marilyn Monroe...

               Then, pointing at a BLONDE WAITRESS in a tight sweater and 
               capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS �

                                     VINCENT
                         ... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I 
                         don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it 
                         must be her night off.

                                     MIA
                         Pretty smart.

                                     VINCENT
                         I have moments.

                                     MIA
                         Did ya think of something to say?

                                     VINCENT
                         Actually, there's something I've 
                         wanted to ask you about, but you 
                         seem like a nice person, and I didn't 
                         want to offend you.

                                     MIA
                         Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like 
                         mindless, boring, getting-to-know-
                         you chit-chat. This sounds like you 
                         actually have something to say.

                                     VINCENT
                         Only if you promise not to get 
                         offended.

                                     MIA
                         You can't promise something like 
                         that. I have no idea what you're 
                         gonna ask. You could ask me what 
                         you're gonna ask me, and my natural 
                         response could be to be offended. 
                         Then, through no fault of my own, I 
                         woulda broken my promise.

                                     VINCENT
                         Then let's just forget it.

                         That is an impossibility. Trying to 
                         forget anything as intriguing as 
                         this would be an exercise in futility.

                                     VINCENT
                         Is that a fact?

               Mia nods her head: "Yes."

                                     MIA
                         Besides, it's more exciting when you 
                         don't have permission.

                                     VINCENT
                         What do you think about what happened 
                         to Antwan?

                                     MIA
                         Who's Antwan?

                                     VINCENT
                         Tony Rocky Horror.

                                     MIA
                         He fell out of a window.

                                     VINCENT
                         That's one way to say it. Another 
                         way is, he was thrown out. Another 
                         was is, he was thrown out by 
                         Marsellus. And even another way is, 
                         he was thrown out of a window by 
                         Marsellus because of you.

                                     MIA
                         Is that a fact?

                                     VINCENT
                         No it's not, it's just what I heard.

                                     MIA
                         Who told you this?

                                     VINCENT
                         They.

               Mia and Vincent smile.

                                     MIA
                         They talk a lot, don't they?

                                     VINCENT
                         They certainly do.

                                     MIA
                         Well don't by shy Vincent, what 
                         exactly did they say?

               Vincent is slow to answer.

                                     MIA
                         Let me help you Bashful, did it 
                         involve the F-word?

                                     VINCENT
                         No. They just said Rocky Horror gave 
                         you a foot massage.

                                     MIA
                         And...?

                                     VINCENT
                         No and, that's it.

                                     MIA
                         You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror 
                         out of a four-story window because 
                         he massaged my feet?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah.

                                     MIA
                         And you believed that?

                                     VINCENT
                         At the time I was told, it seemed 
                         reasonable.

                                     MIA
                         Marsellus throwing Tony out of a 
                         four story window for giving me a 
                         foot massage seemed reasonable?

                                     VINCENT
                         No, it seemed excessive. But that 
                         doesn't mean it didn't happen. I 
                         heard Marsellus is very protective 
                         of you.

                                     MIA
                         A husband being protective of his 
                         wife is one thing. A husband almost 
                         killing another man for touching his 
                         wife's feet is something else.

                                     VINCENT
                         But did it happen?

                                     MIA
                         The only thing Antwan ever touched 
                         of mine was my hand, when he shook 
                         it. I met Anwan once � at my wedding 
                         � then never again.  The truth is, 
                         nobody knows why Marsellus tossed 
                         Tony Rocky Horror out of that window 
                         except Marsellus and Tony Rocky 
                         Horror. But when you scamps get 
                         together, you're worse than a sewing 
                         circle.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Vincent reacts.

                                     MIA
                         I wanna dance.

                                     VINCENT
                         No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.

                                     MIA
                              (overlapping)
                         No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do 
                         believe Marsellus, my husband, your 
                         boss, told you to take me out and do 
                         whatever I wanted, Now, I want to 
                         dance. I want to win. I want that

                                     VINCENT
                              (sighs)
                         All right.

                                     MIA
                         So, dance good.

                                     VINCENT
                         All right, you asked for it.

               Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor, toward Ed Sullivan.

                         contestants.

               Patrons cheer.

               Vincent and Mia walk up to the microphone.

                                     ED SULLIVAN
                         Now let's meet our first contestants 
                         here this evening. Young lady, what 
                         is your name?

                                     MIA
                              (into microphone)
                         Missus Mia Wallace.

                                     ED SULLIVAN
                              (into microphone)
                         And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?

                                     MIA
                              (into microphone)
                         Vincent Vega.

                                     ED SULLIVAN
                              (into microphone)
                         All right, let's see what you can 
                         do. Take it away!

               Mia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's "YOU NEVER CAN TELL". 
               They make hand movements as they dance.

               INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME � NIGHT

               The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-
               style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the 
               previous scene. They finish their little dance, laughing.

               Then...

               The two just stand face to face looking at each other.

                                     VINCENT
                         Was than an uncomfortable silence?

                                     MIA
                         I don't know what that was.
                              (pause)
                         Music and drinks!

               Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his 
               overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.

                                     VINCENT
                         I'm gonna take a piss.

                                     MIA
                         That was a little bit more information 
                         than I needed to know, but go right 
                         ahead.

               Vincent shuffles off to the john.

               Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs 
               and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high 
               energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She 
               dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's 
               overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It 
               feels good.

               Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch. 
               Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco 
               on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks 
               the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a 
               little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so 
               anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out 
               his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg, 
               trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you 
               know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly 
               brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, 
               then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.

               The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she 
               takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in 
               the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something 
               else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder 
               inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance. 
               Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her 
               face.

                                     MIA
                              (like you would say 
                              Bingo!)
                         Disco! Vince, you little cola nut, 
                         you've been holding out on me.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE) � NIGHT

               Vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to 
               himself in the mirror.

                                     VINCENT
                         One drink and leave. Don't be rude, 
                         but drink your drink quickly, say 
                         goodbye, walk out the door, get in 
                         your car, and go down the road.

               LIVING ROOM

               Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines 
               on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred 
               dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the 
               fat line.

               CLOSEUP � MIA

               Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels 
               like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong. 
               Then... the rush hits...

               BATHROOM

               Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his 
               dialogue with the mirror.

                                     VINCENT
                         ...It's a moral test of yourself, 
                         whether or not you can maintain 
                         loyalty. Because when people are 
                         loyal to each other, that's very 
                         meaningful.

               LIVING ROOM

               Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but 
               it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from 
               her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her 
               stomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.

               BATHROOM

               Vince continues.

                                     VINCENT
                         So you're gonna go out there, drink 
                         your drink, say "Goodnight, I've had 
                         a very lovely evening," go home, and 
                         jack off.  And that's all you're 
                         gonna do.

               Now that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's 
               ready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of 
               that door. So he goes through it.

               LIVING ROOM

               We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to 
               the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like 
               a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are 
               down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the 
               tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her 
               face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open. 
               Slack-jawed.

                                     VINCENT
                         Jesus Christ!

               Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body. 
               Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck 
               to check her pulse. She slightly stirs.

               Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.

                                     VINCENT
                              (sounding weird)
                         Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?

               But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles, 
               but they're not distinctive enough to be called words.

               Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.

                                     VINCENT
                              (to himself)
                         I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.
                              (to Mia)
                         Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer 
                         me honey, what did you take?

               Mia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard.

               Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the 
               rack.

               He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent 
               makes a beeline to Mia. We follow.

                                     VINCENT
                              (yelling to Mia)
                         Okay honey, we're getting you on 
                         your feet.

               He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.

                                     VINCENT
                         We're on our feet now, and now we're 
                         gonna talk out to the car. Here we 
                         go, watch us walk.

               We follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-
               unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.

               EXT. VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) � NIGHT

               INSERT SPEEDOMETER: red needle on a hundred.

               Vincent driving like a madman in a town without traffic laws, 
               speeds the car into turns and up and over hills.

               INT.VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) � NIGHT

               Vincent, one hand firmly on the wheel, the other shifting 
               like Robocop, both eyes staring straight ahead except when 
               he glances over at Mia.

               Mia, slack-jawed expression, mouth gaping, posture of a bag 
               of water.

               Vincent takes a cellular phone out of his pocket. He punches 
               a number.

               INT. LANCE'S HOUSE � NIGHT

               At this late hour, LANCE has transformed from a bon vivant 
               drug dealer to a bathrobe creature.

               He sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn-
               out but comfortable tee-shirt that has, written on it, "TAFT, 
               CALIFORNIA", and a moth-ridden terry cloth robe. In his hand 
               is a bowl of Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries. In front of 
               him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the Cap'n 
               Crunch with Crunch Berries came out of, and a hash pipe in 
               an ashtray.

               On the big-screen TV in front of the table is the Three 
               Stooges, and they're getting married.

                         Hold hands, you love birds.

               The phone RINGS.

               Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone.

               It RINGS again.

               Jody, his wife, CALLS from the bedroom, obviously woken up.

               Vincent is still driving like a stripe-assed ape, clutching 
               the phone to his ear. WE CUT BACK AND FORTH during the 
               conversation.

                         Too late, I'm already here.

               At that moment inside Lance's house, WE HEAR VINCENT's Malibu 
               coming up the street. Lance hangs up the phone, goes to his 
               curtains and YANKS the cord. The curtains open with a WHOOSH 
               in time to see Vincent's Malibu DRIVING UP on his front lawn 
               and CRASHING into his house. The window Lance is looking out 
               of SHATTERS from the impact.

               Lance CHARGES from the window, out the door to his front 
               lawn.

               WE START in Lance's and Jody's bedroom.

               Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up. She's 
               wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone 
               on it.

               We follow HANDHELD behind her as she opens the door, walking 
               through the hall into the living room.

               As she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance 
               standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of 
               the room.

               From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a 
               DOCUMENTARY in an emergency ward, with the big difference 
               here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing.

                         to her.

               WE FOLLOW Lance as he runs out of the living room into a...

               INT. SPARE ROOM

               With a bunch of junk in it. He frantically starts scanning 
               the junk for the book he's looking for, repeating the words, 
               "Come on," endlessly.

               From OFF SCREEN we hear:

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)

               Lance continues his frenzied search.

               WE HEAR Jody in the living room now as she talks to Vincent.

                                     JODY (O.S.)

                         I dunno, some medical book.

               Jody calls to LANCE.

                                     JODY (O.S.)

               As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit, 
               Jody appears in the doorway.

                         didn't you keep it with the shot?

               Lance spins toward her.

                         While you're lookin' for it, that 
                         girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're 
                         never gonna find it in all this shit.  
                         For six months now, I've been telling 
                         you to clean this room �

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         � get your ass in here, fuck the 
                         book!

               Lance angrily knocks over a pile of shit and leaves the SHOT 
               heading for the living room.

               LIVING ROOM

               Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance 
               reenters the room.

                                     VINCENT
                         Quit fuckin' around man and give her 
                         the shot!

               Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody. He 
               opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.

                         While I'm doing this, take her shirt 
                         off and find her heart.

               Vince rips her blouse open.

               Jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action.

                                     VINCENT
                         Does it have to be exact?

                                     LANCE
                         Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving 
                         her an injection in the heart, so I 
                         gotta exactly hit her in the heart.

                                     VINCENT
                         Well, I don't know exactly where her 
                         heart is, I think it's here.

               Vince points to Mia's right breast.  Lance glances over and 
               nods.

                                     LANCE
                         That's it.

               As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody.

                                     VINCENT
                         I need a big fat magic marker, got 
                         one?

                                     JODY
                         What?

                                     VINCENT
                         I need a big fat magic marker, any 
                         felt pen'll do, but a magic marker 
                         would be great.

                                     JODY
                         Hold on.

               Jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her 
               enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents 
               of which (bills, papers, pens) spill to the floor.

               The injection is ready. Lance hands Vincent the needle.

                         You're gonna give her the shot.

                         I've never does this before.

                                     LANCE
                         I've never done this before either, 
                         and I ain't starting now. You brought 
                         'er here, that means you give her 
                         the shot. The day I bring an ODing 
                         bitch to your place, then I gotta 
                         give her the shot.

               Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic 
               marker in her hand.

                                     JODY
                         Got it.

               Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes 
               a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is.

                                     VINCENT
                         Okay, what do I do?

                                     LANCE
                         Well, you're giving her an injection 
                         of adrenaline straight to her heart. 
                         But she's got a breast plate in front 
                         of her heart, so you gotta pierce 
                         through that. So what you gotta do 
                         is bring the needle down in a stabbing 
                         motion.

               Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like "The 
               Shape" killing its victims in "HALLOWEEN".

                                     VINCENT
                         I gotta stab her?

                                     LANCE
                         If you want the needle to pierce 
                         through to her heart, you gotta stab 
                         her hard.

               Then once you do, push down on the plunger.

               Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing 
               motion.

               He looks down on Mia.

               Mia is fading fast. Soon nothing will help her.

               Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this.

                         Count to three.

               Lance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know 
               what to expect.

               The needle leaves frame, THRUSTING down hard.

               Vincent brings the needle down hard, STABBING Mia in the 
               chest.

               Mia's head is JOLTED from the impact.

               The syringe plunger is pushed down, PUMPING the adrenaline 
               out through the needle.

               Mia's eyes POP WIDE OPEN and she lets out a HELLISH cry of 
               the banshee. She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck 
               in her chest � SCREAMING.

               Vincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in 
               front of Mia, JUMP BACK, scared to death.

               Mia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of 
               air.

               The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken 
               to their bones, look to see if she's alright.

               Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a 
               relatively normal voice.

                         Something.

               Vincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and 
               shaking from how close to death Mia came.

               Vincent is behind the wheel driving Mia home. No one says 
               anything, both are still too shaken.

               EXT. FRONT OF MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE � NIGHT

               The Malibu pulls up to the front. Mia gets out without saying 
               a word (still in a daze) and begins walking down the walkway 
               toward her front door.

               Vincent's out of the car, standing on the walkway, a big 
               distance between the two.

                         Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus 
                         can live his whole live and never 
                         ever hear of this incident.

               Mia smiles.

                                     MIA
                         Don't worry about it. If Marsellus 
                         ever heard of this, I'd be in as 
                         much trouble as you.

                         Sure, but I think I'm still a little 
                         too petrified to laugh.

                         not funny. But if you still wanna 
                         hear it, I'll tell it.

                         The baby tomato is lagging behind

                         tomato gets mad, goes over to the

               BUTCH'S POV

               We're in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in 
               Alhambra, California, in the year 1972. BUTCH'S MOTHER, 35ish, 
               stands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to 
               her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force 
               officer. The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old 
               boy.

                                     MOTHER
                         Butch, stop watching TV a second. We 
                         got a special visitor. Now do you 
                         remember when I told you your daddy 
                         dies in a P.O.W. camp?

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)
                         Uh-huh.

                                     MOTHER
                         Well this here is Capt. Koons. He 
                         was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.

               CAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and 
               bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's 
               eyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas 
               accent.

                                     CAPT. KOONS
                         Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard 
                         a bunch about you. See, I was a good 
                         friend of your Daddy's. We were in 
                         that Hanoi pit of hell over five 
                         years together.  Hopefully, you'll 
                         never have to experience this 
                         yourself, but when two men are in a 
                         situation like me and your Daddy 
                         were, for as long as we were, you 
                         take on certain responsibilities of 
                         the other. If it had been me who had 
                         not made it, Major Coolidge would be 
                         talkin' right now to my son Jim. But 
                         the way it worked out is I'm talkin' 
                         to you, Butch. I got somethin' for 
                         ya.

               The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.

                                     CAPT. KOONS
                         This watch I got here was first 
                         purchased by your great-granddaddy. 
                         It was bought during the First World 
                         War in a little general store in 
                         Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought 
                         by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge 
                         the day he set sail for Paris. It 
                         was your great-granddaddy's war watch, 
                         made by the first company to ever 
                         make wrist watches. You see, up until 
                         then, people just carried pocket 
                         watches. Your great-granddaddy wore 
                         that watch every day he was in the 
                         war. Then when he had done his duty, 
                         he went home to your great-
                         grandmother, took the watch off his 
                         wrist and put it in an ol' coffee 
                         can. And in that can it stayed 'til 
                         your grandfather Dane Coolidge was 
                         called upon by his country to go 
                         overseas and fight the Germans once 
                         again. This time they called it World 
                         War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave 
                         it to your granddad for good luck.  
                         Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as 
                         good as his old man's. Your granddad 
                         was a Marine and he was killed with 
                         all the other Marines at the battle 
                         of Wake Island. Your granddad was 
                         facing death and he knew it. None of 
                         those boys had any illusions about 
                         ever leavin' that island alive. So 
                         three days before the Japanese took 
                         the island, your 22-year old 
                         grandfather asked a gunner on an Air 
                         Force transport named Winocki, a man 
                         he had never met before in his life, 
                         to deliver to his infant son, who he 
                         had never seen in the flesh, his 
                         gold watch. Three days later, your 
                         grandfather was dead. But Winocki 
                         kept his word. After the war was 
                         over, he paid a visit to your 
                         grandmother, delivering to your infant 
                         father, his Dad's gold watch. This 
                         watch. This watch was on your Daddy's 
                         wrist when he was shot down over 
                         Hanoi. He was captured and put in a 
                         Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew 
                         if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd 
                         be confiscated. The way your Daddy 
                         looked at it, that watch was your 
                         birthright. And he'd be damned if 
                         and slopeheads were gonna put their 
                         greasy yella hands on his boy's 
                         birthright. So he hid it in the one 
                         place he knew he could hide somethin'. 
                         His ass. Five long years, he wore 
                         this watch up his ass. Then when he 
                         died of dysentery, he gave me the 
                         watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk 
                         of metal up my ass for two years. 
                         Then, after seven years, I was sent 
                         home to my family. And now, little 
                         man, I give the watch to you.

               Capt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes 
               into FRAME to accept it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOCKER ROOM � NIGHT

               The 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia: 
               trunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few 
               zzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to 
               him, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory, 
               he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.

               His trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a 
               little, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to 
               be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.

                                     KLONDIKE

                         I'm ready.

               Klondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB 
               outside.

               He goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. Butch 
               hops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him 
               on with the robe, which says on the back: "BATTLING BUTCH 
               COOLIDGE".

               The two men head for the door. Klondike opens the door for 
               Butch.

               As Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit. 
               Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet, 
               empty locker room.

                         My guess would be yes, Richard. I 
                         could see from my position here, the 
                         frenzy in his eyes give way to the 
                         realization of what he was doing. I

               ESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.

               Gym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS 
               to the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and 
               throws it to the ground.

               INT. TAXI (PARKED / RAINING) � NIGHT

               Butch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves, 
               HOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door.

               Esmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through 
               the rearview mirror:

                                     ESMARELDA
                              (Spanish accent)
                         Are you the man I was supposed to 
                         pick up?

                                     BUTCH
                         If you're the cab I called, I'm the 
                         guy you're supposed to pick up.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Where to?

                                     BUTCH
                         Outta here.

               The ignition key is TWISTED. The engine ROARS to life.

               The meter is FLIPPED on.

               Esmarelda's bare foot STOMPS on the gas pedal.

               EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) � NIGHT

               The cab WHIPS out of the alley, FISH-TAILING on the wet 
               pavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace.

               INT. WILLIS LOCKER ROOM (AUDITORIUM) � NIGHT

               Locker room door opens, English Dave fights his way through 
               the pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall, 
               shutting the door on the madness. Once inside, English Dave 
               takes time to adjust his suit and tie. Mia is standing by 
               the door. She sees Vincent with English Dave.

                                     VINCENT
                         Mia. How you doin'?

                                     MIA
                         Great. I never thanked you for the 
                         dinner.

               In the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table � 
               dead.

               His face looks like he went dunking for bees. His TRAINER is 
               on his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body.

               The huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table, 
               hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support. 
               We still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big.

               Mia sits in a chair at the far end of the room.

               Marsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         What'cha got?

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         He booked.

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         I'm prepared to scour the earth for 
                         this motherfucker. If Butch goes to 
                         Indo China, I want a nigger hidin' 
                         in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a 
                         cap in his ass.

                                     ENGLISH DAVE
                         I'll take care of it.

               INT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING) � NIGHT

               Butch gets one of his boxing gloves off.

               Esmeralda watches in the rearview mirror.

               He tries to roll down one of the backseat windows, but can't 
               find the roll bar.

                                     BUTCH
                         Hey, how do I open the window back 
                         here?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         I have to do it.

               She presses a button and the back window moves down. Butch 
               tosses his boxing glove out the window, then starts untying 
               the other one.

               Esmeralda can't keep quiet anymore.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Hey, mister?

                                     BUTCH
                              (still working on the 
                              glove)
                         What?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         You were in that fight? The fight on 
                         the radio � you're the fighter?

               As he tosses his other glove out the window.

                                     BUTCH
                         Whatever gave you that idea?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         No c'mon, you're him, I know you're 
                         him, tell me you're him.

                                     BUTCH
                              (drying himself with 
                              a gym towel)
                         I'm him.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         You killed the other boxing man.

                                     BUTCH
                         He's dead?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         The radio said he was dead.

               He finished wiping himself down.

                                     BUTCH
                              (to himself)
                         Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.

               He tosses the towel out the window.

               Silence, as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         What does it feel like?

                                     BUTCH
                              (finds his shirt)
                         What does what feel like?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Killing a man. Beating another man 
                         to death with your bare hands.

               Butch pulls on his tee-shirt.

                                     BUTCH
                         Are you some kinda weirdo?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         No, it's a subject I have much 
                         interest in. You are the first person 
                         I ever met who has killed somebody. 
                         So, what was it like to kill a man?

                                     BUTCH
                         Tell ya what, you give me one of 
                         them cigarettes, I'll give you an 
                         answer.

               Esmarelda bounces in her seat with excitement.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Deal!

               Butch leans forward. Esmarelda, keeping her eyes on the road, 
               passes a cigarette back to him. He takes it. Then, still not 
               looking behind her, she brings up her hand, a lit match in 
               it.

               Butch lights his smoke, then blows out the match.

               He takes a long drag.

                                     BUTCH
                         So...

               He looks at her license.

                                     BUTCH
                         ...Esmarelda Villalobos � is that 
                         Mexican?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         The name is Spanish, but I'm 
                         Columbian.

                                     BUTCH
                         It's a very pretty name.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         It mean "Esmarelda of the wolves."

                                     BUTCH
                         That's one hell of a name you got 
                         there, sister.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Thank you. And what is your name?

                                     BUTCH
                         Butch.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Butch. What does it mean?

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm an American, our names don't 
                         mean shit. Anyway, moving right along, 
                         what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         I want to know what it feels like to 
                         kill a man �

                                     BUTCH
                         � I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know 
                         he was dead 'til you told me he was 
                         dead. Now I know he's dead, do you 
                         wanna know how I feel about it?

               Esmarelda nods her head: "yes."

                                     BUTCH
                         I don't feel the least little bit 
                         bad.

               EXT. PHONE BOOTH (RAINING) � NIGHT

               We DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside.

                                     BUTCH
                              (into phone)
                         What'd I tell ya, soon as the word 
                         got out a fix was in, the odds would 
                         be outta control. Hey, if he was a 
                         better fighter he's be alive. If he 
                         never laced up his gloves in the 
                         first place, which he never shoulda 
                         done, he'd be alive. Enough about 
                         the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's 
                         talk about the rich and prosperous 
                         Mr. Butch.  How many bookies you 
                         spread it around with?

                                     (PAUSE)
                         Eight? How long to collect?
                              (pause)
                         So by tomorrow evening, you'll have 
                         it all?
                              (pause)
                         Good news Scotty, real good news � I 
                         understand a few stragglers aside. 
                         Me an'  Fabienne're gonna leave in 
                         the morning. It should take us a 
                         couple days to get into Knoxville. 
                         Next time we see each other, it'll 
                         be on Tennessee time.

               Butch hangs up the phone. He looks at the cab waiting to 
               take him wherever he wants to go.

                                     BUTCH
                              (to himself in French 
                              with English subtitles)
                         Fabienne my love, our adventure 
                         begins.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING) � NIGHT

               Esmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain 
               has stopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out, 
               now fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic 
               jacket. He leans in the driver's side window.

                                     ESMARELDA
                         Forty-five sixty.

               Handing her the money.

                                     BUTCH
                         Merci beaucoup. And here's a little 
                         something for the effort.

               Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill.

               Esmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds 
               it out of reach.

                                     BUTCH
                         Now if anybody should ask you about 
                         who your fare was tonight, what're 
                         you gonna tell 'em?

                                     ESMARELDA
                         The truth. Three well-dressed, 
                         slightly toasted, Mexicans.

               He gives her the bill.

                                     BUTCH
                         Bon soir, Esmarelda.

                                     ESMARELDA
                              (in Spanish)
                         Sleep well, Butch.

               He tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away. 
               She drives off.

               INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) � NIGHT

               Butch enters and turns on the light.

               Lying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to 
               us is Butch's French girlfriend, FABIENNE.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Keep the light off.

               Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.

                                     BUTCH
                         Is that better, sugar pop?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Oui. Hard day at the office?

                                     BUTCH
                         Pretty hard. I got into a fight.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Poor baby. Can we make spoons?

               Butch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind.

               When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in 
               babytalk.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I was looking at myself in the mirror.

                                     BUTCH
                         Uh-huh?

                                     FABIENNE
                         I wish I had a pot.

                                     BUTCH
                         You were lookin' in the mirror and 
                         you wish you had some pot?

                                     FABIENNE
                         A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are 
                         sexy.

                                     BUTCH
                         Well you should be happy, 'cause you 
                         do.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot! 
                         I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna 
                         when she did "Lucky Star," it's not 
                         the same thing.

                                     BUTCH
                         I didn't realize there was a 
                         difference between a tummy and a pot 
                         belly.

                                     FABIENNE
                         The difference is huge.

                                     BUTCH
                         You want me to have a pot?

                                     FABIENNE
                         No. Pot bellies make a man look either 
                         oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a 
                         woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The 
                         rest of you is normal. Normal face, 
                         normal legs, normal hips, normal 
                         ass, but with a big, perfectly round 
                         pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a 
                         tee-shirt two sizes too small to 
                         accentuate it.

                                     BUTCH
                         You think guys would find that 
                         attractive?

                                     FABIENNE
                         I don't give a damn what men find 
                         attractive. It's unfortunate what we 
                         find pleasing to the touch and 
                         pleasing to the eye is seldom the 
                         same.

                                     BUTCH
                         If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in 
                         it.

                                     FABIENNE
                         You'd punch me in my belly?

                                     BUTCH
                         Right in the belly.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your 
                         right on your face 'til you couldn't 
                         breathe.

                                     BUTCH
                         You'd do that to me?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Yes!

                                     BUTCH
                         Did you get everything, sugar pop?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Yes, I did.

                                     BUTCH
                         Good job.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Did everything go as planned?

                                     BUTCH
                         You didn't listen to the radio?

                                     FABIENNE
                         I never listen to your fights. Were 
                         you the winner?

                                     BUTCH
                         I won alright.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Are you still retiring?

                                     BUTCH
                         Sure am.

                                     FABIENNE
                         What about the man you fought?

                                     BUTCH
                         Floyd retired too.

                                     FABIENNE
                              (smiling)
                         Really?! He won't be fighting no 
                         more?!

                                     BUTCH
                         Not no more.

                                     FABIENNE
                         So it all worked out in the finish?

                                     BUTCH
                         We ain't at the finish, baby.

               Fabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.

                                     FABIENNE
                         We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE
                         If they find us, they'll kill us, 
                         won't they?

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE
                         But they won't find us, will they?

               Butch nods his head: "no."

                                     FABIENNE
                         Do you still want me to go with you?

               Butch nods his head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE
                         I don't want to be a burden or a 
                         nuisance -

               Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her 
               crotch.

               Fabienne reacts.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Say it!

                                     BUTCH
                         Fabienne, I want you to be with me.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Forever?

                                     BUTCH
                         ...and ever.

               Fabienne lies her head back.

               Butch continues to massage her crotch.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Do you love me?

                                     BUTCH
                         Oui.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?

               Butch kisses her on the mouth.

                                     BUTCH
                         Will you kiss it?

               She nods her head: "yes."

                                     FABIENNE
                         But you first.

               Butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral 
               pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame.

                                     FABIENNE
                              (in French, with 
                              English subtitles)
                         Butch my love, the adventure begins.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               FADE UP:

               MOTEL ROOM

               Same motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in 
               the bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We 
               see Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow 
               her up.

               She's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower 
               washing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the 
               smoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom. 
               Butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his 
               head out.

                                     BUTCH
                         I think I cracked a rib.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Giving me oral pleasure?

                                     BUTCH
                         No retard, from the fight.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Don't call me retard.

                                     BUTCH
                              (in a Mongoloid voice)
                         My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!

                                     FABIENNE
                         Shut up fuck head! I hate that 
                         Mongoloid voice.

                                     BUTCH
                         Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it 
                         back!  Can I have a towel please, 
                         Miss Beautiful Tulip.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Oh I like that, I like being called 
                         a tulip. Tulip is much better than 
                         Mongoloid.

               She finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban 
               on her head.

                                     BUTCH
                         I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I 
                         called you a retard, but I took it 
                         back.

               She hands him a towel.

                                     BUTCH
                         Merci beaucoup.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Butch?

                                     BUTCH
                              (drying his head)
                         Yes, lemon pie.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Where are we going to go?

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want. 
                         We're gonna get a lot of money from 
                         this. But it ain't gonna be so much, 
                         we can live like hogs in the fat 
                         house forever. I was thinking we 
                         could go somewhere in the South 
                         Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll 
                         carry us a long way down there.

                                     FABIENNE
                         So if we wanted, we could live in 
                         Bora Bora?

                                     BUTCH
                         You betcha. And if after awhile you 
                         don't dig Bora Bora, then we can 
                         move over to Tahiti or Mexico.

                                     FABIENNE
                         But I do not speak Spanish.

                                     BUTCH
                         You don't speak Bora Boran either.
                         Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta 
                         el zapataria?

                                     FABIENNE
                         What does that mean?

                                     BUTCH
                         Where's the shoe store?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Donde esta el zapataria?

                                     BUTCH
                         Excellent pronunciation. You'll be 
                         my little mama ceta in no time.

               Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes 
               her teeth.

               Butch keeps on from the other room.

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)
                         Que hora es?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Que hora es?

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)
                         What time is it?

                                     FABIENNE
                         What time is it?

                                     BUTCH (O.S.)
                         Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.

               Fabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or 
               two, then she remember something.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Butch.

               She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only 
               to find him sound asleep in bed.

               She looks at him for a moment.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Forget it.

               She exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the 
               WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               FADE UP:

               MOTEL ROOM � MORNING

               SAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still 
               asleep in bed.

               Fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the 
               bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still 
               wears the terry cloth robe from the night before.

               ON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking 
               on the entire Vietnamese army in the film "THE LOSERS".

               Butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing 
               him.

               His start startles Fabienne.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Merde! You startled me. Did you have 
                         a bad dream?

               Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to 
               focus.

               Butch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV 
               Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.

                                     BUTCH
                         What are you watching?

                                     FABIENNE
                         A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the 
                         name.

                                     BUTCH
                         Are you watchin' it?

               Fabienne enters the room.

                                     FABIENNE
                         In a way. Why? Would you like for me 
                         to switch it off?

                                     BUTCH
                         Would you please?

               She reaches over and turns off the TV.

                                     BUTCH
                         It's a little too early in the morning 
                         for explosions and war.

                                     FABIENNE
                         What was it about?

                                     BUTCH
                         How should I know, you were the one 
                         watchin' it.

               Fabienne laughs.

                                     FABIENNE
                         No, imbecile, what was your dream 
                         about?

                                     BUTCH
                         Oh, I... don't remember. It's really 
                         rare I remember a dream.

                                     FABIENNE
                         You just woke up from it.

                                     BUTCH
                         Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I 
                         don't remember.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Well, let's look at the grumpy man 
                         in the morning. I didn't say you 
                         were lying, it's just odd you don't 
                         remember your dreams. I always 
                         remember mine. Did you know you talk 
                         in your sleep?

                                     BUTCH
                         I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk 
                         in my sleep?

                                     FABIENNE
                         You did last night.

                                     BUTCH
                         What did I say?

               Laying on top of him.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I don't know. I couldn't understand 
                         you.

               She kisses Butch.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Why don't you get up and we'll get 
                         some breakfast at that breakfast 
                         place with the pancakes.

                                     BUTCH
                         One more kiss and I'll get up.

               Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Satisfied?

                                     BUTCH
                         Yep.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Then get up, lazy bones.

               Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of 
               the suitcase that Fabienne brought.

                                     BUTCH
                         What time is it?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Almost nine in the morning. What 
                         time does our train arrive?

                                     BUTCH
                         Eleven.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I'm gonna order a big plate of 
                         blueberry pancakes with maple syrup, 
                         eggs over easy, and five sausages.

                                     BUTCH
                              (surprised at her 
                              potential appetite)
                         Anything to drink with that?

               Butch is finished dressing.

                                     FABIENNE
                              (referring to his 
                              clothes)
                         Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a 
                         tall glass or orange juice and a 
                         black cup of coffee. After that, I'm 
                         going to have a slice of pie.

               As he goes through the suitcase.

                                     BUTCH
                         Pie for breakfast?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Any time of the day is a good time 
                         for pie. Blueberry pie to go with 
                         the pancakes. And on top, a thin 
                         slice of melted cheese �

                                     BUTCH
                         � where's my watch?

                                     FABIENNE
                         It's there.

                                     BUTCH
                         No, it's not. It's not here.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Have you looked?

               By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.

                                     BUTCH
                         Yes I've fuckin' looked!!

               He's now throwing clothes.

                                     BUTCH
                         What the fuck do you think I'm doing?! 
                         Are you sure you got it?

               Fabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer 
                         �

                                     BUTCH
                         � on the little kangaroo.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.

                                     BUTCH
                         Well it's not here!

                                     FABIENNE
                              (on the verge of tears)
                         Well it should be!

                                     BUTCH
                         Oh it most definitely should be here, 
                         but it's not. So where is it?

               Fabienne is crying and scared.

               Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more 
               menacing.

                                     BUTCH
                         Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin' 
                         watch. You know what my father went 
                         through to git me that watch?... I 
                         don't wanna get into it right now... 
                         but he went through a lot. Now all 
                         this other shit, you coulda set on 
                         fire, but I specifically reminded 
                         you not to forget my father's watch. 
                         Now think, did you get it?

                                     FABIENNE
                         I believe so...

                                     BUTCH
                         You believe so? You either did, or 
                         you didn't, now which one is it?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Then I did.

                                     BUTCH
                         Are you sure?

                                     FABIENNE
                              (shaking)
                         No.

               Butch freaks out, he punches the air.

               Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the 
               motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.

               Fabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.

               Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.

                                     BUTCH
                              (to Fabienne)
                         No! It's not your fault.
                              (he approached her)
                         You left it at the apartment.

               He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.

               He touches her hand, she flinches.

                                     BUTCH
                         If you did leave it at the apartment, 
                         it's not your fault. I had you bring 
                         a bunch of stuff. I reminded you 
                         about it, but I didn't illustrate 
                         how personal the watch was to me. If 
                         all I gave a fuck about was my watch, 
                         I should've told you. You ain't a 
                         mind reader.

               He kisses her hand. Then rises.

               Fabienne is still sniffling.

               Butch goes to the closet.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I'm sorry.

               Butch puts on his high school jacket.

                                     BUTCH
                         Don't be. It just means I won't be 
                         able to eat breakfast with you.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Why does it mean that?

                                     BUTCH
                         Because I'm going back to my apartment 
                         to get my watch.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Won't the gangsters be looking for 
                         you there?

                                     BUTCH
                         That's what I'm gonna find out. If 
                         they are, and I don't think I can 
                         handle it, I'll split.

               Rising from the floor.

                                     FABIENNE
                         I was so dreadful. I saw your watch, 
                         I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.

               Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.

                                     BUTCH
                         Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing 
                         you could ever do would make me 
                         permanently angry at you.
                              (pause)
                         I love you, remember?
                              (he digs some money 
                              out of his wallet)
                         Now here's some money, order those 
                         pancakes and have a great breakfast.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Don't go.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'll be back before you can say, 
                         blueberry pie.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Blueberry pie.

                                     BUTCH
                         Well maybe not that fast, but fast. 
                         Okay?  Okay?

                                     FABIENNE
                         Okay.

               He kisses her once more and heads for the door.

                                     BUTCH
                         Bye-bye, sugar pop.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Bye.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm gonna take your Honda.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Okay.

               And with that, he's out the door.

               Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.

               INT. HONDA (MOVING) � DAY

               Butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his 
               fists as he drives down the street.

                                     BUTCH
                         Of all the fuckin' things she coulda 
                         forgot, she forgets my father's watch. 
                         I specifically reminded her not to 
                         forget it. "Bedside table � on the 
                         kangaroo." I said the words: "Don't 
                         forget my father's watch."

               EXT. CITY STREET � DAY

               The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is 
               little engine will take it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the 
               arrow pointing at one hour.

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER � DAY

               Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a 
               couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before 
               he goes boppin' through the front door.

               EXT. ALLEY � DAY

               Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street, 
               then he discreetly glances out.

               EXT. STREET � BUTCH'S APARTMENT � DAY

               Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of 
               cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of 
               place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.  
               Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of 
               Butch's home.

               Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.

               Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He 
               crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.

               Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a 
               combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign 
               sticks up in the air, with the name "Teriyaki Donut" and a 
               graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.

               EXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD � DAY

               Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment 
               building. Once again, everything appears normal � the laundry 
               room, the pool, his apartment door � nothing appears 
               disturbed.

               Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12. 
               He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.

               Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening 
               it.

               INT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT � DAY

               His apartment hasn't been touched.

               He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick 
               look around. Obviously, no one is there.

               Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the 
               refrigerator.

               He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.

               With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he 
               goes to the bedroom.

               His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment � neat, clean 
               and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a 
               few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue 
               of "Ring Magazine" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of 
               Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.

               Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On 
               the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.

               He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He 
               opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting 
               down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and 
               puts them in the toaster.

               Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.

               What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun 
               with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.

                                     BUTCH
                              (softly)
                         Holy shit.

               He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines 
               it.

               Then... a toilet FLUSHES.

               Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to 
               the kitchen. There is someone behind it.

               Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not 
               knowing what to do.

               The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the 
               bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book 
               "MODESTY BLAISE" by Peter O'Donnell.

               Vincent and Butch lock eyes.

               Vincent freezes.

               Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's 
               direction.

               Neither man opens his mouth.

               Then... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.

               That's all the situation needed.

               Butch's finger HITS the trigger.

               MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.

               Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets 
               SIMULTANEOUSLY � LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him 
               through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door 
               at the end of the bathroom.

               By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent 
               is annihilated.

               Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look 
               goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once 
               Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.

               With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61 
               back on the kitchen counter.

               Then he exits the apartment, quickly.

               EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD � DAY

               Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the 
               courtyard...

               ...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...

               ...goes through the alley...

               ...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.

               EXT. HONDA � DAY

               Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide 
               smile of a survivor breaks across his face.

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET � DAY

               The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his 
               apartment building.

               INT. HONDA � DAY

               Butch looks out the window at his former home.

                                     BUTCH
                         That's how you're gonna beat 'em, 
                         Butch.  They keep underestimatin' 
                         ya.

               This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips 
               a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he 
               SINGS along with it.

               He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on 
               the corner across from Teriyaki Donut.

               Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we 
               see:

               THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

               The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut, 
               carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam 
               cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street 
               in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see 
               Marsellus clearly.

               Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front 
               of him.

               When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances 
               to his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!

               DOUBLE-TAKE: "Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?"

               Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question. 
               He STOMPS on the gas pedal.

               The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts 
               and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.

               Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold 
               Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending 
               it up on the sidewalk.

               Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what 
               at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his 
               nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play. 
               A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.

                                     PEDESTRIAN
                         Jesus, are you okay?

               Butch look at him, spaced-out.

                                     BUTCH
                         I guess.

               Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS 
               gather around the body.

                                     GAWKER #1
                              (to the others)
                         He's dead! He's dead!

               This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.

               TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.

               The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.

                                     GAWKER #2
                         If you need a witness in court, I'll 
                         be glad to help. He was a drunken 
                         maniac. He hit you and crashed into 
                         that car.

                                     MARSELLUS
                              (still incoherent)
                         Who?

                                     GAWKER #2
                              (pointing at Butch)
                         Him.

               Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge 
               down the street, looking a shambles.

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Well, I'll be damned.

               The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back 
               away.

               Marsellus starts moving toward Butch.

               Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward 
               him.

                                     BUTCH
                         Sacre bleu.

               Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt, 
               shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.

               He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground, 
               screaming.

                                     LOOKY-LOO WOMAN
                         Oh my God, I've been shot!

               That's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.

               Marsellus RUNS after him.

               The CROWD looks agape.

               Butch is in a mad, limping RUN.

               The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.

               Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a 
               sign that reads "MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP".

               INT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP � DAY

               MAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter 
               of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of 
               Butch RACES into his world.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Can I help you wit' somethin'?

                                     BUTCH
                         Shut up!

               Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands 
               next to the door.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Now you just wait one goddamn minute 
                         �

               Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in. 
               He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist 
               in Marsellus' face.

               The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man 
               FALLS FLAT on his back.

               Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.

               Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in 
               the face.

               Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold 
               of his middle finger.

                                     BUTCH
                         So you like chasing people, huh?

               He BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.  Butch 
               then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS 
               back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to 
               shield the splatter.

                                     BUTCH
                         Well guess what, big man, you caught 
                         me �

                                     MAYNARD (O.S.)
                         � hold it right there, godammit!

               Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a 
               pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.

                                     BUTCH
                         Look mister, this ain't any of your 
                         business �

                                     MAYNARD
                         � I'm makin' it my business! Now 
                         toss that gun!

               Butch does.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Now you on top, stand up and come to 
                         the counter.

               Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he 
               gets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face 
               with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.

               After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on 
               the counter and moves to the telephone.

               Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily 
               watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on 
               the line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just 
                         caught a coupl'a flies.

               Marsellus passes out.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               FADE UP:

               INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM � DAY

               TWO SHOT � BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

               They are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are 
               two S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and 
               a little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are 
               unconscious.

               Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both 
               guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two 
               prisoners look up at their captors.

               Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one 
               hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in 
               his belt.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Nobody kills anybody in my place of 
                         business except me or Zed.

               A BUZZER buzzes.

                                     MAYNARD
                         That's Zed.

               Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs 
               that lead to red curtains and goes through them.

               WE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed 
               inside the store.

               Butch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of 
               the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking 
               in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other, 
               all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both 
               share at what they've gotten themselves into.

               Maynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even 
               more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible. 
               The two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is 
               a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and 
               stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a 
               long time, then says:

                                     ZED
                              (to Maynard)
                         You said you waited for me?

                                     MAYNARD
                         I did.

                                     ZED
                         Then how come they're all beat up?

                                     MAYNARD
                         They did that to each other. They 
                         was fightin' when they came in. This 
                         one was gonna shoot that one.

                                     ZED
                              (to Butch)
                         You were gonna shoot him?

               Butch makes no reply.

                                     ZED
                         Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front 
                         of this place?

                                     MAYNARD
                         Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?

                                     ZED
                         No, it's Thursday.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Then she'll be fine.

                                     ZED
                         Bring out The Gimp.

                                     MAYNARD
                         I think The Gimp's sleepin'.

                                     ZED
                         Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em 
                         up then, won't you?

               Maynard opens a trap door in the floor.

                                     MAYNARD
                              (yelling in the hole)
                         Wake up!

               Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a 
               leash.

               He gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises 
               THE GIMP.

               The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black 
               leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs 
               here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather 
               mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth. 
               They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large 
               dog.

               Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners, 
               then lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed, 
               then backs away.

                                     MAYNARD
                              (to The Gimp)
                         Down!

               The Gimp gets on its knees.

               Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Who's first?

                                     ZED
                         I ain't fer sure yet.

               Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent "Eenie, meany, 
               miney, moe... " just his mouth mouthing the words and his 
               finger going back and forth between the two.

               Butch are Marsellus are terrified.

               Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.

               The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.

               Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving 
               left to right, then it stops.

               TWO SHOT � BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

               After a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on 
               Marsellus.

               Zed stands up.

                                     ZED
                         Wanna do it here?

                                     MAYNARD
                         Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old 
                         room.

               Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old 
               room.

               Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the 
               misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop. 
               Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and 
               Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the 
               back room, is empty.

               As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before 
               he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.

                                     MAYNARD
                              (to The Gimp)
                         Up!

               The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on 
               the ceiling.

                                     MAYNARD
                         Keep an eye on this one.

               The Gimp bows its head: "yes." Maynard disappears into 
               Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because 
               suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.

               Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath 
               the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history 
               of comedy.

               From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:

                                     MAYNARD (O.S.)
                         Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight 
                         in 'em!

               We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.

                                     ZED (O.S.)
                         You wanna fight? You wanna fight? 
                         Good, I like to fight!

               Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic, 
               hurriedly struggles to get free.

               The Gimp is laughing wildly.

               The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.

               The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:

                                     MAYNARD (O.S.)
                         That's it... that's it boy, you're 
                         goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like 
                         that... that's good.
                              (grunting faster)
                         Stay still... stay still goddamn ya! 
                         Zed goddammit, git over here and 
                         hold 'em!

               Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite 
               easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it 
               were never connected by a bolt.

               The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.

                                     THE GIMP
                         Huhng?

               The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook. 
               He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles 
               and grunts.

               Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S 
               PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making 
               him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash 
               attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then 
               silently makes his way through the red curtains.

               INT. PAWNSHOP � DAY

               Butch sneaks to the door.

               On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected 
               to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he 
               stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their 
               way with Marsellus.

               Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in 
               a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the 
               pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in 
               with.

               He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards 
               it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks 
               about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large 
               Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots 
               what he's been looking for:

               A Samurai sword.

               It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the 
               wall, next to a neon "DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER" sign. 
               Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its 
               sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten 
               in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his 
               thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not 
               on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems 
               made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the 
               sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears 
               through the red curtains to take care of business.

               INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM � DAY

               Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.

               Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind 
               the closed door that leads to Russell's old room.

               INT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM � DAY

               Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It 
               swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched 
               positions.

               Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden 
               horse.

               Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.

               Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up 
               behind him with the sword.

               Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus, 
               red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see 
               Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.

                                     BUTCH
                         Hey hillbilly.

               Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.

               Butch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across 
               the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on 
               Zed.

               Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.

               Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword 
               behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing 
               the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.

               Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go 
               from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic, 
               which lies within reach.

               Butch's eyes follow Zed's.

                                     BUTCH
                         You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.

               Zed's hand inches toward the weapon.

               Butch GRIPS the sword tighter.

               Zed studies Butch.

               Butch looks hard at Zed.

               Then a VOICE says:

                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
                         Step aside, Butch.

               Butch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him, 
               holding Maynard's pump-action shotgun.

               KABOOM!!!!

               Zed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.

               Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the 
               used shotgun shell.

               Butch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:

                                     BUTCH
                         You okay?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from 
                         okay!

               Long pause.

                                     BUTCH
                         What now?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         What now? Well let me tell you what 
                         now.  I'm gonna call a couple pipe-
                         hittin' niggers, who'll go to work 
                         on homes here with a pair of pliers 
                         and a blow torch.
                              (to Zed)
                         Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I 
                         ain't through with you by a damn 
                         sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on 
                         your ass.

                                     BUTCH
                         I meant what now, between me and 
                         you?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell 
                         ya what now between me an' you. There 
                         is no me an' you. Not no more.

                                     BUTCH
                         So we're cool?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I 
                         ask � two things I ask: Don't tell 
                         nobody about this. This shit's between 
                         me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-
                         the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in-
                         agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It 
                         ain't nobody else's business. Two: 
                         leave town. Tonight. Right now. And 
                         when you're gone, stay gone.  You've 
                         lost your Los Angeles privileges.  
                         Deal?

                                     BUTCH
                         Deal.

               The two men shake hands, then hug one another.

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Go on now, get your ass outta here.

               Butch leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains.

               Marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.

                                     MARSELLUS
                              (into the phone)
                         Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta 
                         bit of a situation.

               EXT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP � DAY

               Butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He 
               looks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment, 
               Zed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has 
               the name "GRACE" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys 
               with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES 
               to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit. 
               Butch twists the accelerator handle and SPEEDS off.

               WE CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN...

               INT. BUTCH AND FABIENNE'S HOTEL ROOM � DAY

               Fabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a "Frankie says, 
               Relax" tee-shirt, singing along with MUSIC coming from a 
               BOOM BOX.

               EXT. CITY STREET � CHOPPER (MOVING) � DAY

               Butch drives down the street, humping a hot hog named "GRACE." 
               He checks his father's watch. It says: 10:30.

               The SONG in the motel room PLAYS OVER this.

               EXT. MOTEL ROOM � DAY

               Butch rides up on Grace. He hops off and runs inside the 
               motel room, while we stay outside with the bike.

                                     FABIENNE (O.S.)
                         Butch, I was so worried!

                                     BUTCH
                         Honey, grab your radio and your purse 
                         and let's go!

                                     FABIENNE (O.S.)
                         But what about all our bags?

                                     BUTCH
                         Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train 
                         if we don't split now.

                                     FABIENNE (O.S.)
                         Is everything well? Are we in danger?

                                     BUTCH
                         We're cool. In fact, we're super-
                         cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait 
                         for you outside.

               Butch runs out and hops back on the bike. Fabienne exits the 
               motel room with the boom box and a large purse. When she 
               sees Butch on the chopper, she stops dead.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Where did you get this motorcycle?

                                     BUTCH
                              (he kick-starts it)
                         It's a chopper, baby, hop on.

               Fabienne slowly approaches the two-wheel demon.

                                     FABIENNE
                         What happened to my Honda?

                                     BUTCH
                         Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.

                                     FABIENNE
                         You're hurt?

                                     BUTCH
                         I might've broke my nose, no biggie. 
                         Hop on.

               She doesn't move.

               Butch looks at her.

                                     BUTCH
                         Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!

               Fabienne starts to cry.

               Butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the 
               bike. He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her 
               hand.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm sorry, baby-love.

                                     FABIENNE
                              (crying)
                         You were gone so long, I started to 
                         think dreadful thoughts.

                                     BUTCH
                         I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie.
                         Everything's fine. Hey, how was 
                         breakfast?

                                     FABIENNE
                              (waterworks drying a 
                              little)
                         It was good �

                                     BUTCH
                         � did you get the blueberry pancakes?

                                     FABIENNE
                         No, they didn't have blueberry 
                         pancakes, I had to get buttermilk � 
                         are you sure you're okay?

                                     BUTCH
                         Baby-love, from the moment I left 
                         you, this has been without a doubt 
                         the single weirdest day of my entire 
                         life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about 
                         it.

               Fabienne does climb on. Butch STARTS her up.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Butch, whose motorcycle is this?

                                     BUTCH
                         It's a chopper.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Whose chopper is this?

                                     BUTCH
                         Zed's.

                                     FABIENNE
                         Who's Zed?

                                     BUTCH
                         Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.

               And with that, the two lovebirds PEEL AWAY on Grace, as the 
               SONG on the BOOM BOX RISES.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

                         There's a passage I got memorized, 
                         seems appropriate for this situation: 
                         Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 
                         righteous man is beset on all sides 
                         by the inequities of the selfish and 
                         the tyranny of evil men..."

               FADE UP:

               INT. BATHROOM � DAY

               We're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in 
               earlier. In fact, we're there at exactly the same time. Except 
               this time, we're in the bathroom with the FOURTH MAN. The 
               Fourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard 
               to what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly 
               CLUTCHING his huge silver .357 Magnum.

                                     JULES (O.S.)
                         "...blessed is he who, in the name 
                         of charity and good will, shepherded 
                         the weak through the valley of 
                         darkness. And I will strike down 
                         upon thee with great vengeance and 
                         furious anger those who attempt to 
                         poison and destroy my brothers. And 
                         you will know I am the Lord when I 
                         lay my vengeance upon you."

               BANG! BANG! BOOM! POW! BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!

               The Fourth Man freaks out. He THROWS himself against the 
               back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow 
               fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough 
               to stick their head through that door.

               Then he listens to them talk.

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         Friend of yours?

                                     JULES (O.S.)
                         Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin.

               Waiting for them isn't the smartest move. Bursting out the 
               door and blowing them all away while they're fuckin' around 
               is the way to go.

               INT. APARTMENT � DAY

               The bathroom door BURSTS OPEN and the Fourth Man CHARGES 
               out, silver Magnum raised, FIRING SIX BOOMING SHOTS from his 
               hand cannon.

                                     FOURTH MAN
                         Die... die... die... die...!

               DOLLY INTO Fourth Man, same as before.

               He SCREAM until he's dry firing. Then a look of confusion 
               crosses his face.

               TWO SHOT � JULES AND VINCENT

               Standing next to each other, unharmed. Amazing as it seems, 
               none of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody. 
               Jules and Vincent exchange looks like, "Are we hit?" They're 
               as confused at the shooter. After looking at each other, 
               they bring their looks up to the Fourth Man.

                                     FOURTH MAN
                         I don't understand �

               The Fourth Man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's 
               bullets who, unlike his, HIT their marks. He drops DEAD.

               The two men lower their guns. Jules, obviously shaken, sits 
               down in a chair. Vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs 
               it off.

               Then heads toward Marvin in the corner.

                                     VINCENT
                         Why the fuck didn't you tell us about 
                         that guy in the bathroom? Slip your 
                         mind?  Forget he was in there with a 
                         goddamn hand cannon?

                                     JULES
                              (to himself)
                         We should be fuckin' dead right now.
                              (pause)
                         Did you see that gun he fired at us? 
                         It was bigger than him.

                                     VINCENT
                         .357.

                                     JULES
                         We should be fuckin' dead!

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, we were lucky.

               Jules rises, moving toward Vincent.

                                     JULES
                         That shit wasn't luck. That shit was 
                         somethin' else.

               Vincent prepares to leave.

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, maybe.

                                     JULES
                         That was... divine intervention. You 
                         know what divine intervention is?

                                     VINCENT
                         Yeah, I think so. That means God 
                         came down from Heaven and stopped 
                         the bullets.

                                     JULES
                         Yeah, man, that's what is means. 
                         That's exactly what it means! God 
                         came down from Heaven and stopped 
                         the bullets.

                                     VINCENT
                         I think we should be going now.

                                     JULES
                         Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do 
                         that!  Don't blow this shit off! 
                         What just happened was a fuckin' 
                         miracle!

                                     VINCENT
                         Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit 
                         happens.

                                     JULES
                         Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just 
                         happen.

                                     VINCENT
                         Do you wanna continue this theological 
                         discussion in the car, or at the 
                         jailhouse with the cops?

                                     JULES
                         We should be fuckin' dead now, my 
                         friend!  We just witnessed a miracle, 
                         and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge 
                         it!

                                     VINCENT
                         Okay man, it was a miracle, can we 
                         leave now?

               EXT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT BUILDING � MORNING

               The Chevy Nova PROPELS itself into traffic.

               INT. NOVA (MOVING) � MORNING

               Jules is behind the wheel,Vincent in the passenger seat and 
               Marvin in the back.

                                     VINCENT
                         ...Ever seen that show "COPS?"  I 
                         was watchin' it once and this cop 
                         was on it who was talkin' about this 
                         time he got into this gun fight with 
                         a guy in a hallway. He unloads on 
                         this guy and he doesn't hit anything. 
                         And these guys were in a hallway. 
                         It's a freak, but it happens.

                                     JULES
                         If you wanna play blind man, then go 
                         walk with a Shepherd. But me, my 
                         eyes are wide fuckin' open.

                                     VINCENT
                         What the fuck does that mean?

                                     JULES
                         That's it for me. For here on in, 
                         you can consider my ass retired.

                                     VINCENT
                         Jesus Christ!

                                     VINCENT
                         Goddammit, Jules �

                                     JULES
                         � I said don't do that �

                                     VINCENT
                         � you're fuckin' freakin' out!

                                     JULES
                         I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm 
                         through.

                                     VINCENT
                         While you're at it, be sure to tell 
                         'im why.

                                     JULES
                         Don't worry, I will.

                                     VINCENT
                         I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he 
                         laughs his ass off.

                                     JULES
                         I don't give a damn if he does.

               Vincent turns to the backseat with the .45 casually in his 
               grip.

                                     VINCENT
                         Marvin, what do you make of all this?

                                     MARVIN
                         I don't even have an opinion.

                                     VINCENT
                         C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came 
                         down from Heaven and stopped the 
                         bullets?

               Vincent's .45 goes BANG!

               Marvin is hit in the upper chest, below the throat. He GURGLES 
               blood and SHAKES.

                                     JULES
                         What the fuck's happening?

                                     VINCENT
                         I just accidentally shot Marvin in 
                         the throat.

                                     JULES
                         Why the fuck did you do that?

                                     VINCENT
                         I didn't mean to do it. I said it 
                         was an accident.

                                     JULES
                         I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in

                         � chill out, man, it was an accident, 
                         okay? You hit a bump or somethin' 
                         and the gun went off.

                                     JULES
                         The car didn't hit no motherfuckin' 
                         bump!

                                     VINCENT
                         Look! I didn't mean to shoot this 
                         son-ofa-bitch, the gun just went 
                         off, don't ask me how!

                                     JULES
                         Look at this mess! We're drivin' 
                         around on a city street in broad 
                         daylight �

                         about the splatter.

                                     JULES
                         Well you better be thinkin' about it 
                         now, motherfucker! We gotta get this 
                         car off the road. Cops tend to notice 
                         shit like you're driving a car 
                         drenched in fuckin' blood.

                                     VINCENT
                         Can't we just take it to a friendly 
                         place?

                                     JULES
                         This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus 
                         don't got no friendly places in the 
                         Valley.

                                     VINCENT
                         Well, don't look at me, this is your 
                         town, Jules.

               Jules takes out a cellular phone and starts punching digits.

                                     VINCENT

                         On the other side of the hill, by 
                         Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass 
                         ain't home, I don't know what the 
                         fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any 
                         other partners in 818.
                              (into phone)
                         Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules.
                              (pause)
                         Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are 
                         in some serious shit. We're in a car 
                         we gotta get off the road, pronto! I 
                         need to use your garage for a couple 
                         hours.

               INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM � DAY

               Jules is bent over a sink, washing his bloody hands while 
               Vincent stands behind him.

                                     JULES
                         We gotta be real fuckin' delicate 
                         with this Jimmie's situation. He's 
                         one remark away from kickin' our 
                         asses out the door.

                                     VINCENT
                         If he kicks us out, whadda we do?

                                     JULES
                         Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made 
                         a couple phone calls. But I never 
                         want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's 
                         my friend and you don't bust in your 
                         friend's house and start tellin' 'im 
                         what's what.

               Jules rises and dries his hands. Vincent takes his place at 
               the sink.

                                     VINCENT
                         Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He 
                         kinda freaked out back there when he 
                         saw Marvin.

                                     JULES
                         Put yourself in his position. It's 
                         eight o'clock in the morning. He 
                         just woke up, he wasn't prepared for 
                         this shit. Don't forget who's doin' 
                         who a favor.

               Vincent finishes, then dries his hands on a white towel.

                                     VINCENT
                         If the price of that favor is I gotta 
                         take shit, he can stick his favor 
                         straight up his ass.

               When Vincent is finished drying his hands, the towel is 
               stained with red.

                                     JULES
                         What the fuck did you just do to his 
                         towel?

                                     VINCENT
                         I was just dryin' my hands.

                                     JULES
                         You're supposed to wash 'em first.

                                     VINCENT
                         You watched me wash 'em.

                                     JULES
                         I watched you get 'em wet.

                                     VINCENT
                         I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to 
                         get off. Maybe if he had some Lava, 
                         I coulda done a better job.

                                     JULES
                         I used the same soap you did and 
                         when I dried my hands, the towel 
                         didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie 
                         pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who 
                         cares? But it's shit like this that's 
                         gonna bring this situation to a boil. 
                         If he were to come in here and see 
                         that towel like that... I'm tellin' 
                         you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause 
                         if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie 
                         on account of you... Look, I ain't 
                         threatenin' you, I respect you an' 
                         all, just don't put me in that 
                         position.

                                     JULES
                         Jules, you ask me nice like that, no 
                         problem. He's your friend, you handle 
                         him.

               INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN � MORNING

               Three men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug 
               of coffee. Jules, Vincent and JIMMIE DIMMICK, a young man in 
               his late 20s dressed in a bathrobe.

                                     JULES
                         Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious 
                         gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda 
                         been satisfied with freeze-dried 
                         Tasters Choice. You spring this 
                         gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What 
                         flavor is this?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Knock it off, Julie.

                                     JULES
                         What?

                                     JIMMIE
                         I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can 
                         stop butterin' me up. I don't need 
                         you to tell me how good my coffee 
                         is. I'm the one who buys it, I know 
                         how fuckin' good it is.  When Bonnie 
                         goes shoppin;, she buys shit.  I buy 
                         the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause 
                         when I drink it, I wanna taste it. 
                         But what's on my mind at this moment 
                         isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's 
                         the dead nigger in my garage.

                                     JULES
                         Jimmie �

                                     JIMMIE
                         � I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a 
                         question, Jules. When you drove in 
                         here, did you notice a sign out front 
                         that said, "Dead nigger storage?"

               Jules starts to "Jimmie" him �

                                     JIMMIE
                         � answer to question. Did you see a 
                         sign out in front of my house that 
                         said, "Dead nigger storage?"

                                     JULES
                              (playing along)
                         Naw man, I didn't.

                                     JIMMIE
                         You know why you didn't see that 
                         sign?

                                     JULES
                         Why?

                                     JIMMIE
                         'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my 
                         fuckin' business!

               Jules starts to "Jimmie" him.

                                     JIMMIE
                         � I ain't through! Now don't you 
                         understand that if Bonnie comes home 
                         and finds a dead body in her house, 
                         I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage 
                         counselor, no trial separation � 
                         fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna 
                         get fuckin' divorced. The last time 
                         me an' Bonnie talked about this shit 
                         was gonna be the last time me an' 
                         Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I 
                         wanna help ya out Julie, I really 
                         do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife 
                         doin' it.

                                     JULES
                         Jimmie �

                                     JIMMIE
                         � don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I 
                         can't be Jimmied. There's nothin' 
                         you can say that's gonna make me 
                         forget I love my wife. Now she's 
                         workin' the graveyard shift at the 
                         hospital. She'll be comin' home in 
                         less than an hour and a half. Make 
                         your phone calls, talk to your people, 
                         than get the fuck out of my house.

                                     JULES
                         That's all we want. We don't wanna 
                         fuck up your shit. We just need to 
                         call our people to bring us in.

                                     JIMMIE
                         Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's 
                         in my bedroom.

               INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S DINING ROOM � MORNING

               Marsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a big comfy 
               robe, eating his large breakfast, while talking on the phone.

                                     MARSELLUS
                         ...well, say she comes home. Whaddya 
                         think she'll do?
                              (pause)
                         No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That 
                         ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er, 
                         I don't.  How bad, a lot or a little?

               INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM � MORNING

               Jules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone.

                                     JULES
                         You got to appreciate what an 
                         explosive element this Bonnie 
                         situation is. If she comes home from 
                         a hard day's work and finds a bunch 
                         of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta' 
                         shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin' 
                         what she's apt to do.

                                     MARSELLUS
                         I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm 
                         doin' is contemplating the "ifs."

                                     JULES
                         I don't wanna hear about no 
                         motherfuckin' "ifs."What I wanna 
                         hear from your ass is: "you ain't 
                         got no problems, Jules. I'm on the 
                         motherfucker. Go back in there, chill 
                         them niggers out and wait for the 
                         cavalry, which should be comin' 
                         directly."

                                     MARSELLUS
                         You ain't got no problems, Jules. 
                         I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in 
                         there, chill them niggers out and 
                         wait for The Wolf, who should be 
                         comin' directly.

                                     JULES
                         You sendin' The Wolf?

                                     MARSELLUS
                         Feel better?

                                     JULES
                         Shit Negro, that's all you had to 
                         say.

               INT. HOTEL SUITE � MORNING

               The CAMERA looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite 
               into the main area. We SEE a crap game being played on a 
               fancy crap table by GAMBLERS in tuxedos and LUCKY LADIES in 
               fancy evening gowns. The CAMERA PANS to the right revealing: 
               Sitting on a bed, phone in hand with his back to us, the 
               tuxedo-clad WINSTON WOLF aka "THE WOLF". We also see The 
               Wolf has a small notepad that he jots details in.

                                     THE WOLF
                              (into phone)
                         Is she the hysterical type?
                              (pause)
                         When she due?
                              (jotting down)
                         Give me the principals' names again?
                              (jots down)
                         Jules...

               We SEE his book. The page has written on it:

                            "1265 Riverside Drive Toluca Lake 1 body (no head) 
                            Bloody shot-up car Jules (black)"

                                     THE WOLF
                         ...Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...

               HE WRITES:

                   "Vincent (Dean Martin) Jimmie (house) Bonnie (9:30)"

                                     THE WOLF
                         Expect a call around 10:30. It's 
                         about thirty minutes away. I'll be 
                         there in ten.

               He hangs up. We never see his face.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TITLE CARD OVER BLACK:

                      "NINE MINUTES AND THIRTY-SEVEN SECONDS LATER"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. JIMMIE'S STREET � MORNING

               A silver Porsche WHIPS the corner leading to Jimmie's home, 
               in HYPER DRIVE. Easily doing 135 mph, the Porsche stops on a 
               dime in front of Jimmie's house.

               A ringed finger touches the doorbell: DING DONG.

               INT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE � MORNING

               Jimmie opens the door. We see, standing in the doorway, the 
               tuxedo-clad man. He looks down to his notebook, then up at 
               Jimmie.

                                     THE WOLF
                         You're Jimmie, right? This is your 
                         house?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Yeah.

                                     THE WOLF
                              (stick his hand out)
                         I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.

                                     JIMMIE
                         Good, 'cause we got one.

                                     THE WOLF
                         So I heard. May I come in?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Please do.

               In the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up.

                                     THE WOLF
                         You must be Jules, which would make 
                         you Vincent. Let's get down to brass 
                         tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed 
                         correctly, the clock is ticking, is 
                         that right, Jimmie?

                                     JIMMIE
                         100%.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Your wife, Bonnie...
                              (refers to his pad)
                         ...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is 
                         that correct?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Uh-huh.

                                     THE WOLF
                         I was led to believe if she comes 
                         home and finds us here, she wouldn't 
                         appreciate it none too much.

                                     JIMMIE
                         She won't at that.

                                     THE WOLF
                         That gives us forty minutes to get 
                         the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you 
                         do what I say when I say it, should 
                         by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a 
                         car, minus a head, in a garage. Take 
                         me to it.

               INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE � MORNING

               The three men hang back as The Wolf examines the car. He 
               studies the car in silence, opening the door, looking inside, 
               circling it.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Jimmie?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Yes.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I 
                         smelled some coffee in there. Would 
                         you make me a cup?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Sure, how do you take it?

                                     THE WOLF
                         Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

               Jimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination.

                                     THE WOLF
                         About the car, is there anything I 
                         need to know? Does it stall, does it 
                         make a lot of noise, does it smoke, 
                         is there gas in it, anything?

                                     JULES
                         Aside from how it looks, the car's 
                         cool.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Positive?  Don't get me out on the 
                         road and I find out the brake lights 
                         don't work.

                                     JULES
                         Hey man, as far as I know, the 
                         motherfucker's tip-top.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Good enough, let's go back to the 
                         kitchen.

               INT. KITCHEN � MORNING

               Jimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Thank you, Jimmie.

               He takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the 
               three men the plan of action.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Okay first thing, you two.
                              (meaning Jules and 
                              Vincent)
                         Take the body, stick it in the trunk. 
                         Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty 
                         domesticated house. That would lead 
                         me to believe that in the garage or 
                         under the sink, you got a bunch of 
                         cleansers and cleaners and shit like 
                         that, am I correct?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Good. What I need you two fellas to 
                         do is take those cleaning products 
                         and clean the inside of the car. And 
                         I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You 
                         need to go in the backseat, scoop up 
                         all those little pieces of brain and 
                         skull. Get it out of there.  Wipe 
                         down the upholstery � now when it 
                         comes to upholstery, it don't need 
                         to be spic and span, you don't need 
                         to eat off it. Give it a good once 
                         over. What you need to take care of 
                         are the really messy parts. The pools 
                         of blood that have collected, you 
                         gotta soak that shit up.  But the 
                         windows are a different story.  Them 
                         you really clean. Get the Windex, do 
                         a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to 
                         raid your linen closet. I need 
                         blankets, I need comforters, I need 
                         quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker 
                         the better, the darker the better. 
                         No whites, can't use 'em. We need to 
                         camouflage the interior of the car. 
                         We're gonna line the front seat and 
                         the backseat and the floor boards 
                         with quilts and blankets. If a cop 
                         stops us and starts stickin' his big 
                         snout in the car, the subterfuge 
                         won't last. But at a glance, the car 
                         will appear to be normal.  Jimmie � 
                         lead the way, boys � get to work.

               The Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving 
               Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen.

                                     VINCENT
                              (calling after him)
                         A "please" would be nice.

               The Wolf stops and turns around.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Come again?

                                     VINCENT
                         I said a "please" would be nice.

               The Wolf takes a step toward him.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Set is straight, Buster. I'm not 
                         here to say "please."I'm here to 
                         tell you want to do. And if self-
                         preservation is an instinct you 
                         possess, you better fuckin' do it 
                         and do it quick. I'm here to help.
                         If my help's not appreciated, lotsa 
                         luck gentlemen.

                                     JULES
                         It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your 
                         help is definitely appreciated.

                                     VINCENT
                         I don't mean any disrespect. I just 
                         don't like people barkin' orders at 
                         me.

                                     THE WOLF
                         If I'm curt with you, it's because 
                         time is a factor. I think fast, I 
                         talk fast, and I need you guys to 
                         act fast if you want to get out of 
                         this. So pretty please, with sugar 
                         on top, clean the fuckin' car.

               INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM � MORNING

               Jimmie's gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he 
               has.

               The Wolf is on the phone.

                                     THE WOLF
                              (into phone)
                         It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
                              (pause)
                         White.
                              (pause)
                         Nothin', except for the mess inside.
                              (pause)
                         About twenty minutes.
                              (pause)
                         Nobody who'll be missed.
                              (pause)
                         You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon.
                              (he looks at Jimmie)
                         How we comin', Jimmie?

               Jimmie comes over with a handful of linen.

                                     JIMMIE
                         Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand 
                         somethin' �

                                     THE WOLF
                         � Winston, Jimmie � please, Winston.

                                     JIMMIE
                         You gotta understand something, 
                         Winston. I want to help you guys out 
                         and all, but that's my best linen. 
                         It was a wedding present from my 
                         Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and 
                         they ain't with us anymore �

                                     THE WOLF
                         � let me ask you a question, if you 
                         don't mind?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Sure.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny 
                         millionaires?

                                     JIMMIE
                         No.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And 
                         I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and 
                         Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they 
                         would've furnished you with a whole 
                         bedroom set, which your Uncle 
                         Marsellus is more than happy to do.
                              (takes out a roll of 
                              bills)
                         I like oak myself, that's what's in 
                         my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie, 
                         you an oak man?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Oak's nice.

               INT. GARAGE � MORNING

               Both Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up. 
               Vincent is in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is 
               in the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs 
               of brain.

               Both are twice as bloody as they were before.

                                     JULES
                         I will never forgive your ass for 
                         this shit. This is some fucked-up 
                         repugnant shit!

                                     VINCENT
                         Did you ever hear the philosophy 
                         that once a man admits he's wrong, 
                         he's immediately forgiven for all 
                         wrong-doings?

                                     JULES
                         Man, get outta my face with that 
                         shit! The motherfucker who said that 
                         never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces 
                         of skull with his fingers on account 
                         of your dumb ass.

                                     VINCENT
                         I got a threshold, Jules. I got a 
                         threshold for the abuse I'll take. 
                         And you're crossin' it. I'm a race 
                         car and you got me in the red. Redline 
                         7000, that's where you are. Just 
                         know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be 
                         drivin' a race car when it's in the 
                         red. It could blow.

                                     JULES
                         You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a 
                         mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker!  
                         Every time my fingers touch brain 
                         I'm "SUPERFLY T.N.T," I'm the "GUNS 
                         OF NAVARONE." I'm what Jimmie Walker 
                         usta talk about. In fact, what the 
                         fuck am I doin' in the back?  You're 
                         the motherfucker should be on brain 
                         detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin' 
                         windows and you're pickin' up this 
                         nigger's skull.

               INT. CHEVY NOVA � MORNING

               The interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with 
               bedspreads and quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a 
               portable slaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript 
               vehicle.

               The Wolf circles the car examining it.

               Jules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a 
               bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a 
               good job they've done.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out 
                         of this yet.

                                     JIMMIE
                         I can't believe that's the same car.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Well, let's not start suckin' each 
                         other's dicks quite yet. Phase one 
                         is complete, clean the car, which 
                         moves us right along to phase two, 
                         clean you two.

               EXT. JIMMIE'S BACKYARD � MORNING

               Jules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits, 
               covered in blood, in Jimmie's backyard. Jimmie holds a plastic 
               Hefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one 
               of those guns nozzles attached.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Strip.

                                     VINCENT
                         All the way?

                                     THE WOLF
                         To your bare ass.

               As they follow directions, The Wolf enjoys a smoke.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Quickly gentlemen, we got about 
                         fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better-
                         half comes pulling into the driveway.

                                     JULES
                         This morning air is some chilly shit.

                                     VINCENT
                         Are you sure this is absolutely 
                         necessary?

                                     THE WOLF
                         You know what you two look like?

                                     VINCENT
                         What?

                                     THE WOLF
                         Like a couple of guys who just blew 
                         off somebody's head. Yes, strippin' 
                         off those bloody rags is absolutely 
                         necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's 
                         garbage bag.

                                     JULES
                         Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid 
                         like puttin' that out in front of 
                         your house for Elmo the garbage man 
                         to take away.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Don't worry, we're takin' it with 
                         us. Jim, the soap.

               He hands the now-naked men a bar of soap.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Okay gentlemen, you're both been to 
                         County before, I'm sure. Here it 
                         comes.

               He hits the trigger, water SHOOTS OUT, SMACKING both men.

                                     JULES
                         Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!

                                     THE WOLF
                         Better you than me, gentlemen.

               The two men, trembling, scrub themselves.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Don't be afraid of the soap, spread 
                         it around.

               The Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Towel 'em.

               Jimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously 
               across their bodies.

                                     THE WOLF
                         You're dry enough, give 'em their 
                         clothes.

               FADE UP ON:

               JULES AND VINCENT In their tee-shirts and swim trunks. They 
               look a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses 
               we first met.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've 
                         planned this better. You guys look 
                         like... what do they look like, 
                         Jimmie?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Dorks. They look like a couple of 
                         dorks.

               The Wolf and Jimmie laugh.

                                     JULES
                         Ha ha ha. They're your clothes, 
                         motherfucker.

                                     JIMMIE
                         I guess you just gotta know how to 
                         wear them.

                                     JULES
                         Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert 
                         on wearin' dorky shit that your is.

                                     THE WOLF
                         C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and 
                         jokin' our way into prison. Don't 
                         make me beg.

               INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE � MORNING

               The garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin. 
               The Wolf SLAMS is closed.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Gentlemen, let's get our rules of 
                         the road straight. We're going to a 
                         place called Monster Joe's Truck and 
                         Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter 
                         Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma.  
                         The place is North Hollywood, so a 
                         few twist and turns aside, we'll be 
                         goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll 
                         drive the tainted car. Jules, you 
                         ride with me.  Vincent, you follow 
                         in my Porsche. Now if we cross the 
                         path of any John Q. Laws, nobody 
                         does a fuckin' thing 'til I do 
                         something.

                                     (TO JULES)
                         What did I say?

                                     JULES
                         Don't do shit unless �

                                     THE WOLF
                         � unless what?

                                     JULES
                         Unless you do it first.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Spoken like a true prodigy.
                              (to Vincent)
                         How 'bout you, Lash Larue?  Can you 
                         keep your spurs from jingling and 
                         jangling?

                                     VINCENT
                         I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went 
                         off, I dunno how.

                                     THE WOLF
                         Fair enough.
                              (he throws Vince his 
                              car keys)
                         I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep 
                         up. If I get my car back any different 
                         than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna 
                         be disposing of two bodies.

               EXT. MONSTER JOE'S TRUCK AND TOW � MORNING

               Jules and Vincent wait by Winston's Porsche.

                         Like it never happened.

               Jules and Vincent bump fists.

                                     WINSTON
                         Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all 
                         this will be hers.

                                     RAQUEL
                              (to the boys)
                         Hi. You know, if they ever do "I 
                         SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE," you guys, 
                         I'd be great.  What's with the 
                         outfits. You guys going to a 
                         volleyball game?

               Winston laughs, the boys groan.

                                     WINSTON
                         I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast. 
                         Maybe I can drop you two off. Where 
                         do you live?

                                     VINCENT

               Winston grabs Jules' wrist and pantomimes like he's in a 
               "DEAD ZONE" trance.

                                     WINSTON
                              (painfully)
                         It's your future: I see... a cab 
                         ride.
                              (dropping the act)
                         Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.
                              (to Raquel)
                         Say goodbye, Raquel.

                         Goodbye, Raquel.

                                     WINSTON
                         I'll see you two around, and stay 
                         outta trouble, you crazy kids.

               Winston turns to leave.

                                     JULES
                         Mr. Wolf.

               He turns around.

                                     JULES
                         I was a pleasure watchin' you work.

               The Wolf smiles.

                                     WINSTON
                         Call me Winston.

               He turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche.

                                     WINSTON
                         You hear that, young lady? Respect. 
                         You could lean a lot from those two 
                         fine specimens. Respect for one's 
                         elders shows character.

                                     RAQUEL
                         I have character.

                                     WINSTON
                         Just because you are a character 
                         doesn't mean you have character.

                                     RAQUEL
                         Oh you're so funny, oh you're so 
                         funny.

               The Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.

               The two men left alone look at each other.

                                     JULES
                         Wanna share a cab?

                                     VINCENT
                         You know I could go for some 
                         breakfast.  Want to have breakfast 
                         with me?

                                     JULES
                         Sure.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP � MORNING

               Jules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a 
               big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto. 
               Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a 
               muffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a 
               refill for both men,

                                     VINCENT
                         Thanks a bunch.
                              (to Jules, who's 
                              nursing his coffee)
                         Want a sausage?

                                     JULES
                         Naw, I don't eat pork.

                                     VINCENT
                         Are you Jewish?

                                     JULES
                         I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig 
                         on swine.

                                     VINCENT
                         Why not?

                                     JULES
                         They're filthy animals. I don't eat 
                         filthy animals.

                                     VINCENT
                         Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste 
                         good.

                                     JULES
                         A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin 
                         pie.  I'll never know 'cause even if 
                         it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy 
                         motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in 
                         shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't 
                         wanna eat nothin' that ain't got 
                         enough sense to disregard its own 
                         feces.

                                     VINCENT
                         How about dogs? Dogs eat their own 
                         feces.

                                     JULES
                         I don't eat dog either.

                                     VINCENT
                         Yes, but do you consider a dog to be 
                         a filthy animal?

                                     JULES
                         I wouldn't go so far as to call a 
                         dog filthy, but they're definitely 
                         dirty. But a dog's got personality. 
                         And personality goes a long way.

                                     VINCENT
                         So by that rationale, if a pig had a 
                         better personality, he's cease to be 
                         a filthy animal?

                                     JULES
                         We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one 
                         motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd 
                         have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.

               The two men laugh.

                                     VINCENT
                         Good for you. Lighten up a little. 
                         You been sittin' there all quiet.

                                     JULES
                         I just been sittin' here thinkin'.

                                     VINCENT
                              (mouthful of food)
                         About what?

                                     JULES
                         The miracle we witnessed.

                                     VINCENT
                         The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed 
                         a freak occurrence.

                                     JULES
                         Do you know that a miracle is?

                                     VINCENT
                         An act of God.

                                     JULES
                         What's an act of God?

                                     VINCENT
                         I guess it's when God makes the 
                         impossible possible. And I'm sorry 
                         Jules, but I don't think what happened 
                         this morning qualifies.

                                     JULES
                         Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't 
                         matter. You're judging this thing 
                         the wrong way. It's not about what. 
                         It could be God stopped the bullets, 
                         he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found 
                         my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge 
                         shit like this based on merit. Whether 
                         or not what we experienced was an 
                         according-to-Hoyle miracle is 
                         insignificant. What is significant 
                         is I felt God's touch, God got 
                         involved.

                                     VINCENT
                         But why?

                                     JULES
                         That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I 
                         don't know why. But I can't go back 
                         to sleep.

                                     VINCENT
                         So you're serious, you're really 
                         gonna quit?

                                     JULES
                         The life, most definitely.

               Vincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In 
               the b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.

                                     PATRON
                         Garcon! Coffee!

               We recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene 
               of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.

                                     VINCENT
                         So if you're quitting the life, 
                         what'll you do?

                                     JULES
                         That's what I've been sitting here 
                         contemplating. First, I'm gonna 
                         deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, 
                         basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.

                                     VINCENT
                         What do you mean, walk the earth?

                                     JULES
                         You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU." 
                         Just walk from town to town, meet 
                         people, get in adventures.

                                     VINCENT
                         How long do you intend to walk the 
                         earth?

                                     JULES
                         Until God puts me where he want me 
                         to be.

                                     VINCENT
                         What if he never does?

                                     JULES
                         If it takes forever, I'll wait 
                         forever.

                                     VINCENT
                         So you decided to be a bum?

                                     JULES
                         I'll just be Jules, Vincent � no 
                         more, no less.

                                     VINCENT
                         No Jules, you're gonna be like those 
                         pieces of shit out there who beg for 
                         change. They walk around like a bunch 
                         of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in 
                         garbage bins, they eat what I throw 
                         away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got 
                         a word for 'em, they're called bums. 
                         And without a job, residence, or 
                         legal tender, that's what you're 
                         gonna be � a fuckin' bum!

                                     JULES
                         Look my friend, this is just where 
                         me and you differ �

                                     VINCENT
                         � what happened was peculiar � no 
                         doubt about it � but it wasn't water 
                         into wine.

                                     JULES
                         All shapes and sizes, Vince.

                                     VINCENT
                         Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!

                                     JULES
                         If you find my answers frightening, 
                         Vincent, you should cease askin' 
                         scary questions.

                                     VINCENT
                         I gotta take a shit. To be continued.

               Vincent exits for the restroom.

               Jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin 
               and Honey Bunny rise with guns raised.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Any of you fuckin' pricks move and 
                         I'll execute every one of you 
                         motherfuckers!  Got that?!

               Jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the 
               table, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it 
               out, COCKING IT.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Customers stay seated, waitresses on 
                         the floor.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die, 
                         do it or fucking die!

               Like lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While 
               Honey Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them 
               terrified.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out 
                         here!  Asta luego!

               Three COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         On the floor or I'll cook you ass, 
                         comprende?

               They comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.

                                     MANAGER
                         I'm the manager here, there's no 
                         problem, no problem at all �

               Pumpkin heads his way.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         You're gonna give me a problem?

               He reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the 
               Manager's neck.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         What? You said you're gonna give me 
                         a problem?

                                     MANAGER
                         No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you 
                         any problem!

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks 
                         like the hero type to me!

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Don't take any chances. Execute him!

               The Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his 
               hand tightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.

                                     MANAGER
                         Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm 
                         just a coffee shop manager. Take 
                         anything you want.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll 
                         be all over.

                                     MANAGER
                         Everybody just be calm and cooperate 
                         with them and this will be all over 
                         soon!

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Well done, now git your fuckin' ass 
                         on the ground.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM � MORNING

               Vincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside, 
               reads his "MODESTY BLAISE" book.

               INT. COFFEE SHOP � MORNING

               Cash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from 
               the till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter 
               with a trash bag in his hand.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Okay people, I'm going to go 'round 
                         and collect your wallets. Don't talk, 
                         just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?

               Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his 
               .45 ready to spit under the table.

               Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet, 
               briefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more 
               respectful, him manner more on guard.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         In the bag.

               Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer, 
               Pumpkin points to the briefcase.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         What's in that?

                                     JULES
                         My boss' dirty laundry.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         You boss makes you do his laundry?

                                     JULES
                         When he wants it clean.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Sounds like a shit job.

                                     JULES
                         Funny, I've been thinkin' the same 
                         thing.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Open it up.

               Jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.

                                     JULES
                         'Fraid I can't do that.

               Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the 
               gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the 
               hammer.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I didn't hear you.

                                     JULES
                         Yes, you did.

               This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard 
               it, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         What's goin' on?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Looks like we got a vigilante in our 
                         midst.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Shoot 'em in the face!

                                     JULES
                         I don't mean to shatter your ego, 
                         but this ain't the first time I've 
                         had gun pointed at me.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         You don't open up that case, it's 
                         gonna be the last.

                                     MANAGER
                              (on the ground)
                         Quit causing problems, you'll get us 
                         all killed! Give 'em what you got 
                         and get 'em out of here.

                                     JULES
                         Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat 
                         man, this ain't any of your goddamn 
                         business!

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I'm countin' to three, and if your 
                         hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna 
                         unload right in your fuckin' face. 
                         Clear? One...

                                     PUMPKIN
                         ...two... three.

                                     JULES
                         You win.

               Jules raises his hand off the briefcase.

                                     JULES
                         It's all yours, Ringo.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Open it.

               Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to 
               Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case. 
               Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across 
               the room, can't see shit.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         What is it? What is it?

                                     PUMPKIN
                              (softly)
                         Is that what I think it is?

               Jules nods his head: "yes."

                                     PUMPKIN
                         It's beautiful.

               Jules nods his head: "yes."

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Goddammit, what is it?

               Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering 
               the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to 
               pick up the case.

               Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of 
               Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand 
               comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45 
               hand under Pumpkin's chin.

               Honey Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction.

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow 
                         your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya! 
                         I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're 
                         gonna fuckin' die bad!

                                     JULES
                              (to Pumpkin)
                         Tell that bitch to be cool! Say, 
                         bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Chill out, honey!

                                     HONEY BUNNY
                         Let him go!

                                     JULES
                              (softly)
                         Tell her it's gonna be okay.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I'm gonna be okay.

                                     JULES
                         Promise her.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         I promise.

                                     JULES
                         Tell her to chill.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Just chill out.

                                     JULES
                         What's her name?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Yolanda.

               Whenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only 
               at Pumpkin.

                                     JULES
                              (to Yolanda)
                         So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna 
                         do anything stupid, are we?

                                     YOLANDA
                              (crying)
                         Don't you hurt him.

                                     JULES
                         Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're 
                         gonna be like three Fonzies. And 
                         what' Fonzie like?

               No answer.

                                     JULES
                         C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?

                                     YOLANDA
                              (through tears, unsure)
                         He's cool?

                                     JULES
                         Correct-amundo! And that's what we're 
                         gonna be, we're gonna be cool.
                              (to Pumpkin)
                         Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three 
                         and I want you to let go your gun 
                         and lay your palms flat on the table. 
                         But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?

               Pumpkin looks at him.

                                     JULES
                         One... two... three.

               Pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.

               Yolanda can't stand it anymore.

                                     YOLANDA
                         Okay, now let him go!

                                     JULES
                         Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be 
                         cool.  When you yell at me, it makes 
                         me nervous.  When I get nervous, I 
                         get scared. And when motherfuckers 
                         get scared, that's when motherfuckers 
                         get accidentally shot.

                                     YOLANDA
                              (more conversational)
                         Just know: you hurt him, you die.

                                     JULES
                         That seems to be the situation. Now 
                         I don't want that and you don't want 
                         that and Ringo here don't want that. 
                         So let's see what we can do.
                              (to Ringo)
                         Now this is the situation. Normally 
                         both of your asses would be dead as 
                         fuckin' fried chicken. But you 
                         happened to pull this shit while I'm 
                         in a transitional period. I don't 
                         wanna kill ya, I want to help ya. 
                         But I'm afraid I can't give you the 
                         case. It don't belong to me. Besides, 
                         I went through too much shit this 
                         morning on account of this case to 
                         just hand it over to your ass.

                                     VINCENT (O.S.)
                         What the fuck's goin' on here?

               Yolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.

               Vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at 
               Yolanda.

                                     JULES
                         It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't 
                         do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's 
                         cool baby, nothin's changed. We're 
                         still just talkin'.
                              (to Pumpkin)
                         Tell her we're still cool.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still 
                         cool.

                                     VINCENT
                              (gun raised)
                         What the hell's goin' on, Jules?

                                     JULES
                         Nothin' I can't handle. I want you 
                         to just hang back and don't do shit 
                         unless it's absolutely necessary.

                                     VINCENT
                         Check.

                                     JULES
                         Yolanda, how we doin, baby?

                                     YOLANDA
                         I gotta go pee! I want to go home.

                                     JULES
                         Just hang in there, baby, you're 
                         doing' great, Ringo's proud of you 
                         and so am I.  It's almost over.
                              (to Pumpkin)
                         Now I want you to go in that bag and 
                         find my wallet.

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Which one is it?

                                     JULES
                         It's the one that says Bad 
                         Motherfucker on it.

               Pumpkin looks in the bag and � sure enough � there's a wallet 
               with "Bad Motherfucker" embroidered on it.

                                     JULES
                         That's my bad motherfucker. Now open 
                         it up and take out the cash. How 
                         much is there?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         About fifteen hundred dollars.

                                     JULES
                         Put it in your pocket, it's yours. 
                         Now with the rest of them wallets 
                         and the register, that makes this a 
                         pretty successful little score.

                                     VINCENT
                         Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen 
                         hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on 
                         general principle.

                                     JULES
                         You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing, 
                         now hang back and shut the fuck up. 
                         Besides, I ain't givin' it to him. 
                         I'm buyin' somethin' for my money. 
                         Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         What?

                                     JULES
                         Your life. I'm givin' you that money 
                         so I don't hafta kill your ass. You 
                         read the Bible?

                                     PUMPKIN
                         Not regularly.

                                     JULES
                         There's a passage I got memorized. 
                         Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 
                         righteous man is beset on all sides 
                         by the inequities of the selfish and 
                         the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is 
                         he who, in the name of charity and 
                         good will, shepherds the weak through 
                         the valley of the darkness. For he 
                         is truly his brother's keeper and 
                         the finder of lost children. And I 
                         will strike down upon thee with great 
                         vengeance and furious anger those 
                         who attempt to poison and destroy my 
                         brothers. And you will know I am the 
                         Lord when I lay my vengeance upon 
                         you." I been sayin' that shit for 
                         years.  And if you ever heard it, it 
                         meant your ass. I never really 
                         questioned what it meant. I thought 
                         it was just a coldblooded thing to 
                         say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped 
                         a cap in his ass. But I saw some 
                         shit this mornin' made me think twice. 
                         Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're 
                         the evil man. And I'm the righteous 
                         man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the 
                         shepherd protecting my righteous ass 
                         in the valley of darkness. Or is 
                         could by you're the righteous man 
                         and I'm the shepherd and it's the 
                         world that's evil and selfish.  I'd 
                         like that. But that shit ain't the 
                         truth. The truth is you're the weak. 
                         And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But 
                         I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to 
                         be a shepherd.

               Jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.

               Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to 
               Yolanda.

               She looks back.

               Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the 
               door.

               Jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time, 
               takes a sip of coffee.

                                     JULES
                              (to himself)
                         It's cold.

               He pushes it aside.

               Vincent appears next to Jules.

                                     VINCENT
                         I think we oughta leave now.

                                     JULES
                         That's probably a good idea.

               Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the 
               briefcase.

               Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the 
               Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes 
               � wearing UC Santa Cruz and "I'm with Stupid" tee-shirts, 
               swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics � walk out of 
               the coffee shop together without saying a word.

                                                                   FADE OUT

                                         THE END

                        Based upon the story 
                Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption
	                   by Stephen King



1	INT -- CABIN -- NIGHT (1946) 

	A dark, empty room. 

	The door bursts open. A MAN and WOMAN enter, drunk and 
	giggling, horny as hell. No sooner is the door shut than 
	they're all over each other, ripping at clothes, pawing at 
	flesh, mouths locked together. 

	He gropes for a lamp, tries to turn it on, knocks it over 
	instead. Hell with it. He's got more urgent things to do, like 
	getting her blouse open and his hands on her breasts. She 
	arches, moaning, fumbling with his fly. He slams her against 
	the wall, ripping her skirt. We hear fabric tear. 

	He enters her right then and there, roughly, up against the 
	wall. She cries out, hitting her head against the wall but not 
	caring, grinding against him, clawing his back, shivering with 
	the sensations running through her. He carries her across the 
	room with her legs wrapped around him. They fall onto the bed. 

	CAMERA PULLS BACK, exiting through the window, traveling 
	smoothly outside... 

2	EXT -- CABIN -- NIGHT (1946) 2

	...to reveal the bungalow, remote in a wooded area, the 
	lovers' cries spilling into the night... 

	...and we drift down a wooded path, the sounds of rutting 
	passion growing fainter, mingling now with the night sounds of 
	crickets and hoot owls... 

	...and we begin to hear FAINT MUSIC in the woods, tinny and
	incongruous, and still we keep PULLING BACK until... 

	...a car is revealed. A 1946 Plymouth. Parked in a clearing. 

3	INT -- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT (1946) 3

	ANDY DUFRESNE, mid-20's, wire rim glasses, three-piece suit. 
	Under normal circumstances a respectable, solid citizen; hardly
	dangerous, perhaps even meek. But these circumstances are far 
	from normal. He is disheveled, unshaven, and very drunk. A 
	cigarette smolders in his mouth. His eyes, flinty and hard, are 
	riveted to the bungalow up the path. 

	He can hear them fucking from here. 

	He raises a bottle of bourbon and knocks it back. The radio 
	plays softly, painfully romantic, taunting him: 

		You stepped out of a dream... 
		You are too wonderful... 
		To be what you seem... 

	He opens the glove compartment, pulls out an object wrapped
	in a rag. He lays it in his lap and unwraps it carefully --

	-- revealing a .38 revolver. Oily, black, evil. 

	He grabs a box of bullets. Spills them everywhere, all over 
	the seats and floor. Clumsy. He picks bullets off his lap, 
	loading them into the gun, one by one, methodical and grim. 
	Six in the chamber. His gaze goes back to the bungalow. 

	He shuts off the radio. Abrupt silence, except for the distant 
	lovers' moans. He takes another shot of bourbon courage, then 
	opens the door and steps from the car. 

4	EXT -- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT (1946) 4

	His wingtip shoes crunch on gravel. Loose bullets scatter to 
	the ground. The bourbon bottle drops and shatters. 

	He starts up the path, unsteady on his feet. The closer he 
	gets, the louder the lovemaking becomes. Louder and more 
	frenzied. The lovers are reaching a climax, their sounds of 
	passion degenerating into rhythmic gasps and grunts. 

				WOMAN (O.S.) 
		Oh god...oh god...oh god... 

	Andy lurches to a stop, listening. The woman cries out in 
	orgasm. The sound slams into Andy's brain like an icepick. He 
	shuts his eyes tightly, wishing the sound would stop. 

	It finally does, dying away like a siren until all that's left 
	is the shallow gasping and panting of post-coitus. We hear 
	languorous laughter, moans of satisfaction. 

				WOMAN (O.S.) 
		Oh god...that's sooo good...you're 
		the best...the best I ever had... 

	Andy just stands and listens, devastated. He doesn't look like 
	much of a killer now; he's just a sad little man on a dirt 
	path in the woods, tears streaming down his face, a loaded gun 
	held loosely at his side. A pathetic figure, really.

5	INT -- COURTROOM -- DAY (1946) 5

	THE JURY listens like a gallery of mannequins on display, 
	pale-faced and stupefied. 

				D.A. (O.S.) 
		Mr. Dufresne, describe the 
		confrontation you had with your 
		wife the night she was murdered. 

	ANDY DUFRESNE 

	is on the witness stand, hands folded, suit and tie pressed, 
	hair meticulously combed. He speaks in soft, measured tones: 

				ANDY 
		It was very bitter. She said she 
		was glad I knew, that she hated all 
		the sneaking around. She said she 
		wanted a divorce in Reno. 

				D.A. 
		What was your response? 

				ANDY 
		I told her I would not grant one. 

				D.A. 
			(refers to his notes) 
		I'll see you in Hell before I see
		you in Reno. Those were the words 
		you used, Mr. Dufresne, according 
		to the testimony of your neighbors. 

				ANDY 
		If they say so. I really don't 
		remember. I was upset. 

	FADE TO BLACK: 2ND TITLE UP 

				D.A. 
		What happened after you and your 
		wife argued? 

				ANDY 
		She packed a bag and went to stay 
		with Mr. Quentin. 

				D.A. 
		Glenn Quentin. The golf pro at the 
		Falmouth Hills Country Club. The 
		man you had recently discovered was 
		her lover. 
			(Andy nods) 
		Did you follow her? 

				ANDY 
		I went to a few bars first. Later, 
		I decided to drive to Mr. Quentin's 
		home and confront them. They 
		weren't there...so I parked my car 
		in the turnout...and waited. 

				D.A. 
		With what intention? 

				ANDY 
		I'm not sure. I was confused. Drunk. 
		I think mostly I wanted to scare them. 

				D.A. 
		You had a gun with you? 

				ANDY 
		Yes. I did. 

	FADE TO BLACK: 3RD TITLE UP 

				D.A. 
		When they arrived, you went up 
		to the house and murdered them? 

				ANDY 
		No. I was sobering up. I realized 
		she wasn't worth it. I decided to 
		let her have her quickie divorce. 

				D.A. 
		Quickie divorce indeed. A .38 
		caliber divorce, wrapped in a 
		handtowel to muffle the shots, 
		isn't that what you mean? And then 
		you shot her lover! 

				ANDY 
		I did not. I got back in the car 
		and drove home to sleep it off. 
		Along the way, I stopped and threw 
		my gun into the Royal River. I feel 
		I've been very clear on this point. 

				D.A. 
		Yes, you have. Where I get hazy, 
		though, is the part where the 
		cleaning woman shows up the next 
		morning and finds your wife and her 
		lover in bed, riddled with .38 
		caliber bullets. Does that strike 
		you as a fantastic coincidence, Mr. 
		Dufresne, or is it just me? 

				ANDY 
			(softly) 
		Yes. It does. 

				D.A. 
		I'm sorry, Mr. Dufresne, I don't 
		think the jury heard that. 

				ANDY 
		Yes. It does. 

				D.A. 
		Does what? 

				ANDY 
		Strike me as a fantastic coincidence. 

				D.A. 
		On that, sir, we are in accord... 

	FADE TO BLACK! 4TH TITLE UP 

				D.A. 
		You claim you threw your gun into 
		the Royal River before the murders 
		took place. That's rather convenient. 

				ANDY 
		It's the truth. 

				D.A. 
		You recall Lt. Mincher's testimony? 
		He and his men dragged that river 
		for three days and nary a gun was 
		found. So no comparison can be made 
		between your gun and the bullets 
		taken from the bloodstained corpses 
		of the victims. That's also rather 
		convenient, isn't it, Mr. Dufresne? 

				ANDY 
			(faint, bitter smile) 
		Since I am innocent of this crime, 
		sir, I find it decidedly inconvenient 
		the gun was never found. 

	FADE TO BLACK: STH TITLE UP 

6	INT -- COURTROOM -- DAY (1946) 6

	The D.A. holds the jury spellbound with his closing summation:

				D.A. 
		Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard 
		all the evidence, you know all the 
		facts. We have the accused at the 
		scene of the crime. We have foot 
		prints. Tire tracks. Bullets 
		scattered on the ground which bear 
		his fingerprints. A broken bourbon 
		bottle, likewise with fingerprints. 
		Most of all, we have a beautiful 
		young woman and her lover lying 
		dead in each other's arms. They had 
		sinned. But was their crime so 
		great as to merit a death sentence? 

	He gestures to Andy sitting quietly with his ATTORNEY. 

				D.A. 
		I suspect Mr. Dufresne's answer to 
		that would be yes. I further 
		suspect he carried out that 
		sentence on the night of September 
		21st, this year of our Lord, 1946, 
		by pumping four bullets into his 
		wife and another four into Glenn 
		Quentin. And while you think about 
		that, think about this... 

	He picks up a revolver, spins the cylinder before their eyes 
	like a carnival barker spinning a wheel of fortune. 

				D.A. 
		A revolver holds six bullets, not 
		eight. I submit to you this was not 
		a hot-blooded crime of passion! 
		That could at least be understood, 
		if not condoned. No, this was 
		revenge of a much more brutal and 
		cold-blooded nature. Consider! Four 
		bullets per victim! Not six shots 
		fired, but eight! That means he 
		fired the gun empty...and then 
		stopped to reload so he could shoot 
		each of them again! An extra bullet 
		per lover...right in the head. 
			(a few JURORS shiver) 
		I'm done talking. You people are 
		all decent, God-fearing Christian 
		folk. You know what to do. 

	FADE TO BLACK: 6TH TITLE UP 

7	INT -- JURY ROOM -- DAY (1946) 7

	CAMERA TRACKS down a long table, moving from one JUROR to the 
	next. These decent, God-fearing Christians are chowing down on 
	a nice fried chicken dinner provided them by the county, 
	smacking greasy lips and gnawing cobbettes of corn. 

				VOICE (O.S.) 
		Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty... 

	We find the FOREMAN at the head of the table, sorting votes. 

	FADE TO BLACK: 7TH TITLE UP 

8	INT -- COURTROOM -- DAY (1946) 8

	Andy stands before the dias. THE JUDGE peers down, framed by a 
	carved frieze of blind Lady Justice on the wall. 

				JUDGE 
		You strike me as a particularly icy 
		and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne. 
		It chills my blood just to look at 
		you. By the power vested in me by 
		the State of Maine, I hereby order 
		you to serve two life sentences, 
		back to back, one for each of your 
		victims. So be it. 

	He raps his gavel as we 

	CRASH TO BLACK: LAST TITLE UP. 

9 	AN IRON-BARRED DOOR 9

	slides open with an enormous CLANG. A stark room waits beyond.
	CAMERA PUSHES through. SEVEN HUMORLESS MEN sit side by side at
	a long table. An empty chair faces them. We are now in: 

	INT -- SHAWSHANK HEARINGS ROOM -- DAY (1947) 

	RED enters, removes his cap and waits by the chair. 

				MAN #1 
		Sit. 

	Red sits, tries not to slouch. The chair is uncomfortable. 

				MAN #2 
		We see by your file you've served 
		twenty years of a life sentence. 

				MAN #3 
		You feel you've been rehabilitated? 

				RED 
		Yes, sir. Absolutely. I've learned 
		my lesson. I can honestly say I'm a 
		changed man. I'm no longer a danger 
		to society. That's the God's honest 
		truth. No doubt about it. 

	The men just stare at him. One stifles a yawn. 

	CLOSEUP -- PAROLE FORM 

	A big rubber stamp slams down: "REJECTED" in red ink. 

10	EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- DUSK (1947) 10

	High stone walls topped with snaky concertina wire, set off at
	intervals by looming guard towers. Over a hundred CONS are 
	in the yard. Playing catch, shooting craps, jawing at each 
	other, making deals. Exercise period. 



	RED emerges into fading daylight, slouches low-key through the 
	activity, worn cap on his head, exchanging hellos and doing 
	minor business. He's an important man here. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		There's a con like me in every prison 
		in America, I guess. I'm the guy who 
		can get it for you. Cigarettes, a 
		bag of reefer if you're partial, a 
		bottle of brandy to celebrate your 
		kid's high school graduation. Damn 
		near anything, within reason. 

	He slips somebody a pack of smokes, smooth sleight-of-hand.

				RED (V.O.) 
		Yes sir, I'm a regular Sears & 
		Roebuck. 

	TWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS issue from the main tower, drawing 
	everybody's attention to the loading dock. The outer gate 
	swings open...revealing a gray prison bus outside. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		So when Andy Dufresne came to me in 
		1949 and asked me to smuggle Rita 
		Hayworth into the prison for him, I 
		told him no problem. And it wasn't. 

				CON 
		Fresh fish! Fresh fish today! 

	Red is joined by HEYWOOD, SKEET, FLOYD, JIGGER, ERNIE, SNOOZE. 
	Most cons crowd to the fence to gawk and jeer, but Red and his 
	group mount the bleachers and settle in comfortably. 

11	INT -- PRISON BUS -- DUSK (1947) 11

	Andy sits in back, wearing steel collar and chains. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Andy came to Shawshank Prison in 
		early 1947 for murdering his wife 
		and the fella she was bangin'. 

	The bus lurches forward, RUMBLES through the gates. Andy gazes 
	around, swallowed by prison walls. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		On the outside, he'd been vice- 
		president of a large Portland bank. 
		Good work for a man as young as he 
		was, when you consider how 
		conservative banks were back then. 

				TOWER GUARD 
		All clear! 

	GUARDS approach the bus with carbines. The door jerks open. 
	The new fish disembark, chained together single-file, blinking 
	sourly at their surroundings. Andy stumbles against the MAN in 
	front of him, almost drags him down. 

	BYRON HADLEY, captain of the guard, slams his baton into 
	Andy's back. Andy goes to his knees, gasping in pain. JEERS 
	and SHOUTS from the spectators. 

				HADLEY 
		On your feet before I fuck you up 
		so bad you never walk again. 

13 	ON THE BLEACHERS 13

				RED 
		There they are, boys. The Human 
		Charm Bracelet. 

				HEYWOOD 
		Never seen such a sorry-lookin' 
		heap of maggot shit in my life. 

				JIGGER 
		Comin' from you, Heywood, you being 
		so pretty and all... 

				FLOYD 
		Takin' bets today, Red? 

				RED 
			(pulls notepad and pencil) 
		Bear Catholic? Pope shit in the woods? 
		Smokes or coin, bettor's choice. 

				FLOYD 
		Smokes. Put me down for two. 

				RED 
		High roller. Who's your horse? 

				FLOYD 
		That gangly sack of shit, third 
		from the front. He'll be the first. 

				HEYWOOD 
		Bullshit. I'll take that action. 

				ERNIE 
		Me too. 

	Other hands go up. Red jots the names. 

				HEYWOOD 
		You're out some smokes, son. Take 
		my word. 

				FLOYD 
		You're so smart, you call it. 

				HEYWOOD 
		I say that chubby fat-ass...let's 
		see...fifth from the front. Put me 
		down for a quarter deck. 

				RED 
		That's five cigarettes on Fat-Ass. 
		Any takers? 

	More hands go up. Andy and the others are paraded along, 
	forced by their chains to take tiny baby steps, flinching 
	under the barrage of jeers and shouts. The old-timers are 
	shaking the fence, trying to make the newcomers shit their 
	pants. Some of the new fish shout back, but mostly they look 
	terrified. Especially Andy. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		I must admit I didn't think much of 
		Andy first time I laid eyes on him. 
		He might'a been important on the 
		outside, but in here he was just a 
		little turd in prison grays. Looked 
		like a stiff breeze could blow him 
		over. That was my first impression 
		of the man. 

				SKEET 
		What say, Red? 

				RED 
		Little fella on the end. Definitely. 
		I stake half a pack. Any takers? 

				SNOOZE 
		Rich bet. 

				RED 
		C'mon, boys, who's gonna prove me 
		wrong? 
			(hands go up) 
		Floyd, Skeet, Joe, Heywood. Four brave 
		souls, ten smokes apiece. That's it, 
		gentlemen, this window's closed. 

	Red pockets his notepad. A VOICE comes over the P.A. speakers:

				VOICE (amplified) 
		Return to your cellblocks for 
		evening count. 

14	INT -- ADMITTING AREA -- DUSK (1947) 14

	The new fish are marched in. Guards unlock the shackles. The
	chains drop away, rattling to the stone floor. 

				HADLEY 
		Eyes front. 

	WARDEN SAMUEL NORTON strolls forth, a colorless man in a gray
	suit and a church pin in his lapel. He looks like he could 
	piss ice water. He appraises the newcomers with flinty eyes.

				NORTON 
		This is Mr. Hadley, captain of the 
		guard. I am Mr. Norton, the warden. 
		You are sinners and scum, that's 
		why they sent you to me. Rule 
		number one: no blaspheming. I'll 
		not have the Lord's name taken in 
		vain in my prison. The other rules 
		you'll figure out as you go along. 
		Any questions? 

				CON 
		When do we eat? 

	Cued by Norton's glance, Hadley steps up to the con and screams
	right in his face: 

				HADLEY 
		YOU EAT WHEN WE SAY YOU EAT! YOU 
		PISS WHEN WE SAY YOU PISS! YOU SHIT 
		WHEN WE SAY YOU SHIT! YOU SLEEP 
		WHEN WE SAY YOU SLEEP! YOU MAGGOT- 
		DICK MOTHERFUCKER! 

	Hadley rams the tip of his club into the con's belly. The 
	man falls to his knees, gasping and clutching himself. 
	Hadley takes his place at Norton's side again. Softly: 

				NORTON 
		Any other questions? 
			(there are none) 
		I believe in two things. Discipline 
		and the Bible. Here, you'll receive 
		both. 
			(holds up a Bible) 
		Put your faith in the Lord. Your 
		ass belongs to me. Welcome to 
		Shawshank. 

				HADLEY 
		Off with them clothes! And I didn't 
		say take all day doing it, did I? 

	The men shed their clothes. Within seconds, all stand naked. 

				HADLEY 
		First man into the shower! 

	Hadley shoves the FIRST CON into a steel cage open at the 
	front. TWO GUARDS open up with a fire hose. The con is slammed 
	against the back of the cage, sputtering and hollering. 
	Seconds later, the water is cut and the con yanked out. 

				HADLEY 
		Delouse that piece of shit! Next 
		man in! 

	The con gets a huge scoop of white delousing powder thrown all
	over him. Gasping and coughing, blinking powder from his eyes,
	he gets shoved to a trustee's cage. The TRUSTEE slides a short
	stack of items through the slot -- prison clothes and a Bible.
	All the men are processed quickly -- a blast of water, powder,
	clothes and a Bible... 

15	INT -- INFIRMARY -- NIGHT (1947) 15

	A naked CON steps before a DOCTOR and gets a cursory exam. 
	A penlight is shined in his eyes, ears, nose, and throat. 

				DOCTOR 
		Bend over. 

	The con does. A GUARD with a penlight in his teeth spreads his 
	cheeks, peers up his ass, and nods. Andy is next up. He gets 
	the same treatment. 


16	INT -- PRISON CHAPEL -- NIGHT (1947) 16

	CAMERA TRACKS the naked newcomers shivering on hard wooden 
	chairs, clothes on their laps, Bibles open. 

				CHAPLAIN (O.S.) 
		...maketh me to lie down in green 
		pastures. He leadeth me beside the 
		still waters. He restoreth my soul... 

17	INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1947) 17

	Three tiers to a side, concrete and steel, gray and imposing. 
	Andy and the others are marched in, still naked, carrying 
	their clothes and Bibles. The CONS in their cells greet them 
	with TAUNTS, JEERS, and LAUGHTER. One by one, the new men are 
	shown to their cells and locked in with a CLANG OF STEEL. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		The first night's the toughest, no 
		doubt about it. They march you in 
		naked as the day you're born, fresh 
		from a Bible reading, skin burning 
		and half-blind from that delousing 
		shit they throw on you... 

	Red watches from his cell, arms slung over the crossbars, 
	cigarette dangling from his fingers. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		...and when they put you in that 
		cell, when those bars slam home, 
		that's when you know it's for real. 
		Old life blown away in the blink of 
		an eye...a long cold season in hell 
		stretching out ahead...nothing 
		left but all the time in the world 
		to think about it. 

	Red listens to the CLANGING below. He watches Andy and a few 
	others being brought up to the 2nd tier. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Most new fish come close to madness 
		the first night. Somebody always 
		breaks down crying. Happens every 
		time. The only question is, who's 
		it gonna be? 

	Andy is led past and given a cell at the end of the tier. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		It's as good a thing to bet on as 
		any, I guess. I had my money on 
		Andy Dufresne... 

18	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 18

	The bars slam home. Andy is alone in his cell, clutching his 
	clothes. He gazes around at his new surroundings, taking it 
	in. He slowly begins to dress himself... 

19	EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- NIGHT (1947) 19

	A malignant stone growth on the Maine landscape. The moon 
	hangs low and baleful in a dead sky. The headlight of a 
	PASSING TRAIN cuts through the night. 

20	INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 20

	Red lies on his bunk below us, tossing his baseball toward the 
	ceiling and catching it again. He pauses, listening. FOOTSTEPS 
	approach below, unhurried, echoing hollowly on stone. 

21	INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1947) 21

	LOW ANGLE. A CELLBLOCK GUARD strolls into frame. 

				GUARD 
		That's lights out! Good night, ladies. 

	The lights bump off in sequence. The guard exits, footsteps
	echoing away. Darkness now. Silence. CAMERA CRANES UP the 
	tiers toward Red's cell. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		I remember my first night. Seems a 
		long time ago now. 

	Red looms from the darkness, leans on the bars. Listens. 
	Waits. From somewhere below comes faint, ghastly tittering.
	VOICES drift through the cellblock, taunting: 

				VARIOUS VOICES (O.S.) 
		Fishee fishee fisheeee...You're 
		gonna like it here, new fish. A 
		whooole lot...Make you wish your 
		daddies never dicked your 
		mommies...You takin' this down, new 
		fish? Gonna be a quiz later. 
			(somebody LAUGHS) 
		Sshhh. Keep it down. The screws'll 
		hear...Fishee fishee fisheeee... 

				RED (V.O.) 
		The boys always go fishin' with 
		first-timers...and they don't quit 
		till they reel someone in. 

	The VOICES keep on, sly and creepy in the dark... 

22	INT -- VARIOUS CELLS -- NIGHT (1947) 22
	thru thru 25
	2g ...while the new cons go quietly crazy in their cells. One man
	paces like a caged animal...another sits gnawing his cuticles
	bloody...a third is weeping silently...a fourth is dry-heaving
	into the toilet... 

26	INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 26

	Red waits at the bars. Smoking. Listening. He cranes his head,
	peers down toward Andy's cell. Nothing. Not a peep. 

				HEYWOOD (O.S.) 
		Fat-Ass...oh, Faaaat-Ass. Talk to 
		me, boy. I know you're in there. I 
		can hear you breathin'. Now don't 
		you listen to these nitwits, hear? 

27	INT -- FAT-ASS' CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 27

	Fat-Ass is crying, trying not to hyperventilate. 

				HEYWOOD (O.S.) 
		This ain't such a bad place. I'll 
		introduce you around, make you feel 
		right at home. I know some big ol' 
		bull queers who'd love to make your 
		acquaintance...especially that big 
		white mushy butt of yours... 

	And that's it. Fat-Ass lets out a LOUD WAIL of despair: 

				FAT-ASS 
		OH GOD! I DON'T BELONG HERE! I 
		WANNA GO HOME! 

28	INT -- HEYWOOD'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 28

				HEYWOOD 
		AND IT'S FAT-ASS BY A NOSE.' 

29	INT -- CELLBLOCK -- NIGHT (1947) 29

	The place goes nuts. Fat-Ass throws himself screaming against
	the bars. The entire block starts CHANTING: 

				VOICES 
		Fresh fish...fresh fish...fresh 
		fish...fresh fish... 

				FAT-ASS 
		I WANNA GO HOME! I WANT MY MOTHER.' 

				VOICE (O.S.) 
		I had your mother! She wasn't that 
		great! 

	The lights bump on. GUARDS pour in, led by Hadley himself.

				HADLEY 
		What the Christ is this happy shit? 

				VOICE (O.S.) 
		He took the Lord's name in vain! 
		I'm tellin' the warden! 

				HADLEY 
			(to the unseen wit) 
		You'll be tellin' him with my baton 
		up your ass! 

	Hadley arrives at Fat-Ass' cell, bellowing through the bars:

				HADLEY 
		What's your malfunction you fat 
		fuckin' barrel of monkey-spunk? 

				FAT-ASS 
		PLEASE! THIS AIN'T RIGHT! I AIN'T 
		SUPPOSED TO BE HERE! NOT ME! 

				HADLEY 
		I ain't gonna count to three! Not 
		even to one! Now shut the fuck up 
		'fore I sing you a lullabye! 

	Fat-Ass keeps blubbering and wailing. Total freak-out. Hadley 
	draws his baton, gestures to his men. Open it. 

	A GUARD unlocks the cell. Hadley pulls Fat-Ass out and starts 
	beating him with the baton, brutally raining blows. Fat-Ass 
	falls, tries to crawl. 

	The place goes dead silent. All we hear now is the dull
	THWACK-THWACK-THWACK of the baton. Fat-ass passes out. Hadley
	gets in a few more licks and finally stops. 

				HADLEY 
		Get this tub of shit down to the 
		infirmary. 
			(peers around) 
		If I hear so much as a mouse fart 
		in here the rest of the night, by 
		God and Sonny Jesus, you'll all 
		visit the infirmary. Every last 
		motherfucker here. 

	The guards wrestle Fat-Ass onto a stretcher and carry him off. 
	FOOTSTEPS echo away. Lights off. Darkness again. Silence. 

30	INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 30

	Red stares through the bars at the main floor below, eyes 
	riveted to the small puddle of blood where Fat-Ass went down. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		His first night in the joint, Andy 
		Dufresne cost me two packs of 
		cigarettes. He never made a sound... 

31	INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- MORNING (1947) 31

	LOUD BUZZER. The master locks are thrown -- KA-THUMP! The cons 
	step from their cells, lining the tiers. The GUARDS holler 
	their head-counts to the HEAD BULL, who jots on a clipboard. 
	Red peers at Andy, checking him out. Andy stands in line, 
	collar buttoned, hair combed. 

32	INT -- MESS HALL -- MORNING (1947) 32

	Andy goes through the breakfast line, gets a scoop of glop on
	his tray. WE PAN ANDY through the noise and confusion...and 
	discover BOGS DIAMOND and ROOSTER MacBRIDE watching Andy go 
	by. Bogs sizes Andy up with a salacious gleam in his eye, 
	mutters something to Rooster. Rooster laughs. 

	Andy finds a table occupied by Red and his regulars, chooses
	a spot at the end where nobody is sitting. Ignoring their 
	stares, he picks up his spoon -- and pauses, seeing something
	in his food. He carefully fishes it out with his fingers. 

	It's a squirming maggot. Andy grimaces, unsure what to do with
	it. BROOKS HATLEN is sitting closest to Andy. At age 65, he's
	a senior citizen, a long-standing resident. 

				BROOKS 
		You gonna eat that? 

				ANDY 
		Hadn't planned on it. 

				BROOKS 
		You mind? 

	Andy passes the maggot to Brooks. Brooks examines it, rolling
	it between his fingertips like a man checking out a fine 
	cigar. Andy is riveted with apprehension. 

				BROOKS 
		Mmm. Nice and ripe. 

	Andy can't bear to watch. Brooks opens up his sweater and 
	feeds the maggot to a baby crow nestled in an inside pocket.
	Andy breathes a sigh of relief. 

				BROOKS 
		Jake says thanks. Fell out of his 
		nest over by the plate shop. I'm 
		lookin' after him till he's old 
		enough to fly. 

	Andy nods, proceeds to eat. Carefully. Heywood approaches.

				JIGGER 
		Oh, Christ, here he comes. 

				HEYWOOD 
		Mornin', boys. It's a fine mornin'. 
		You know why it's fine? 

	Heywood plops his tray down, sits. The men start pulling out
	cigarettes and handing them down. 

				HEYWOOD 
		That's right, send 'em all down. I 
		wanna see 'em lined up in a row, 
		pretty as a chorus line. 

	An impressive pile forms. Heywood bends down and inhales
	deeply, smelling the aroma. Rapture. 

				FLOYD 
		Smell my ass... 

				HEYWOOD 
		Gee, Red. Terrible shame, your 
		horse comin' in last and all. 
		Hell, I sure do love that horse of 
		mine. I believe I owe that boy a 
		big sloppy kiss when I see him. 

				RED 
		Give him some'a your cigarettes 
		instead, cheap bastard. 

				HEYWOOD 
		Say Tyrell, you pull infirmary duty 
		this week? How's that winnin' horse 
		of mine, anyway? 

				TYRELL 
		Dead. 
			(the men fall silent) 
		Hadley busted his head pretty good. 
		Doc already went home for the 
		night. Poor bastard lay there till 
		this morning. By then... 

	He shakes his head, turns back to his food. The silence
	mounts. Heywood glances around. Men resume eating. Softly:

				ANDY 
		What was his name? 

				HEYWOOD 
		What? What'd you say? 

				ANDY 
		I was wondering if anyone knew his 
		name. 

				HEYWOOD 
		What the fuck you care, new fish? 
			(resumes eating) 
		Doesn't matter what his fuckin' 
		name was. He's dead. 

33	INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1947) 33

	A DEAFENING NOISE of industrial washers and presses. Andy works
	the laundry line. A nightmarish job. He's new at it. BOB, the
	con foreman, elbows him aside and shows him how it's done. 

34	INT -- SHOWERS -- DAY (1947) 34

	Shower heads mounted in bare concrete. Andy showers with a
	dozen or more men. No modesty here. At least the water is good
	and hot, soothing his tortured muscles. 

	Bogs looms from the billowing steam, smiling, checking Andy up
	and down. Rooster and PETE appear from the sides. The Sisters.

				BOGS 

	You're some sweet punk. You been 
	broke in yet? 

	Andy tries to step past them. He gets shoved around, nothing
	serious, just some slap and tickle. Jackals sizing up prey.

				BOGS 
		Hard to get. I like that. 

	Andy breaks free, flushed and shaking. He hurries off, leaving
	the three Sisters laughing. 

35	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 35

	Andy lies staring at the darkness, unable to sleep. 

36	EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- DAY (1947) 36

	Exercise period. Red plays catch with Heywood and Jigger, 
	lazily tossing a baseball around. Red notices Andy off to the
	side. Nods hello. Andy takes this as a cue to amble over. 
	Heywood and Jigger pause, watching. 

				ANDY 
			(offers his hand) 
		Hello. I'm Andy Dufresne. 

	Red glances at the hand, ignores it. The game continues.

				RED 
		The wife-killin' banker. 

				ANDY 
		How do you know that? 

				RED 
		I keep my ear to the ground. Why'd 
		you do it? 

				ANDY 
		I didn't, since you ask. 

				RED 
		Hell, you'll fit right in, then. 
			(off Andy's look) 
		Everyone's innocent in here, don't 
		you know that? Heywood! What are 
		you in for, boy? 

				HEYWOOD 
		Didn't do it! Lawyer fucked me! 

	Red gives Andy a look. See? 

				ANDY 
		What else have you heard? 

				RED 
		People say you're a cold fish. They 
		say you think your shit smells 
		sweeter than ordinary. That true? 


				ANDY 
		What do you think? 

				RED 
		Ain't made up my mind yet. 

	Heywood nudges Jigger. Watch this. He winds up and throws the
	ball hard -- right at Andy's head. Andy sees it coming out of
	the corner of his eye, whirls and catches it. Beat. He sends
	the ball right back, zinging it into Heywood's hands. Heywood
	drops the ball and grimaces, wringing his stung hands. 

				ANDY 
		I understand you're a man who knows 
		how to get things. 

				RED 
		I'm known to locate certain things 
		from time to time. They seem to 
		fall into my hands. Maybe it's 
		'cause I'm Irish. 

				ANDY 
		I wonder if you could get me a 
		rock-hammer? 

				RED 
		What is it and why? 

				ANDY 
		You make your customers' motives a 
		part of your business? 


				RED 
		If you wanted a toothbrush, I 
		wouldn't ask questions. I'd just 
		quote a price. A toothbrush, see, 
		is a non-lethal sort of object. 

				ANDY 
		Fair enough. A rock-hammer is about 
		eight or nine inches long. Looks 
		like a miniature pickaxe, with a 
		small sharp pick on one end, and a 
		blunt hammerhead on the other. It's 
		for rocks. 

				RED 
		Rocks. 

	Andy squats, motions Red to join him. Andy grabs a handful of
	dirt and sifts it through his hands. He finds a pebble and
	rubs it clean. It has a nice milky glow. He tosses it to Red.

				RED 
		Quartz? 

				ANDY 
		Quartz, sure. And look. Mica. Shale. 
		Silted granite. There's some graded 
		limestone, from when they cut this 
		place out of the hill. 

				RED 
		So? 

				ANDY 
		I'm a rockhound. At least I was, in 
		my old life. I'd like to be again, 
		on a limited scale. 

				RED 
		Yeah, that or maybe plant your toy 
		in somebody's skull? 

				ANDY 
		I have no enemies here. 

				RED 
		No? Just wait. 

	Red flicks his gaze past Andy. Bogs is watching them. 

				RED 
		Word gets around. The Sisters have 
		taken a real shine to you, yes they 
		have. Especially Bogs. 

				ANDY 
		Tell me something. Would it help if 
		I explained to them I'm not 
		homosexual? 

				RED 
		Neither are they. You have to be 
		human first. They don't qualify. 
			(off Andy's look) 
		Bull queers take by force, that's 
		all they want or understand. I'd 
		grow eyes in the back of my head if 
		I were you. 

				ANDY 
		Thanks for the advice. 

				RED 
		That comes free. But you understand 
		my concern. 

				ANDY 
		If there's trouble, I doubt a rock- 
		hammer will do me any good. 

				RED 
		Then I guess you wanna escape. 
		Tunnel under the wall maybe? 
			(Andy laughs politely) 
		I miss the joke. What's so funny? 

				ANDY 

	You'll know when you see the rock- 
	hammer. 

				RED 
		What's this item usually go for? 

				ANDY 
		Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.

				RED 
		My standard mark-up's twenty 
		percent, but we're talkin' about a 
		special object. Risk goes up, price 
		goes up. Call it ten bucks even. 

				ANDY 
		Ten it is. 

				RED 
		I'll see what I can do. 
			(rises, slapping dust) 
		But it's a waste of money. 

				ANDY 
		Oh? 

				RED 
		Folks who run this place love 
		surprise inspections. They turn a 
		blind eye to some things, but not 
		a gadget like that. They'll find 
		it, and you'll lose it. Mention my 
		name, we'll never do business 
		again. Not for a pair of shoelaces 
		or a stick of gum. 

				ANDY 
		I understand. Thank you, Mr...? 

				RED 
		Red. The name's Red. 

				ANDY 
		Red. I'm Andy. Pleasure doing 
		business with you. 

	They shake. Andy strolls off. Red watches him go. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		I could see why some of the boys 
		took him for snobby. He had a quiet 
		way about him, a walk and a talk 
		that just wasn't normal around 
		here. He strolled. like a man in a 
		park without a care or worry. Like 
		he had on an invisible coat that 
		would shield him from this place. 
			(resumes playing catch) 
		Yes, I think it would be fair to 
		say I liked Andy from the start. 

37	INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1947) 37

	Red gets his breakfast and heads for a table. Andy falls in
	step, slips him a tightly-folded square of paper. 

38	INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 38

	Lying on his bunk, Red unfolds the square. A ten dollar bill.

				RED (V.O.) 
		He was a man who adapted fast. 

39	EXT -- LOADING DOCK -- DAY (1947) 39

	Under watchful supervision, CONS are off-loading bags of dirty
	laundry from an "Eliot Nursing Home" truck. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Years later, I found out he'd 
		brought in quite a bit more than 
		just ten dollars... 

	A certain bag hits the ground. The TRUCK DRIVER shoots a look 
	at a black con, LEONARD, then ambles over to a GUARD to shoot 
	the shit. Leonard loads the bag onto a cart... 

40	INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1947) 40

	Bags are being unloaded. We find Leonard working the line. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		When they check you into this 
		hotel, one of the bellhops bends 
		you over and looks up your works, 
		just to make sure you're not 
		carrying anything. But a truly 
		determined man can get an object 
		quite a ways up there. 

	Leonard slips a small paper-wrapped package out of the laundry 
	bag, hides it under his apron, and keeps sorting... 

4l	INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY EXCHANGE -- DAY (1947) 41

	Red deposits his dirty bundle and moves down the line to where 
	the clean sheets are being handed out. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		That's how Andy joined our happy 
		little Shawshank family with more 
		than five hundred dollars on his 
		person. Determination. 

	Leonard catches Red's eye, turns and grabs a specific stack of 
	clean sheets. He hands it across to Red -- 

	TIGHT ANGLE 

	-- and more than clean laundry changes hands. Two packs of
	cigarettes slide out of Red's hand into Leonard's. 

42	INT -- RED'S CELL -- DAY (1947) 42

	Red slips the package out of his sheets, carefully checks to 
	make sure nobody's coming, then rips it open. He pulls out the 
	rock-hammer. It's just as Andy described. Red laughs softly. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Andy was right. I finally got the 
		joke. It would take a man about six 
		hundred years to tunnel under the 
		wall with one of these. 

43	INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- 2ND TIER -- NIGHT (1947) 43

	Brooks Hatlen pushes a cart of books from cell to cell. The 
	rolling library. He finds Red waiting for him. Red slips the 
	rock-hammer, wrapped in a towel, through the bars and onto the
	cart. Next comes six cigarettes to pay for postage. 

				RED 

	Dufresne. 

	Brooks nods, never missing a beat. He rolls his cart to 
	Andy's cell, mutters through the bars: 

				BROOKS 
		Middle shelf, wrapped in a towel. 

	Andy's hand snakes through the bars and makes the object 
	disappear. The hand comes back and deposits a small slip of 
	folded paper along with more cigarettes. Brooks turns his cart
	around and goes back. He pauses, sorting his books long enough
	for Red to snag the slip of paper. Brooks continues on, 
	scooping the cigarettes off the cart and into his pocket. 

44	INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 44

	Red unfolds the slip of paper. Penciled neatly on it is a 
	single word: "Thanks." 

45	INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1947) 45

	We are assaulted by the deafening noise of the laundry line. 
	Andy is doing his job, getting good at it. 

				BOB 
		DUFRESNE! WE'RE LOW ON HEXLITE! 
		HEAD ON BACK AND FETCH US UP SOME! 

	Andy nods. He leaves the line, weaving his way through the 
	laundry room and into -- 

46	INT -- BACK ROOMS/STOCK AREA -- DAY (1947) 46

	-- a dark, tangled maze of rooms and corridors, boilers and
	furnaces, sump pumps, old washing machines, pallets of 
	cleaning supplies and detergents, you name it. Andy hefts a 
	cardboard drum of Hexlite off the stack, turns around -- 

	-- and finds Bogs Diamond in the aisle. blocking his way.
	Rooster looms from the shadows to his right, Pete Verness
	on the left. A frozen beat. Andy slams the Hexlite to the
	floor, rips off the top, and scoops out a double handful.

				ANDY 
		You get this in your eyes, it 
		blinds you. 

				BOGS 
		Honey, hush. 

	Andy backs up, holding them at bay, trying to maneuver through 
	the maze. The Sisters keep coming, tense and guarded, eyes 
	riveted and gauging his every move, trying to outflank him. 
	Andy trips on some old gaint sugglies. That's all it takes. 
	They're on him in an instant, kicking and stomping. 

	Andy gets yanked to his feet. Bogs applies a chokehold from 
	behind. They propel him across the room and slam him against 
	an old four-pocket machine, bending him over it. Rooster jams 
	a rag into Andy's mouth and secures it with a steel pipe, like 
	a horse bit. Andy kicks and struggles, but Rooster and Pete 
	have his arms firmly pinned. Bogs whispers in Andy's ear: 

				BOGS 
		That's it, fight. Better that way. 

	Andy starts screaming, muffled by the rag. CAMERA PULLS BACK, 
	SLOWLY WIDENING. The big Washex blocks our view. All we see 
	is Andy's screaming face and the men holding him down... 

	...and CAMERA DRIFTS FROM THE ROOM, leaving the dark place 
	and the dingy act behind...MOVING up empty corridors, past 
	concrete walls and steel pipes... 

				RED (V.O.) 
		I wish I could tell you that Andy 
		fought the good fight, and the 
		Sisters let him be. I wish I could 
		tell you that, but prison is no 
		fairy-tale world. 

	WE EMERGE into the prison laundry past a guard, WIDENING for 
	a final view of the line. The giant steel "mangler" is 
	slapping down in brutal rhythm. The sound is deafening. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		He never said who did it...but we 
		all knew. 

	PRISON MONTAGE: (1947 through 1949) 

47 	ANDY PLODS THROUGH HIS DAYS. WORKING. EATING. CHIPPING AND 47
	shaping his rocks after lights-out... 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Things went on like that for a 
		while. Prison life consists of 
		routine, and then more routine. 

48 	ANDY WALKS THE YARD, FACE SWOLLEN AND BRUISED. 48 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Every so often, Andy would show up 
		with fresh bruises. 

49 	ANDY EATS BREAKFAST. A FEW TABLES OVER, BOGS BLOWS HIM A KISS. 49

				RED (V.O.) 
		The Sisters kept at him. Sometimes 
		he was able to fight them off... 
		sometimes not. 

50 	ANDY BACKS INTO A CORNER IN SOME DINGY PART OF THE PRISON, 
	wildly swinging a rake at his tormentors. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		He always fought, that's what I 
		remember. He fought because he knew 
		if he didn't fight, it would make 
		it that much easier not to fight 
		the next time. 

	The rake connects, snapping off over somebody's skull. They 
	beat the hell out of him. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Half the time it landed him in the 
		infirmary... 


51	INT -- SOLITARY CONFINEMENT ("THE HOLE") -- NIGHT (1949) 51 

	A stone closet. No bed, sink, or lights. Just a toilet with no 
	seat. Andy sits on bare concrete, bruised face lit by a faint 
	ray of light falling through the tiny slit in the steel door. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		...the other half, it landed him in 
		solitary. Warden Norton's "grain & 
		drain" vacation. Bread, water, and 
		all the privacy you could want. 

52	INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1949) 52

	Andy is working the line. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		And that's how it went for Andy. That 
		was his routine. I do believe those 
		first two years were the worst for 
		him. And I also believe if things 
		had gone on that way, this place 
		would have got the best of him. 
		But then, in the spring of 1949, 
		the powers-that-be decided that... 

53	EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1949) 53

	Warden Norton addresses the assembled cons via bullhorn: 

				NORTON 
		...the roof of the license-plate 
		factory needs resurfacing. I need a 
		dozen volunteers for a week's work. 
		We're gonna be taking names in this 
		steel bucket here... 

	Red glances around at his friends. Andy also catches his eye.

				RED (V.O.) 
		It was outdoor detail, and May is 
		one damn fine month to be workin' 
		outdoors. 

54	EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1949) 54

	Cons shuffle past, dropping slips of paper into a bucket. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		More than a hundred men volunteered 
		for the job. 

	Red saunters to a guard named TIM YOUNGBLOOD, mutters 
	discreetly in his ear. 

55	EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1949) 55

	Youngblood is pulling names and reading them off. Red 
	exchanges grins with Andy and the others. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Wouldn't you know it? Me and some 
		fellas I know were among the names 
		called. 

56	INT -- PRISON CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (1949) 56

	Red slips Youngblood six packs of cigarettes. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Only cost us a pack of smokes per 
		man. I made my usual twenty 
		percent, of course. 

57	EXT -- LICENSE PLATE FACTORY -- DAY (1949) 57

	A tar-cooker bubbles and smokes. TWO CONS dip up a bucket of
	tar and tie a rope to the handle. The rope goes taught. CAMERA
	FOLLOWS the bucket of tar up the side of the building to -- 

58 	THE ROOF 58

	-- where it is relayed to the work detail. the men are dipping
	big Padd brushes and spreading the tar. ANGLZ OVER to Byron 
	Hadley bitching sourly to his fellow guards: 

				HADLEY 
		...so this shithead lawyer calls 
		long distance from Texas, and he 
		says, Byron Hadley? I say, yeah. He 
		says, sorry to inform you, but your 
		brother just died. 

				YOUNGBLOOD 
		Damn, Byron. Sorry to hear that. 

				HADLEY 
		I ain't. He was an asshole. Run off 
		years ago, family ain't heard of him 
		since. Figured him for dead anyway. 
		So this lawyer prick says, your 
		brother died a rich man. Oil wells 
		and shit, close to a million bucks. 
		Jesus, it's frigging incredible how 
		lucky some assholes can get. 

				TROUT 
		A million bucks? Jeez-Louise! You 
		get any of that? 

				HADLEY 
		Thirty five thousand. That's what 
		he left me. 

				TROUT 
		Dollars? Holy shit, that's great! 
		Like winnin' a lottery... 
			(off Hadley's shitty look) 
		...ain't it? 

				HADLEY 
		Dumbshit. What do you figger the 
		government's gonna do to me? Take a 
		big wet bite out of my ass, is what. 

				TROUT 
		Oh. Hadn't thought of that. 

				HADLEY 
		Maybe leave me enough to buy a new 
		car with. Then what happens? You 
		pay tax on the car. Repairs and 
		maintenance. Goddamn kids pesterin' 
		you to take 'em for a ride... 

				MERT 
		And drive it, if they're old enough. 

				HADLEY 
		That's right, wanting to drive it, 
		wanting to learn on it, f'Chrissake! 
		Then at the end of the year, if you 
		figured the tax wrong, they make 
		you pay out of your own pocket. 
		Uncle Sam puts his hand in your 
		shirt and squeezes your tit till 
		it's purple. Always get the short 
		end. That's a fact. 
			(spits over the side) 
		Some brother. Shit. 

	The prisoners keep spreading tar, eyes on their work. 

				HEYWOOD 
		Poor Byron. What terrible fuckin' 
		luck. Imagine inheriting thirty 
		five thousand dollars. 

				RED 
		Crying shame. Some folks got it 
		awful bad. 

	Red glances over -- and is shocked to see Andy standing up,
	listening to the guards talk. 

				RED 
		Hey, you nuts? Keep your eyes on 
		your pail! 

	Andy tosses his Padd in the bucket and strolls toward Hadley.

				RED 
		Andy! Come back! Shit! 

				SNOOZE 
		What's he doing? 

				FLOYD 
		Gettin' himself killed. 

				RED 
		God damn it... 

				HEYWOOD 
		Just keep spreadin' tar... 

	The guards stiffen at Andy's approach. Youngblood's hand goes
	to his holster. The tower guards CLICK-CLACK their rifle 
	bolts. Hadley turns, stupefied to find Andy there. 

				ANDY 
		Mr. Hadley. Do you trust your wife? 

				HADLEY 
		That's funny. You're gonna look 
		funnier suckin' my dick with no 
		fuckin' teeth. 

				ANDY 
		What I mean is, do you think she'd 
		go behind your back? Try to 
		hamstring you? 

				HADLEY 
		That's it! Step aside, Mert. This 
		fucker's havin' hisself an accident. 

	Hadley grabs Andy's collar and propels him violently toward
	the edge of the roof. The cons furiously keep spreading tar.

				HEYWOOD 
		Oh God, he's gonna do it, he's 
		gonna throw him off the roof... 

				SNOOZE 
		Oh shit, oh fuck, oh Jesus... 

				ANDY 
		Because if you do trust her, there's 
		no reason in the world you can't 
		keep every cent of that money. 

	Hadley abruptly jerks Andy to a stop right at the edge. In 
	fact, Andy's past the edge, beyond his balance, shoetips 
	scraping the roof. The only thing between him and an ugly drop
	to the concrete is Hadley's grip on the front of his shirt.

				HADLEY 
		You better start making sense. 

				ANDY 
		If you want to keep that money, all 
		of it, just give it to your wife. 
		See, the IRS allows you a one-time- 
		only gift to your spouse. It's good 
		up to sixty thousand dollars. 

				HADLEY 
		Naw, that ain't right! Tax free? 

				ANDY 
		Tax free. IRS can't touch one cent. 

	The cons are pausing work, stunned by this business discussion.

				HADLEY 
		You're the smart banker what shot 
		his wife. Why should I believe a 
		smart banker like you? So's I can 
		wind up in here with you? 

				ANDY 
		It's perfectly legal. Go ask the 
		IRS, they'll say the same thing. 
		Actually, I feel silly telling you 
		all this. I'm sure you would have 
		investigated the matter yourself. 

				HADLEY 
		Fuckin'-A. I don't need no smart 
		wife-killin' banker to show me where 
		the bear shit in the buckwheat. 

				ANDY 
		Of course not. But you will need 
		somebody to set up the tax-free 
		gift, and that'll cost you. A 
		lawyer, for example... 

				HADLEY 
		Ambulance-chaaing, highway-robbing 
		cocksuckers! 

				ANDY 
		...or come to think of it, I 
		suppose I could set it up for you. 
		That would save you some money. 
		I'll write down the forms you need, 
		you can pick them up, and I'll 
		prepare them for your signature... 
		nearly free of charge. 
			(off Hadley's look) 
		I'd only ask three beers apiece for 
		my co-workers, if that seems fair. 

				TROUT 
			(guffawing) 
		Co-workers! Get him! That's rich, 
		ain't it? Co-workers... 

	Hadley freezes him with a look. Andy presses on: 

				ANDY 
		I think a nan working outdoors 
		feels more like a man if he can 
		have a bottle of suds. That's only 
		my opinion. 

	The convicts stand gaping, all pretense of work gone. They
	look like they've been pole-axed. Hadley shoots them a look.

				HADLEY 
		What are you jimmies starin' at? 
		Back to work, goddamn it! 

59	EXT -- LICENSE PLATE FACTORY -- DAY (1949) 59

	As before, an object is hauled up the side of the building by
	rope -- only this time, it's a cooler of beer and ice. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		And that's how it came to pass, 
		that on the second-to-last day of 
		the job, the convict crew that 
		tarred the plate factory roof in 
		the spring of '49... 

60	EXT -- ROOF -- SHORTLY LATER (1949) 60

	The cons are taking the sun and drinking beer. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		...wound up sitting in a row at ten 
		o'clock in the morning, drinking icy 
		cold Black Label beer courtesy of 
		the hardest screw that ever walked 
		a turn at Shawshank State Prison. 

				HADLEY 
		Drink up, boys. While it's cold. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		The colossal prick even managed to 
		sound magnanimous. 

	Red knocks back another sip, enjoying the bitter cold on his
	tongue and the warm sun on face. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		We sat and drank with the sun on 
		our shoulders, and felt like free 
		men. We could'a been tarring the 




	roof of one of our own houses. We 
	were the Lords of all Creation. 

	He glances over to Andy squatting apart from the others.

				RED (V.O.) 
		As for Andy, he spent that break 
		hunkered in the shade, a strange 
		little smile on his face, watching 
		us drink his beer. 

				HEYWOOD 
			(approaches with a beer) 
		Here's a cold one, Andy. 

				ANDY 
		No thanks. I gave up drinking. 

	Heywood drifts back to others, giving them a look. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		You could argue he'd done it to 
		curry favor with the guards. Or 
		maybe make a few friends among us 
		cons. Me, I think he did it just to 
		feel normal again...if only for a 
		short while. 

61	EXT -- PRISON YARD -- THE BLEACHERS -- DAY (1949) 61

	Andy and Red play checkers. Red makes his move. 

				RED 
		King me. 

				ANDY 
		Chess. Now there's a game of kings. 
		Civilized...strategic... 

				RED 
		...and totally fuckin' 
		inexplicable. Hate that game. 

				ANDY 
		Maybe you'll let me teach you 
		someday. I've been thinking of 
		getting a board together. 

				RED 
		You come to the right place. I'm 
		the man who can get things. 

				ANDY 
		We might do business on a board. But 
		the pieces, I'd like to carve those 
		myself. One side done in quartz... 
		the opposing side in limestone. 

				RED 
		That'd take you years. 

				ANDY 
		Years I've got. What I don't have 
		are the rocks. Pickings here in the 
		exercise yard are pretty slim. 

				RED 
		How's that rock-hammer workin' out 
		anyway? Scratch your name on your 
		wall yet? 

				ANDY 
			(smiles) 
		Not yet. I suppose I should. 

				RED 
		Andy? I guess we're gettin' to be 
		friends, ain't we? 

				ANDY 
		I suppose we are. 

				RED 
		I ask a question? Why'd you do it? 

				ANDY 
		I'm innocent, remember? Just like 
		everybody else here. 

	Red takes this as a gentle rebuff, keeps playing. 

				ANDY 
		What are you in for, Red? 

				RED 
		Murder. Same as you. 

				ANDY 
		Innocent? 

				RED 
		The only guilty man in Shawshank. 

62	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 62

	Andy lies in his bunk after lights out, polishing a fragment 
	of quartz by the light of the moon. He pauses, glancing at 
	all the names scratched in the wall. He rises, makes sure 
	the coast is clear, and starts scratching his name into the 
	cement with his rock-hammer, adding to the record. 

63 	RAY MILLAND 63

	fills the screen in glorious (and scratchy) black & white, 
	suffering a bad case of DT's... 

64	INT -- PRISON AUDITORIUM -- NIGHT (1949) 64

	...while a CONVICT AUDIENCE hoots and catcalls, talking back 
	to the screen. We find Red slouched in a folding chair, 
	watching the movie. Andy enters, backlit by the flickering 
	glare of the projector, and takes a seat next to him. 

				RED 
		Here's the good part. Bugs come out 
		of the walls to get his ass. 

				ANDY 
		I know. I've seen it three times 
		this month already. 

	Ray Milland starts SCREAMING. The entire audience SCREAMS with 
	him, high-pitched and hysterical. Andy fidgets. 

				ANDY 
		Can we talk business? 

				RED 
		Sure. What do you want? 

				ANDY 
		Rita Hayworth. Can you get her? 

				RED 
		No problem. Take a few weeks. 

				ANDY 
		Weeks? 

				RED 
		Don't have her stuffed down my 
		pants this very moment, sorry to 
		say. Relax. What are you so nervous 
		about? She's just a woman. 

	Andy nods, embarrassed. He gets up and hurries out. Red grins, 
	turns back to the movie. 

65	INT -- AUDITORIUM CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (1949) 65

	Andy exits the theater and freezes in his tracks. Two dark 
	figures loom in the corridor, blocking his path. Rooster and 
	Pete. Andy turns back -- and runs right into Bogs. Instant 
	bear hug. The Sisters are on him like a flash. They kick a 
	door open and drag him into -- 

66 	THE PROJECTION BOOTH 66

	-- where they confront the startled PROJECTIONIST, an old con
	blinking at them through thick bifocals. 

				BOGS 
		Take a walk. 

				PROJECTIONIST 
		I have to change reels. 

				BOGS 
		I said fuck off. 

	Terrified, the old man darts past and out the door. Pete slams 
	and locks it. Bogs shoves Andy to the center of the room. 

				ANDY 
		I know. I've seen it three times 
		this month already. 

	Ray Milland starts SCREAMING. The entire audience SCREAMS witt 
	him, high-pitched and hysterical. Andy fidgets. 

				ANDY 
		Can we talk business? 

				RED 
		Sure. What do you want? 

				ANDY 
		Rita Hayworth. Can you get her?

65	INT -- AUDITORIUM CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (1949) 65

	Andy exits the theater and freezes in his tracks. Two dark 
	figures loom in the corridor, blocking his path. Rooster and 
	Pete. Andy turns back -- and runs right into Bogs. Instant 
	bear hug. The Sisters are on him like a flash. They kick a

				BOGS 
		Take a walk. 

				PROJECTIONIST 
		I have to change reels. 

				BOGS 
		I said fuck off. 

	Terrified, the old man darts past and out the door. Pete slams 
	and locks it. Bogs shoves Andy to the center of the room. 

				BOGS 
		Ain't you gonna scream? 

	Andy sighs, cocks his head at the projector. 

				ANDY 
		They'd never hear me over that. 
		Let's get this over with. 

	Seemingly resigned, Andy turns around, leans on the rewind 
	bench -- and curls his fingers around a full 1.000 foot reel
	of 35mm film. Rooster licks his lips, pushes past the others.

				ROOSTER 
		Me first. 

				ANDY 
		Okay. 

	Andy whips the reel of film around in a vicious arc, smashing
	it into Rooster's face and bouncing him off the wall. 

				ROOSTER 
		Fuck! Shit! He broke my nose! 

	Andy fights like hell, but is soon overpowered and forced to his
	knees. Bogs steps to Andy, pulls out an awl with a vicious 
	eight-inch spike, gives him a good long look at it. 

				BOGS 
		Now I'm gonna open my fly, and 
		you're gonna swallow what I give 
		you to swallow. And when you 
		d mine, you gonna swallow 
		Rooster's. You done broke his nose, 
		so he ought to have somethin' to 
		show for it. 

				ANDY 
		Anything you put in my mouth, 
		you're going to lose. 

				BOGS 
		You don't understand. You do that, 
		I'll put all eight inches of this 
		steel ii your ear. 

				ANDY 
		Okay. But you should know that 
		sudden serious brain injury causes 
		the victim to bite down. Hard. 
			(faint smile) 
		In fact, I understand the bite-reflex 
		is so strong the victim's jaws have 
		to be pried open with a crowbar. 

	The Sisters consider this carefully. The film runs out of the 
	projector, flapping on the reel. The screen goes white. 

				BOGS 
		You little fuck. 

	Andy gets a bootheel in the face. The Sisters start kicking 
	and beating the living shit out of him with anything they can 
	get their hands on. In the theater, the convicts are CHANTING 
	AND CLAPPING for the movie to come back on. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's 
		mouth, and neither did his friends. 
		What they did do is beat him within 
		an inch of his life... 

67	INT -- INFIRMARY -- DAY (1949) 67

	Andy lies wrapped in bandages. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Andy spent a month in traction. 

68	INT -- SOLITARY CONFINEMENT -- DAY (1949) 68

				RED (V.O.) 
		Bogs spent a week in the hole. 

	Bogs sits on bare concrete. The steel door slides open. 

				GUARD 
		Time's up, Bogs. 

69	INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- 3RD TIER -- DUSK (1949) 69

	Bogs comes up the stairs, smoking a cigarette. Not many 
	cons around; the place is virtually deserted. A VOICE 
	echoes dimly over the P.A. system: 

				VOICE (O.S.) 
		Return to your cellblocks for 
		evening count. 

	Bogs enters his cell. Dark in here. He fumbles for the light 
	cord, yanks it. The sudden light reveals Captain Hadley six 
	inches from his face, waiting for him. Mert steps in behind 
	Bogs. hemming him. 

	Before Bogs can even open his mouth to say "what the fuck," 
	Hadley rams the tip of his baton brutally into his solar 
	plexus. Bogs doubles over, gagging his wind out. 

70 	GROUND FLOOR 70

	Ernie comes slowly around the corner, rolling a steel mop 
	cart loaded with supplies. 

71 	2ND TIER 71

	Red is darning a sock in his open cell. He pauses, frowning, 
	hearing strange THUMPING sounds. What the hell is that? 

72 	3RD TIER 72

	It's Hadley and Mert methodically and brutally pulping Bogs 
	with their batons, and kicking the shit out of him for good 
	measure. He feebly tries to ward them off. 

73 	2ND TIER 73

	Puzzled, Red steps from his cell, following the sound. It 
	dawns on him that it's coming from above. He moves to the 
	railing and leans out, craning around to look up -- 

74 	RED'S POV 74

	-- just as Bogs flips over the railing and comes sailing

	directly toward us, eyes bugging out, SCREAMING as he falls. 

75 	RED (SLOW MOTION) 75

	jumps back as Bogs plummets past, missing him by inches, arms 
	swimming and trying to grab the railing (but missing that 
	too), SCREAMING aaaaalll the way down -- 

76 	GROUND FLOOR 76

	-- and impacting on Ernie's gassing mop cart in an enormous 
	eruption of solvents and cleansers. The cart is squashed flat, 
	shooting out from under Bogs and skidding across the cellblock 
	floor like a tiddly wink, kicking up sparks for thirty yards. 
	Ernie is left gaping in shock at Bogs and all the Bogs-related 
	wreckage at his feet. 

77 	2ND TIER 77

	Red is stunned. He very tentatively leans out and looks up. 
	Above him, Hadley and Mert lean on the 3rd tier railing. 
	Hadley tilts the cap back on his head, shakes his head. 

				MERT 
		Damn, Byron. Look'a that. 

				HADLEY 
		Poor fella must'a tripped. 

	A tiny drop of blood drips off the toe of Hadley's shoe and 

	splashes across Red's upturned cheek. He wipes it off, then 
	looks down at Bogs. Cons and guards are racing to the scene. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Two things never happened again 
		after that. The Sisters never laid 
		a finger on Andy again... 

7B	EXT -- PRISON YARD/LOADING DOCK -- DAY (1949) 78

	Bogs, wheelchair-bound and wearing a neck brace, is loaded 
	onto an ambulance for transport. Behind the fence stand Red 
	and his friends, watching. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		...and Bogs never walked again. They 
		transferred him to a minimum security 
		hospital upstate. To my knowledge, 
		he lived out the rest of his days 
		drinking his food through a straw. 

				RED 
		I'm thinkin' Andy could use a nice 
		welcome back when he gets out of 
		the infirmary. 

				HEYWOOD 
		Sounds good to us. Figure we owe 
		him for the beer. 

				RED 
		Man likes to play chess. Let's get 
		him some rocks. 

79	EXT -- FIELD -- DAY (1949) 79

	A HUNDRED CONS at work. Hoes rise and fall in long waves. 
	GUARDS patrol on horseback. Heywood turns up a rocky chunk, 
	quickly shoves it down his pants. He maneuvers to Red and the 
	others, pulls out the chunk and shows it to them. 

				FLOYD 
		That ain't quartz. Nor limestone. 

				HEYWOOD 
		What are you, fuckin' geologist? 

				SNOOZE 
		He's right, it ain't. 

				HEYWOOD 
		What the hell is it then? 

				RED 
		Horse apple. 

				HEYWOOD 
		Bullshit. 

				RED 
		No, horse shit. Petrified. 

	Cackling, the men go back to work. Heywood stares at the rock.
	He crumbles it in his hands. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Despite a few hitches, the boys 
		came through in fine style... 

80	INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- BACK ROOM -- DAY (1949) 80

	A huge detergent box is filled with rocks, hidden in the 
	shadows behind a boiler furnace. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		...and by the week Andy was due 
		back, we had enough rocks saved up 
		to keep him busy till Rapture. 

	ANGLE SHIFTS to Red as he plops a bag of "laundry" on the 
	floor. Leonard and Bob toss a few more down. Red starts 
	pulling out contraband, giving them their commissions. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Also got a big shipment in that 
		week. Cigarettes, chewing gum, 
		shoelaces, playing cards with naked 
		ladies on 'em, you name it... 
			(pulls a cardboard tube) 
		...and, of course, the most 
		important item. 

81	INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1949) 81

	Andy, limping a bit, returns from the infirmary. Red watches 
	from his cell as Andy is brought up and locked away. 

82	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 82

	Andy finds the cardboard tube lying on his bunk. 

				GUARD (O.S.) 
		Lights out! 

	The lights go off. Andy opens the tube and pulls out a large 
	rolled poster. He lets it uncurl to the floor. A small scrap 
	of paper flutters out, landing at his feet. The poster is the
	famous Rita Hayworth pin-up -- one hand behind her head, eyes
	half closed, sulky lips parted. Andy picks up the scrap of 
	paper. It reads: "No charge. Welcome back." Alone in the dark,
	Andy smiles. 

83	INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- MORNING (1949) 83

	The BUZZER SOUNDS, the cells SLAM OPEN. Cons step from their
	cells. Andy catches Red's eye, nods his thanks. As the men 
	shuffle down to breakfast, Red glances into Andy's cell -- 

84 	RED'S POV -- DOLLYING PAST 84


	-- and sees Rita in her new place of honor on Andy's wall. 
	Sunlight casts a harsh barred shadow across her lovely face.

85	INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1949) 85

	Ernie is mopping the floor. He glances back and sees Warden 
	Norton approach the cellblock with an entourage of a DOZEN 
	GUARDS. Still mopping, Ernie mutters to the nearest cell: 

				ERNIE 
		Heads up. They're tossin' cells. 

	Word travels fast from cell to cell. Cons scramble to tidy up
	and hide things. Norton enters, nods to his men. The guards 
	pair off in all directions, making their choices at random. 

				GUARD 
		What kind'a contraband you hiding 
		in there, boy? 

	Cells are opened, occupants displaced, items scattered, 
	mattresses overturned. Whatever contraband is found gets 
	tossed out onto the cellblock floor. Mostly harmless stuff. 

	A GUARD pulls a sharpened screwdriver out of a mattress, 
	shoots a nasty look at the CON responsible. 

				NORTON 
		Solitary. A week. Make sure he 
		takes his Bible. 

				CON 
		Too goddamn dark to read down there.

				NORTON 
		Add another week for blasphemy. 

	The man is taken away. Norton's gaze goes up. 

				NORTON 
		Let's try the second tier. 

86 	2ND TIER 86

	Norton arrives, makes a thin show of picking a cell at random.
	He motions at Andy on his bunk, reading his Bible. The door is
	unlocked. Norton enters, trailed by his men. Andy rises. 

				ANDY 
		Good evening. 

	Norton gives a curt nod. Hadley and Trout start tossing the
	cell in a thorough search. Norton keeps his eyes on Andy,
	looking for a wrong glance or nervous blink. He takes the
	Bible out of Andy's hand. 

				NORTON 
		I'm pleased to see you reading 
		this. Any favorite passages? 


				ANDY 
		Watch ye therefore, for ye know not
		when the master of the house cometh. 

				NORTON 
			(smiles) 
		Luke. Chapter 13, verse 35. I've 
		always liked that one. 
			(strolls the cell) 
		But I prefer: "I am the light of 
		the world. He that followeth me 
		shall not walk in darkness, but 
		shall have the light of life." 

				ANDY 
		John. Chapter 8, verse 12. 

				NORTON 
		I hear you're good with numbers. 
		How nice. A man should have a skill. 

				HADLEY 
		You wanna explain this? 

	Andy glances over. Hadley is holding up a rock blanket, a
	polishing cloth roughly the size of an oven mitt. 

				ANDY 
		It's called a rock blanket. It's 
		for shaping and polishing rocks. 
		Little hobby of mine. 

	Hadley glances at the rocks lining the window sill, turns to
	Norton. 

				HADLEY 
		Looks pretty clean. Some contraband 
		here, nothing to get in a twist over. 

	Norton nods, strolls to the poster of Rita. 

				NORTON 
		I can't say I approve of this... 
			(turns to Andy) 
		...but I suppose exceptions can 
		always be made. 

	Norton exits, the guards follow. The cell door is slammed and
	locked. Norton pauses, turns back. 

				NORTON 
		I almost forgot. 

	He reaches through the bars and returns the Bible to Andy. 

				NORTON 
		I'd hate to deprive you of this. 
		Salvation lies within. 

	Norton and his men walk away. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Tossin' cells was just an excuse. 
		Truth is, Norton wanted to size 
		Andy up. 

87	INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1949) 87

	Andy is working the line. Hadley enters and confers briefly 
	with Bob. Bob nods, crosses to Andy, taps him. Andy turns, 
	removes an earplug. Bob shouts over the machine noise: 

				BOB 
		DUFRESNE! YOU'RE OFF THE LINE! 

88	INT -- WARDEN NORTON'S OFFICE -- DAY (1949) 88

	Andy is led in. Norton is at his desk doing paperwork. Andy's
	eyes go to a framed needle-point sampler on the wall behind 
	him that reads: "HIS JUDGMENT COMETH AND THAT RIGHT SOON." 

				NORTON 
		My wife made that in church group. 

				ANDY 
		It's very pretty, sir. 

				NORTON 
		You like working in the laundry? 

				ANDY 
		No, sir. Not especially. 

				NORTON 
		Perhaps we can find something more 
		befitting a man of your education. 

89	INT -- MAIN BUILDING -- STORAGE ROOMS -- DAY (1949) 89

	A series of bleak rooms stacked high with unused filing 
	cabinets, desks, paint supplies, etc. Andy enters. He hears a
	FLUTTER OF WINGS. An adult crow lands on a filing cabinet and
	struts back and forth, checking him out. Andy smiles. 

				ANDY 
		Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks? 

	Brooks Hatlen pokes his head out of the back room. 

				BROOKS 
		Andy! Thought I heard you out here! 

				ANDY 
		I've been reassigned to you. 

				BROOKS 
		I know, they told me. Ain't that a 
		kick in the ass? Come on in, I'll 
		give you the dime tour. 

90	INT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON LIBRARY -- DAY (1949) 90

	Brooks leads Andy into the bleakest back room of all. Rough
	plank shelves are lined with books. Brooks' private domain.

				BROOKS 
		Here she is, the Shawshank Prison 
		Library. Along this side, we got 
		the National Geographics. That 
		side, the Reader's Digest Condensed 
		books. Bottom shelf there, some 
		Louis L'Amours and Erle Stanley 
		Gardners. Every night I pile the 
		cart and make my rounds. I write 
		down the names on this clipboard 
		here. Well, that's it. Easy, peasy, 
		Japanesey. Any questions? 

	Andy pauses. Something about this doesn't make any sense.

				ANDY 
		Brooks? How long have you been 
		librarian? 

				BROOKS 
		Since 1912. Yuh, over 37 years. 

				ANDY 
		In all that time, have you ever had 
		an assistant? 

				BROOKS 
		Never needed one. Not much to it, 
		is there? 

				ANDY 
		So why now? Why me? 

				BROOKS 
		I dunno. Be nice to have some 
		comp'ny down here for a change. 

				HADLEY (O.S.) 
		Dufresne! 

91 	ANDY STEPS BACK INTO THE OUTER ROOMS AND FINDS HADLEY WITH 91
	another GUARD, a huge fellow named DEKINS. 

				HADLEY 
		That's him. That's the one. 

	Hadley exits. Dekins approaches Andy ominously. Andy stands 
	his ground, waiting for whatever comes next. Finally: 

				DEKINS 
		I'm Dekins. I been, uh, thinkin' 
		'bout maybe settin' up some kinda 
		trust fund for my kids' educations. 

	Andy covers his surprise. Glances at Brooks. Brooks smiles.

				ANDY 
		I see. Well. Why don't we have a 
		seat and talk it over? 

				BROOKS 
		Pull down one'a them desks there. 

	Andy and Dekins grab a desk standing on end and tilt it to the
	floor. They find chairs and settle in. Brooks returns with a 
	tablet of paper and a pen, slides them before Andy. 

				ANDY 
		What did you have in mind? A weekly 
		draw on your pay? 

				DEKINS 
		Yuh. I figured just stick it in the 
		bank, but Captain Hadley said check 
		with you first. 

				ANDY 
		He was right. You don't want your 
		money in a bank. 

				DEKINS 
		I don't? 

				ANDY 
		What's that gonna earn you? Two and 
		a half, three percent a year? We 
		can do a lot better than that. 
			(wets his pen) 
		So tell me, Mr. Dekins. Where do 
		you want to send your kids? 
		Harvard? Yale? 

92	INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1949) 92

				FLOYD 
		He didn't say that! 

				BROOKS 
		God is my witness. And Dekins, he 
		just blinks for a second, then 
		laughs his ass off. Afterward, he 
		actually shook Andy's hand. 

				HEYWOOD 
		My ass! 

				BROOKS 
		Shook his fuckin' hand. Just about 
		shit myself. All Andy needed was a 
		suit and tie, a jiggly little hula 
		girl on his desk, he would'a been 
		Mister Dufresne, if you please. 

				RED 
		Makin' yourself some friends, Andy. 

				ANDY 
		I wouldn't say "friends." I'm a 
		convicted murderer who provides 
		sound financial planning. That's a 
		wonderful pet to have. 

				RED 
		Got you out of the laundry, didn't 
		it? 

				ANDY 
		Maybe it can do more than that. 
			(off their looks) 
		How about expanding the library? 
		Get some new books in there. 

				HEYWOOD 
		How you 'spect to do that, "Mr. 
		Dufresne-if-you-please?" 

				ANDY 
		Ask the warden for funds. 

	LAUGHTER all around. Andy blinks at them. 

				BROOKS 
		Son, I've had six wardens through 
		here during my tenure, and I have 
		learned one great immutable truth 
		of the universe: ain't one of 'em 
		been born whose asshole don't 
		pucker up tight as a snare drum 
		when you ask for funds. 

93	INT -- MAIN BUILDING HALLWAY -- DAY (1949) 93

	DOLLYING Norton and Andy up the hall: 

				NORTON 
		Not a dime. My budget's stretched 
		thin as it is. 

				ANDY 
		I see. Perhaps I could write to the 
		State Senate and request funds 
		directly from them. 

				NORTON 
		Far as them Republican boys in 
		Augusta are concerned, there's only 
		three ways to spend the taxpayer's 
		hard-earned when it come to prisons. 
		More walls. More bars. More guards. 

				ANDY 
		Still, I'd like to try, with your 
		permission. I'll send a letter a 
		week. They can't ignore me forever. 

				NORTON 
		They sure can, but you write your 
		letters if it makes you happy. I'll 
		even mail 'em for you, how's that? 

94	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 94

	Andy is on his bunk, writing a letter. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		So Andy started writing a letter a 
		week, just like he said. 

95	INT -- GUARD DESK/NORTON'S OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1949) 95

	Andy pops his head in. The GUARD shakes his head. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		And just like Norton said, Andy got 
		no answers. But still he kept on. 

96	INT -- PRISON LIBRARY/ANDY'S OFFICE -- DAY (1950) 96

	Andy is doing taxes. Mert Entwhistle is seated across from
	him. Other off-duty guards are waiting their turn. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		The following April, Andy did tax 
		returns for half the guards at 
		Shawshank. 

97	INT -- PRISON LIBRARY -- ONE YEAR LATER (1951) 97

	Tax time again. Even more guards are waiting. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Year after that, he did them all... 
		including the warden's. 

98	EXT -- BASEBALL DIAMOND -- DAY (1952) 98

	A BATTER in a "Noresby Marauders" baseball uniform WHACKS the
	ball high into left field and races for first. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Year after that, they rescheduled 
		the start of the intramural season 
		to coincide with tax season... 

99	INT -- PRISON LIBRARY/ANDY'S OFFICE -- DAY (1952) 99

	The Batter sits across from Andy. The line winds out the door.

				RED (V.O.) 
		The guards on the opposing teams 
		all remembered to bring their W-2's. 

				ANDY 
		Moresby Prison issued you that gun, 
		but you actually had to pay for it? 

				THE BATTER 
		Damn right, and the holster too. 

				ANDY 
		See, that's all deductible. You get 
		to write that off. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Yes sir, Andy was a regular H&R 
		Block. In fact, he got so busy at 
		tax time, he was allowed a staff. 

	ANGLE SHIFTS to reveal Red and Brooks doing filing chores. 

				ANDY 
		Say Red, could you hand me a stack 
		of those 1040s? 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Got me out of the wood shop a month 
		out of the year, and that was fine 
		by me. 

100	INT -- GUARD DESK/NORTON'S OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1953) 100

	Andy enters and drops a letter on the outgoing stack. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		And still he kept sending those 
		letters... 

101	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1953) 101

	Dark. Andy's in his bunk, polishing a four-inch length of 
	quartz. It's a beautifully-crafted chess piece in the shape of 
	a horse's head, poise and nobility captured in gleaming stone. 

	He puts the knight on a chess board by his bed, adding it to 
	four pieces already there: a king, a queen, and two bishops. 
	He turns to Rita. Moonlight casts bars across her face. 

102	EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- DAY (1954) 102

	Floyd runs into the yard, scared and winded. He finds Andy and 
	Red on the bleachers. 

				FLOYD 
		Red? Andy? It's Brooks. 

103	INT -- PRISON LIBRARY/ANDY'S OFFICE -- DAY (1954) 103

	Floyd rushes in with Andy and Red at his heels. They find 
	Jigger and Snooze trying to calm Brooks, who has Heywood in a 
	chokehold and a knife to his throat. Heywood is terrified. 

				JIGGER 
		C'mon, Brooksie, why don't you just 
		calm the fuck down, okay? 

				BROOKS 
		Goddamn miserable puke-eatin' sons 
		of whores! 

	He kicks a table over. Tax files explode through the air. 

				RED 
		What the hell's going on? 

				SNOOZE 
		You tell me, man. One second he was 
		fine, then out came the knife. I 
		better get the guards. 

				RED 
		No. We'll handle this. Ain't that 
		right, Brooks? Just settle down and 
		we'll talk about it, okay? 

				BROOKS 
		Nothing left to talk about! It's all 
		talked out! Nothing left now but to 
		cut his fuckin' throat! 

				RED 
		Why? What's Heywood done to you? 

				BROOKS 
		That's what they want! It's the 
		price I gotta pay! 

	Andy steps forward, rivets Brooks with a gaze. Softly: 

				ANDY 
		Brooks, you're not going to hurt 
		Heywood, we all know that. Even 
		Heywood knows it, right Heywood? 

				HEYWOOD 
			(nods, terrified) 
		Sure. I know that. Sure. 

				ANDY 
		Why? Ask anyone, they'll tell you. 
		Brooks Hatlen is a reasonable man. 

				RED 
			(cuing nods all around) 
		Yeah, that's right. That's what 
		everybody says. 

				ANDY 
		You're not fooling anybody, so just 
		put the damn knife down and stop 
		scaring the shit out of people. 

				BROOKS 
		But it's the only way they'll let 
		me stay. 

	Brooks bursts into tears. The storm is over. Heywood staggers
	free, gasping for air. Andy takes the knife, passes it to Red.
	Brooks dissolves into Andy's arms with great heaving sobs.

				ANDY 
		Take it easy. You'll be all right. 

				HEYWOOD 
		Him? What about me? Crazy old 
		fool! Goddamn near slit my throat! 

				RED 
		You've had worse from shaving. 
		What'd you do to set him off? 

				HEYWOOD 
		Nothin'! Just came in to say 
		fare-thee-well. 
			(off their looks) 
		Ain't you heard? His parole came 
		through! 

	Red and Andy exchange a surprised look. Andy wants to 
	understand. Red just motions to let it be for now. He puts his
	arm around Brooks, who sobs inconsolably. Softly: 

				RED 

	Ain't that bad, old hoss. Won't be 
	long till you're squiring pretty 
	young girls on your arm and telling 
	'em lies. 

104	EXT -- PRISON YARD BLEACHERS -- DUSK (1954) 104

				ANDY 
		I just don't understand what 
		happened in there, that's all. 

				HEYWOOD 
		Old man's crazy as a rat in a tin 
		shithouse, is what. 

				RED 
		Heywood, enough. Ain't nothing 
		wrong with Brooksie. He's just 
		institutionalized, that's all. 

				HEYWOOD 
		Institutionalized, my ass. 

				RED 
		Man's been here fifty years. This 
		place is all he knows. In here, 
		he's an important man, an educated 
		man. A librarian. Out there, he's 
		nothing but a used-up old con with 
		arthritis in both hands. Couldn't 
		even get a library card if he 
		applied. You see what I'm saying? 

				FLOYD 
		Red, I do believe you're talking 
		out of your ass. 

				RED 
		Believe what you want. These walls 
		are funny. First you hate 'em, then 
		you get used to 'em. After long 
		enough, you get so you depend on 
		'em. That's "institutionalized." 

				JIGGER 
		Shit. I could never get that way. 

				ERNIE 
			(softly) 
		Say that when you been inside as 
		long as Brooks has. 

				RED 
		Goddamn right. They send you here 
		for life, and that's just what they 
		take. Part that counts, anyway. 

105	EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- DAWN (1954) 105

	The sun rises over gray stone. 

106	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- DAWN (1954) 106

	ANGLE ON RITA POSTER. Sexy as ever. The rising sun sends 
	fingers of rosy light creeping across her face. 

107	INT -- LIBRARY -- DAWN (1954) 107

	Brooks stands on a chair, poised at the bars of a window, 
	cradling Jake in his hands. 

				BROOKS 
		I can't take care of you no more. 
		You go on now. You're free. 

	He tosses Jake through the bars. The crow flaps away. 

108	EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- MAIN GATE -- DAY (1954) 108

	TWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS herald the opening of the gate. It 
	swings hugely open, revealing Brooks standing in his cheap 
	suit, carrying a cheap bag, wearing a cheap hat. 

	Brooks walks out, tears streaming down his face. He looks 
	back. Red, Andy, and others stand at the inner fence, seeing 
	him off. The massive gate closes, wiping them from view. 

109	INT -- BUS -- DAY (1954) 109

	Brooks is riding the bus, clutching the seat before him, 
	gripped by terror of speed and motion. 

				BROOKS (V.O.) 
		Dear Fellas. I can't believe how 
		fast things move on the outside. 

110	EXT -- STREET -- PORTLAND, MAINE -- DAY (1954) 110

	Brooks looks like a kid trying to cross the street without his 
	parents. People and traffic a blur. 

				BROOKS (V.O.) 
		I saw an automobile once when I was 
		young. Now they're everywhere. 

111	EXT -- BREWSTER HOTEL -- DAY (1954) 111

	Brooks comes trudging up the sidewalk. He glances up as a 
	prop-driven airliner streaks in low overhead. 

				BROOKS (V.O.) 
		The world went and got itself in a 
		big damn hurry. 

	He arrives at the Brewster. It ain't much to look at. 



112	INT -- BREWSTER HOTEL -- DAY (1954) 112

	A WOMAN leads Brooks up the stairs toward the top floor. He 
	has trouble climbing so many stairs. 

				WOMAN 
		No music in your room after eight 
		p.m. No guests after nine. No 
		cooking except on the hotplate... 

				BROOKS (V.O.) 
		People even talk faster. And louder. 

113	INT -- BROOKS' ROOM -- DAY (1954) 113

	Brooks enters. The room is small, old, dingy. Heavy wooden 
	beams cross the ceiling. An arched window affords a view of 
	Congress Street. Traffic noise drifts in. Brooks sets his bag 
	down. He doesn't quite know what to do. He just stands there, 
	like a man waiting for a bus. 

				BROOKS (V.O.) 
		The parole board got me into this 
		halfway house called the Brewster, 
		and a job bagging groceries at the 
		Foodway... 

114	INT -- FOODWAY MARKET -- DAY (1954) 114

	Loud. Jangling with PEOPLE and NOISE. Brooks is bagging 
	groceries. Registers are humming, kids are shrieking. 

				WOMAN 
		Make sure he double-bags. Last time 
		your man didn't double-bag and the 
		bottom near came out. 

				MANAGER 
		You double-bag like the lady says, 
		understand? 

				BROOKS 
		Yes sir, double-bag, surely will. 

				BROOKS (V.O.) 
		It's hard work. I try to keep up, 
		but my hands hurt most of the time. 
		I don't think the store manager 
		likes me very much. 

115	EXT -- PARK -- DAY (1954) 115

	Brooks sits alone on a bench, feeding pigeons. 

				BROOKS (V.O.) 
		Sometimes after work I go to the 
		park and feed the birds. I keep 
		thinking Jake might show up and say 
		hello, but he never does. I hope 
		wherever he is, he's doing okay and 
		making new friends. 

116	INT -- BROOKS' ROOM -- NIGHT (1954) 116

	Dark. Traffic outside. Brooks wakes up. Disoriented. Afraid.
	Somewhere in the night, a LOUD ARGUMENT is taking place. 

				BROOKS (V.O.) 
		I have trouble sleeping at night. 
		The bed is too big. I have bad 
		dreams, like I'm falling. I wake 
		up scared. Sometimes it takes me a 
		while to remember where I am. 

117	INT -- FOODWAY -- DAY (1954) 117

				BROOKS (V.O.) 
		Maybe I should get me a gun and rob 
		the Foodway, so they'd send me home. 
		I could shoot the manager while I 
		was at it, sort of like a bonus. 

118	INT -- BROOKS' ROOM -- DAY (1954) 118

	Brooks is packing his worldly possessions into the carry bag. 
	Undershirts, socks, etc. 

				BROOKS (V.O.) 
		But I guess I'm too old for that 
		sort of nonsense anymore. 

119	INT -- BROOKS' ROOM -- SHORTLY LATER (1954) 119

	Brooks is dressed in his suit. He finishes knotting his tie, 
	puts his hat on his head. The letter lies on the desk, stampe3 
	and ready for mailing. His bag is by the door. 

				BROOKS (V.O.) 
		I don't like it here. I'm tired of 
		being afraid all the time. I've 
		decided not to stay. 

	He takes one last look around. Only one thing left to do. He 
	steps to a wooden chair in the center of the room, pulls out s 
	pocketknife, and glances up at the ceiling beam. 

	He steps up onto the chair. It wobbles queasily. Now facing
	the beam, he carves a message into the wood: "Brooks Hatlen
	was here." He smiles with a sort of inner peace. 

				BROOKS (V.O.) 
		I doubt they'll kick up any fuss. 
		Not for an old crook like me. 

120 	TIGHT ON CHAIR 120

	His weight shifts on the wobbly chair -- and it goes out 
	from under him. His feet remain where they are, kicking feebly 
	in mid-air. His hat falls to the floor. 

	ANGLE WIDENS. Brooks has hanged himself. He swings gently, 
	facing the open window. Traffic noise floats up from below. 

121	EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- SHAWSHANK -- DAY (1954) 121

	Andy reads the letter to Red and the others: 

				ANDY 
		P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry I put a 
		knife to his throat. No hard feelings. 

	A long silence. Andy folds the letter, puts it away. Softly: 

				RED 
		He should'a died in here, goddamn it. 

122	INT -- PRISON LIBRARY -- DAY (1954) 122

	Andy is sorting books on the cart. He replaces a stack on the
	shelf -- and pauses, noticing a line of ants crawling up the
	wood. He glances up. The ants disappear over the top. He pulls
	a chair over and stands on it, peers cautiously over. 

				ANDY 
		Red! 

	Red steps in with an armload of files. Andy gingerly reaches
	in, grabs a black feathered wing, and pulls out a dead crow.

				RED 
			(softly) 
		Is that Jake? 

123	INT -- WOOD SHOP -- DAY (1954) 123

	Red is making something at his bench, sanding and planing. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		It never would have occurred to us, 
		if not for Andy. It was his idea. 
		We all agreed it was the right 
		thing to do... 

124	EXT -- FIELDS -- DAY (1954) 124

	Low hilly terrain all around. A HUNDRED CONS are at work in 
	the fields. GUARDS patrol with carbines, keeping a sharp eye.
	We find Andy, Red, and the boys working with picks and 
	shovels. They glance over to the pickup truck. Hadley's 
	chewing the fat with Mert and Youngblood. A WHISTLE BLOWS. 

				GUARD 
		Water break! Five minutes! 

	The work stops. Cons head for the pickup truck, where water is
	dispensed with dipper and pail. Red and the boys look to Andy.
	Andy nods. Now's the time. The group moves off through the 
	confusion, using it as cover. They head up the slope of a 
	nearby hill and quickly decide on a suitable spot. The 
	guards haven't noticed. 

	Jigger and Floyd start swinging picks into the soft earth, 
	quickly ripping out a hole. Red reaches into his jacket and 
	pulls out a beautiful wooden box, carefully stained and 
	varnished. He shows it around to nods of approval. 

				ANDY 
		That's real pretty, Red. Nice work. 

				HEYWOOD 
		Shovel man in. Watch the dirt. 

124 	CONTINUED 124
	Heywood jumps in and starts spading out the hole. 

125 	BY THE TRUCK 125

	Youngblood glances up and sees the men on the slope. 

				YOUNGBLOOD 
		What the fuck. 

				HADLEY 
			(follows his gaze) 
		HEY.' YOU MEN UP THERE.' GET YOUR 
		ASSES OFF THAT SLOPE! 
			(works his rifle bolt) 
		YOU HAPPY ASSHOLES GONE DEAF? YOU 
		GOT FIVE SECONDS 'FORE I SHOOT 
		SOMEBODY! 

	Suddenly, other cons start breaking away in groups, dozens of
	them heading toward the slope. The guards look around. 

				HADLEY 
		What am I, talkin' to myself? 

126 	ON THE SLOPE 126

	Andy pulls a towel-wrapped bundle from his jacket and unfolds
	it. Jake. Andy lays him in the box, followed by Brook's 
	letter. Red places the casket in the hole. A moment of 
	silence. Andy gives Red with an encouraging nod. 

				RED 
		Lord. Brooks was a sinner. Jake was 
		just a crow. Neither was much to 
		look at. Both got institutionalized. 
		See what you can do for 'em. Amen. 

	Muttered "amens" all around. The boys shovel dirt onto the 
	small grave and tamp it down. 

127	INT -- SHAWSHANK CORRIDORS -- DAY (1955) 127

	RAPID DOLLY with Hadley. He's striding, pissed-off, a man on e
	mission. He straight-arms a door and emerges onto -- 

128	EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON WALL -- DAY (1955) 128

	-- the wall overlooking the exercise yard. He leans on the
	railing, scans the yard, sees Andy chatting with Red. 

				HADLEY 
		Dufresne! What the fuck did you do? 
			(Andy looks up) 
		Your ass, warden's office, now! 

	Andy shoots a worried look at Red, then heads off. 

129	INT -- GUARD DESK/WARDEN'S OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1955) 129

	Dozens of parcel boxes litter the floor. WILEY, the duty 
	guard, picks through them. Hadley enters, trailed by Andy.

				ANDY 
		What is all this? 

				HADLEY 
		You tell me, fuck-stick! They're 
		addressed to you, every damn one! 

	Wiley thrusts an envelope at Andy. Andy just stares at it.

				WILEY 
		Well, take it. 

	Andy takes the envelope, pulls out a letter, reads: 

				ANDY 
		Dear Mr. Dufresne. In response to
		your repeated inquiries, the State
		Senate has allocated the enclosed
		funds for your library project... "
			(stunned, examines check) 
		This is two hundred dollars. 

	Wiley grins. Hadley glares at him. The grin vanishes. 

				ANDY 
		In addition, the Library District
		has generously responded with a
		charitable donation of used books
		and sundries. We trust this will
		fill your needs. We now consider
		the matter closed. Please stop
		sending us letters. Yours truly,
		the State Comptroller's Office.

	Andy gazes around at the boxes. The riches of the world lay at
	his feet. His eyes mist with emotion at the sight. 

				HADLEY 
		I want all this cleared out before 
		the warden gets back, I shit you not. 

	Hadley exits. Andy touches the boxes like a love-struck man
	touching a beautiful woman. Wiley grins. 

				WILEY 
		Good for you, Andy. 

				ANDY 
		Only took six years. 
			(beat) 
		From now on, I send two letters a 
		week instead of one. 

				WILEY 
			(laughs, shakes his head) 
		I believe you're crazy enough. You 
		better get this stuff downstairs 
		like the Captain said. I'm gonna go 
		pinch a loaf. When I get back, this 
		is all gone, right? 

	Andy nods. Wiley disappears into the toilet, Jughead Comix in 
	hand. Alone now, Andy starts going through the boxes like a 
	starving man exploring packages of food. He doesn't know where 
	to turn first. He gets giddy, ripping boxes open and pulling 
	out books, touching them, smelling them. 

	He rips open another box. This one contains an old phonograph
	player, industrial gray and green, the words "Portland Public
	School District" stenciled on the side. The box also contains
	stacks and stacks of used record albums. 

	Andy reverently slips a stack from the box and starts flipping 
	through them. Used Nat King Coles, Bing Crosbys, etc. 
	He comes across a certain album -- Mozart's "Le Nozze de 
	Figaro." He pulls it from the stack, gazing upon it as a man 
	transfixed. It is a thing of beauty. It is the Grail. 

130	INT -- BATHROOM -- DAY (1955) 130

	Wiley sits in one of the stalls, Jughead comic on his knees. 

131	INT -- GUARD STATION/OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1955) 131

	Andy wrestles the phonograph player onto the guards' desk, 
	sweeping things onto the floor in his haste. He plugs the 
	machine in. A red light warms up. The platter starts spinning. 

	He slides the Mozart album from its sleeve, lays it on the 
	platter, and lowers the tone arm to his favorite cut. The 
	needle HISSES in the groove...and the MUSIC begins, lilting 
	and gorgeous. Andy sinks into Wiley's chair, overcome by its 
	beauty. It is "Deutino: Che soave zeffiretto," a duet sung by 

	Susanna and the Contessa. 

132	INT -- BATHROOM -- DAY (1955) 132

	Wiley pauses reading, puzzled. He thinks he hears music. 

				WILEY 
		Andy? You hear that? 

133	INT -- GUARD STATION/OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1955) 133

	Andy shoots a look at the bathroom...and smiles. Go for broke. 
	He lunges to his feet and barricades the front door, then the 
	bathroom. He returns to the desk and positions the P.A. 
	microphone. He works up his courage, then flicks all the 
	toggles to "on." A SQUEAL OF FEEDBACK echoes briefly... 

134 INT/EXT -- VARIOUS P.A. SPEAKERS -- DAY (1955) 134

	...and the Mozart is suddenly broadcast all over the prison. 

135	INT -- BATHROOM -- DAY (1955) 135

	Wiley lunges to his feet, pants tangling around his ankles. 

136 INT/EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- VARIOUS LOCATIONS -- DAY (1955) 136

	Cons all over the prison stop whatever they're doing, freezing 
	in mid-step to listen, gazing up at the speakers. 

137 	THE STAMPING MACHINES IN THE PLATE SHOP ARE SHUT DOWN... 137 

138 	THE LAUNDRY LINE GOES SILENT, GRINDING TO A HALT... 138

139 	THE WOOD SHOP MACHINES ARE TURNED OFF, BUZZING TO A STOP... 139

140 	THE MOTOR POOL...THE KITCHEN...THE LOADING DOCK...THE EXERCISE 140
	thru yard...the numbing routine of prison life itself...all grinds thru
143 	TO A STUTTERING HALT. NOBODY MOVES, NOBODY SPEAKS. EVERYBODY 143

	just stands in place, listening to the MUSIC, hypnotized. 

144	INT -- GUARD STATION -- DAY (1955) 144

	Andy is reclined in the chair, transported, arms fluidly 
	conducting the music. Ecstasy and rapture. Shawshank no 
	longer exists. It has been banished from the mind of men. 

145	EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- DAY (1955) 145

	CAMERA TRACKS along groups of men, all riveted. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		I have no idea to this day what 
		them two Italian ladies were 
		singin' about. Truth is, I don't 
		want to know. Some things are best 
		left unsaid. I like to think they 
		were singin' about something so 
		beautiful it can't be expressed in 
		words, and makes your heart ache 
		because of it. 

	CAMERA brings us to Red. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		I tell you, those voices soared. 
		Higher and farther than anybody in 
		a gray place dares to dream. It was 
		like some beautiful bird flapped 
		into our drab little cage and made 
		these walls dissolve away...and for 
		the briefest of moments -- every 
		last man at Shawshank felt free. 

146	INT -- PRISON CORRIDOR -- DAY (1955) 146

	FAST DOLLY with Norton striding up the hallway with Hadley.

		It pissed the warden off something 
		terrible. 

147	INT -- GUARD STATION/OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1955) 147

	Norton and Hadley break the door in. Andy looks up with a

				WILEY (O.S.) 
		LET ME OUUUUT! 

148	INT -- SOLITARY WING -- DAY (1955) 148

	LOW ANGLE SLOW PUSH IN on the massive, rust-streaked steel 
	door. God, this is a terrible place to be. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Andy got two weeks in the hole for 
		that little stunt. 

149	INT -- SOLITARY CONFINEMENT -- DAY (1955) 149

	Andy doesn't seem to mind. His arms sweep to the music still 
	playing in his head. We hear a FAINT ECHO of the soaring duet. 

150	INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1955) 1 50

				HEYWOOD 
		Couldn't play somethin' good, huh? 
		Hank Williams? 

				ANDY 
		They broke the door down before I 
		could take requests. 

				FLOYD 
		Was it worth two weeks in the hole? 

				ANDY 
		Easiest time I ever did. 

				HEYWOOD 
		Shit. No such thing as easy time in 
		the hole. A week seems like a year. 

				ANDY 
		I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company. 
		Hardly felt the time at all. 

				RED 
		Oh, they let you tote that record 
		player down there, huh? I could'a 
		swore they confiscated that stuff. 

				ANDY 
			(taps his heart, his head) 
		The music was here...and here. 
		That's the one thing they can't 
		confiscate, not ever. That's the 
		beauty of it. Haven't you ever felt 
		that way about music, Red? 

				RED 
		Played a mean harmonica as a younger 
		man. Lost my taste for it. Didn't 
		make much sense on the inside. 

				ANDY 
		Here's where it makes most sense. 
		We need it so we don't forget. 

				RED 
		Forget? 

				ANDY 
		That there are things in this world 
		not carved out of gray stone. That 
		there's a small place inside of us 
		they can never lock away, and that 
		place is called hope. 

				RED 
		Hope is a dangerous thing. Drive a 
		man insane. It's got no place here. 
		Better get used to the idea. 

				ANDY 
			(softly) 
		Like Brooks did? 

	FADE TO BLACK 

151 	AN IRON-BARRED DOOR 151

	slides open with an enormous CLANG. A stark room beyond. 
	CAMERA PUSHES through. SEVEN HUMORLESS MEN sit at a long 

	table. An empty chair faces them. We are again in: 

	INT -- SHAWSHANK HEARINGS ROOM -- DAY (1957) 

	Red enters, ten years older than when we first saw him at a 
	parole hearing. He removes his cap and sits. 

				MAN #l 
		It says here you've served thirty 
		years of a life sentence. 

				MAN #2 
		You feel you've been rehabilitated? 

				RED 
		Yes sir, without a doubt. I can say 
		I'm a changed man. No danger to 
		society, that's the God's honest 
		truth. Absolutely rehabilitated. 

	CLOSEUP -- PAROLE FORM 

	A big rubber stamp slams down: "REJECTED." 

152	EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DUSK (1957) 152

	Red emerges into fading daylight. Andy's waiting for him.

				RED 
		Same old, same old. Thirty years. 
		Jesus. When you say it like that... 

				ANDY 
		You wonder where it went. I wonder 
		where ten years went. 

	Red nods, solemn. They settle in on the bleachers. Andy pulls 
	a small box from his sweater, hands it to Red. 

				ANDY 
		Anniversary gift. Open it. 

	Red does. Inside the box, on a thin layer of cotton, is a 
	shiny new harmonica, bright aluminum and circus-red. 

				ANDY 
		Had to go through one of your 
		competitors. Hope you don't mind. 
		Wanted it to be a surprise. 

				RED 
		It's very pretty, Andy. Thank you. 

				ANDY 
		You gonna play something? 

	--

	Red considers it, shakes his head. Softly: 

				RED 
		Not today. 

153	INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE/ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1957) 153

	Men line the tiers as the evening count is completed. The 
	convicts step into their cells. The master switch is thrown 
	and all the doors slam shut -- KA-THUMP! Andy finds a 
	cardboard tube on his bunk. The note reads: "A new girl for 
	your 10 year anniversary. From your pal. Red." 

154	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- LATER (1957) 154

	Marilyn Monroe's face fills the screen. SLOW PULL BACK reveals
	the new poster: the famous shot from "The Seven Year Itch," 
	on the subway grate with skirt billowing up. Andy sits gazing 
	at her as lights-out commences... 

155	INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1957) 155

	...and we find Red gazing blankly as darkness takes the 
	cellblock. Adding up the months, weeks, days... 

	He regards the harmonica like a man confronted with a Martian 
	artifact. He considers trying it out -- even holds it briefly 
	to his lips, almost embarrassed -- but puts it back in its box
	untested. And there the harmonica will stay... 

	FADE TO BLACK 

156 	WE HOLD IN BLACKNESS as THUMPING SOUNDS grow louder... 156

				RED (V.O.) 
		Andy was as good as his word. He 
		kept writing to the State Senate. 
		Two letters a week instead of one. 

	...and the BLACKNESS disintegrates as a wall tumbles before 
	our eyes, revealing a WORK CREW with picks and sledgehammers, 
	faces obscured outlaw-style with kerchiefs against the dust. 
	Behind them are GUARDS overseeing the work. 

	Andy yanks his kerchief down, grinning in exhilaration. Red
	and the others follow suit. They step through the hole in the
	wall, exploring what used to be a sealed-off storage room. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		In 1959, the folks up Augusta way 
		finally clued in to the fact they 
		couldn't buy him off with just a 
		200 dollar check. Appropriations 
		Committee voted an annual payment of 
		500 dollars, just to shut him up. 

157	INT -- PRISON LIBRARY -- DAY (1960) 157

	TRACKING the construction. Walls have been knocked down. Men 
	are painting, plastering, hammering. Lots of shelves going up.
	Red is head carpenter. We find him discussing plans with Andy.

				RED (V.O.) 
		Those checks came once a year like 
		clockwork. 

158	INT -- PRISON LIBRARY -- DAY (1960) 158

	Red and the boys are opening boxes, pulling out books. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		You'd be amazed how far Andy could 
		stretch it. He made deals with book 
		clubs, charity groups...he bought 
		remaindered books by the pound... 

				HEYWOOD 
		Treasure Island. Robert Louis... 

				ANDY 
			(jotting) 
		...Stevenson. Next? 

				RED 
		I got here an auto repair manual, 
		and a book on soap carving. 

				ANDY 
		Trade skills and hobbies, those go 
		under educational. Stack right 
		behind you. 

				HEYWOOD 
		The Count of Monte Crisco... 

				FLOYD 
		Cristo, you dumbshit. 

				HEYWOOD 
		...by Alexandree Dumb-ass. 

				ANDY 
		Dumas. You boys'll like that one. 
		It's about a prison break. 

	Floyd tries to take the book. Heywood yanks it back. I saw it 
	first. Red shoots Andy a look. 

				RED 
		Maybe that should go under 
		educational too. 


159	INT -- WOOD SHOP -- DAY (1961) 159

	Red is making a sign, carefully routing letters into a long 
	plank of wood. It turns out to be -- 

160	INT -- PRISON LIBRARY -- DAY (1963) 160

	-- the varnished wood sign over the archway: "Brooks Hatlen 
	Memorial Library." TILT DOWN to reveal the library in all its 
	completed glory: shelves lined with books, tables and chairs, 
	even a few potted plants. Heywood is wearing headphones, 
	listening to Hank Williams on the record player. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		By the year Kennedy was shot, Andy 
		had transformed a broom closet 
		smelling of turpentine into the 
		best prison library in New England. 

161	EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- DAY (1963) 161

	FLASHBULBS POP as Norton addresses MEMBERS OF THE PRESS: 

				RED (V.O.) 
		That was also the year Warden Norton 
		instituted his famous "Inside-Out" 
		program. You may remember reading 
		about it. It made all the papers 
		and got his picture in LIFE magazine. 

				NORTON 
		...a genuine, progressive advance 
		in corrections and rehabilitation. 
		Our inmates, properly supervised, 
		will be put to work outside these 
		walls performing all manner of 
		public service. Cutting pulpwood, 
		repairing bridges and causeways, 
		digging storm drains... 

	ANGLE TO Red and the boys listening from behind the fence. 

				NORTON 
		These men can learn the value of an 
		honest day's labor while providing 
		a valuable service to the community 
		-- and at a bare minimum of expense
		to Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer! 

				HEYWOOD 
		Sounds like road-gangin', you ask me. 

				RED 
		Nobody asked you. 

162	EXT -- HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION SITE -- DAY (1963) 162

	A ROAD-GANG is grading a culvert with picks. There's dust and 
	the smell of sweat in the air. GUARDS patrol with sniper rifles,
	A pushy WOMAN REPORTER in an ugly hat bustles up the grade, 
	trailed by a PHOTOGRAPHER. 

				WOMAN REPORTER 
		You there! You men! We're gonna 
		take your picture now! 

				HEYWOOD 
		Give us a break, lady. 

				WOMAN REPORTER 
		Don't you know who I am? I'm from 
		LIFE magazine! I was told I'd get 
		some co-operation out here! You 
		want me to report you to your 
		warden? Is that what you want? 

				HEYWOOD 
			(sighs) 
		No, ma'am. 

				WOMAN REPORTER 
		That's more like it! Now I want you 
		all in a row with big bright smiles 
		on your faces! Grab hold of your 
		tools and show 'em to me! 

	She turns, motioning her photographer up the grade. Heywood 
	glances around at the other men. 

				HEYWOOD 
		You heard the lady. 

	Heywood unzips his pants, reaches inside. The others do 
	likewise. The woman turns back and is greeted by the sight of 
	a dozen men displaying their penises and smiling brightly. Her
	legs go wobbly and she sits heavily down on the dirt grade. 

				HEYWOOD 
		C'mon! We're showin' our tools and 
		grinnin' like fools! Take the damn 
		picture! 

163	INT -- SOLITARY CONFINZMENT -- NIGHT (1963) 163

	Heywood sits alone in the dark. He sighs. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		None of the inmates were invited to 
		express their views... 

164	EXT -- WOODED FIELDS -- DAY (1965) 164

	A ROAD-GANG is pulling stumps, bogged down in mud. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		'Course, Norton failed to mention 
		to the press that "bare minimum of 
		expense" is a fairly loose term. 
		There are a hundred different ways 
		to skim off the top. Men, 
		materials, you name it. And, oh my 
		Lord, how the money rolled in... 

	Norton strolls into view with NED GRIMES at his heels. 

				NED 
		This keeps up, you're gonna put me 
		out of business! With this pool of 
		slave labor you got, you can 
		underbid any contractor in town. 

				NORTON 
		Ned, we're providing a valuable 
		community service. 

				NED 
		That's fine for the papers, but I 
		got a family to feed. The State 
		don't pay my salary. Sam, we go 
		back a long way. I need this new 
		highway contract. I don't get it, I 
		go under. That's a fact. 
			(hands him a box) 
		Now you just have some'a this fine 
		pie my missus baked specially for 
		you, and you think about that. 

	Norton opens the box. Alongside the pie is an envelope. He
	runs his thumb across the thick stack of cash it contains.

	IN THE BACKGROUND, a winch cable SNAPS and whips through the
	air, damn near severing a man's leg. He goes down, screaming
	in mud and blood, pinned by a fallen tree stump. Men rush over
	to help him. Norton barely takes notice. 

				NORTON 
		Ned, I wouldn't worry too much over 
		this contract. Seems to me I've 
		already got my boys committed 
		elsewhere. You be sure and thank 
		Maisie for this fine pie. 

165	INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- NIGHT (1965) 165

	ANGLE on Maisie's pie. Several pieces gone. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		And behind every shady deal, behind 
		every dollar earned... 

	TILT UP to Andy at the desk, munching thoughtfully as he 
	totals up figures on an adding machine. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		...there was Andy, keeping the books. 

	Andy finishes preparing two bank deposits. Norton hovers near 
	the desk, keeping a watchful eye. 

				ANDY 
		Two deposits, Casco Bank and New 
		England First. Night drop, like 
		always. 

	Norton pockets the envelopes. Andy crosses to the wall safe 
	and shoves the ledger and sundry files inside. Norton locks 
	the safe, swings his wife's framed sampler back into place. He 
	cocks his thumb at some laundry and two suits in the corner. 

				NORTON 
		Get my stuff down t'laundry. Two 
		suits for dry-clean and a bag of 
		whatnot. Tell 'em if they over- 
		starch my shirts again, they're 
		gonna hear about it from me. 
			(adjusts his tie) 
		How do I look? 

				ANDY 
		Very nice. 

				NORTON 
		Big charity to-do up Portland 
		way. Governor's gonna be there. 
			(indicates pie) 
		Want the rest of that? Woman can't 
		bake worth shit. 

166	INT -- PRISON CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (1965) 166

	Andy trudges down the corridor with Norton's laundry, the pie 
	box under his arm. 

167	INT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1965) 167

	TILT UP FROM PIE to find Red munching away as he helps Andy 
	sort books on the shelves. 

				RED 
		Got his fingers in a lot of pies, 
		from what I hear. 

				ANDY 
		What you hear isn't half of it. 
		He's got scams you haven't dreamed 
		of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks. 
		There's a river of dirty money 
		flowing through this place. 

				RED 
		Money like that can be a problem. 
		Sooner or later you gotta explain 
		where it came from. 

				ANDY 
		That's where I come in. I channel 
		it, funnel it, filter it...stocks, 
		securities, tax free municipals... 
		I send that money out into the big 
		world. And when it comes back... 

				RED 
		It's clean as a virgin's whistle? 

				ANDY 
		Cleaner. By the time Norton retires, 
		I will have made him a millionaire. 

				RED 
		Jesus. They ever catch on, he's 
		gonna wind up wearing a number 
		himself. 

				ANDY 
			(smiles) 
		I thought you had more faith in me 
		than that. 

				RED 
		I'm sure you're good, but all that 
		paper leaves a trail. Anybody gets 
		too curious -- FBI, IRS, whatever -- 
		that trail's gonna lead to somebody. 

				ANDY 
		Sure it will. But not to me, and 
		certainly not to the warden. 

				RED 
		Who then? 

				ANDY 
		Peter Stevens. 

				RED 
		Who? 

				ANDY 
		The silent, silent partner. He's 
		the guilty one, your Honor. The man 
		with the bank accounts. That's 
		where the filtering process starts. 
		They trace it back, all they're 
		gonna find is him. 

				RED 
		Yeah, okay, but who the hell is he?

				ANDY 
		A phantom. An apparition. Second 
		cousin to Harvey the Rabbit. 
			(off Red's look) 
		I conjured him out of thin air. He 
		doesn't exist...except on paper. 

				RED 
		You can't just make a person up. 

				ANDY 
		Sure you can, if you know how the 
		system works, and where the cracks 
		are. It's amazing what you can 
		accomplish by mail. Mr. Stevens has 
		a birth certificate, social 
		security card, driver's license. 
		They ever track those accounts, 
		they'll wind up chasing a figment 
		of my imagination. 

				RED 
		Jesus. Did I say you were good? 
		You're Rembrandt. 

				ANDY 
		It's funny. On the outside, I was 
		an honest man. Straight as an 
		arrow. I had to come to prison to 
		be a crook. 

168	EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DUSK (1965) 

				RED 
		Does it ever bother you? 

				ANDY 
		I don't run the scams, Red, I just 
		process the profits. That's a fine 
		line, maybe. But I've also built 
		that library, and used it to help a 
		dozen guys get their high school 
		diplomas. Why do you think the 
		warden lets me do all that? 

				RED 
		To keep you happy and doing the 
		laundry. Money instead of sheets. 

				ANDY 
		I work cheap. That's the trade-off.

	Del Vikings on the soundtrack here. Maybe Jerry Lee Lewis.) 

				RED (V.O.)

		out on the limb... 

184	INT -- WOOD SHOP -- DAY (1965) 184

	Tommy intent on a paperback, mouthing the words. Behind him,
	wood is piling up on the conveyor belt. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		After a while, you couldn't pry 
		those books out of hands. 

				RED 
		Ass in gear, son! You're putting us 
		behind! 

	Tommy shoves the book in his back pocket and hurries over.

185	INT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1965) 185

	Tommy writes a sentence on the blackboard. Andy steps in, 
	shows him how to reconstruct it. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Before long, Andy started him on 
		his course requirements. He really 
		liked the kid, that was part of it. 
		Gave him a thrill to help a 
		youngster crawl off the shitheap. 
		But that wasn't the only reason... 

186	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 186

	TIGHT ANGLE on chessboard. Most of the pieces complete. PAN TO 
	Andy lying in his bunk, carefully polishing... 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Prison time is slow time. Sometimes 
		it feels like stop-time. So you do 
		what you can to keep going... 

	...and we keep going past Andy in a SLOW PAN of the cell. 
	Sink. Toilet. Books. Outside the window bars, we hear another 
	TRAIN passing in the night... 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Some fellas collect stamps. Others 
		build matchstick houses. Andy built 
		a library. Now he needed a new project. 
		Tommy was it. It was the same reason 
		he spent years shaping and polishing 
		those rocks. The same reason he hung 
		his fantasy girlies on the wall... 

	...STILL PANNING, past a chair, a sweater on a hook...and 
	finally to the place of honor on the wall... 

				RED (V.O.) 
		In prison, a man'll do most 
		anything to keep his mind occupied. 

	...where the latest poster turns out to be Racquel Welch ins

		exams...it was lovely Racquel. 

187	INT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1966) 187

	Tommy's taking the big test. Andy's monitoring the time. Deep 
	silence, save for Tommy's pencil-scribbling. A few old-timers 
	are browsing the shelves, sneaking looks their way. Tommy 
	tries to ignore them. Concentrate. 

	Andy clears his throat. Time's up. Tommy puts his pencil down, 

				ANDY 
		Well? 

				TOMMY 
		Well. It's for shit. 
			(gets up in disgust) 
		Wasted a whole fuckin' year of my 
		time with this bullshit! 

				ANDY 
		May not be as bad as you think. 

				TOMMY 
		It's worse! I didn't get a fuckin' 
		thing right! Might as well be in 
		Chinese! 

				ANDY 
		We'll see how the score comes out. 

				TOMMY 
		I'll tell you how the goddamn 
		score comes out... 

	Tommy grabs the test, wads it, slam-dunks it into the trash.

				TOMMY 
		Two points! Right there! There's 
		your goddamn score! 
			(storms out) 
		Goddamn cats crawlin' up trees, 5 
		times 5 is 25, fuck this place,

	Tommy is gone. Red and others stare. Andy gets up, pulls the 
	test from the trash, smoothes it out on the desk. 

188	INT -- WOOD SHOP -- DAY (1966) 188

	Rest break. Tommy and Red sipping Cokes. 

				TOMMY 
		I feel bad. I let him down. 

				RED 
		That's crap, son. He's proud of 
		you. Proud as a hen. 
			(off Tommy's look) 
		We been friends a long time. I know 
		him as good as anybody. 

				TOMMY 
		Smart fella, ain't he? 

				RED 
		Smart as they come. Used to be a 
		banker on the outside. 

				TOMMY 
		What's he in for anyway? 

				RED 
		Murder. 

				TOMMY 
		The hell you say. 

				RED 
		You wouldn't think, lookin' at him. 
		Caught his wife in bed with some 
		golf pro. Greased 'em both. C'mon, 
		boy, back to work... 

	SMASH! Red turns back. Tommy's Coke has slipped from his hand 
	and shattered on the floor. The kid's gone white as a sheet. 

				TOMMY 
			(bare whisper) 
		Oh my God... 

189	INT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1966) 189

	Tommy sits before Andy and Red: 

				TOMMY 
		'Bout four years ago, I was in 
		Thomaston on a 2 to 3 stretch. 
		Stole a car. Dumbfuck thing to do. 
			(beat) 
		Few months left to go, I get a new 
		cellmate in. Elmo Blatch. Big 
		twitchy fucker. Crazy eyes. Kind of 
		roomie you pray you don't get, know 
		what I'm sayin'? 6 to 12 for armed 
		burglary. Said he done hundreds of 
		jobs. Hard to believe, high-strung 
		as he was. Cut a loud fart, he'd go 
		three feet in the air. Talked all 
		the time, too, that's the other 
		thing. Never shut up. Places he'd 
		been, jobs he pulled, women he 
		fucked. Even people he killed. 
		People that gave him shit, that's 
		how he put it. One night, like a 
		joke, I say: "Yeah? Who'd you 
		kill?" So he says... 

				BLATCH 
		...I got me this job one time 
		bussin' tables at a country club. 
		So I could case all the big rich 
		pricks that come in. I pick out 
		this guy, go in one night and do 
		his place. He wakes up and gives 
		me shit. So I killed him. Him and 
		the tasty bitch he was with. 
			(starts laughing) 
		That's the best part! She's fuckin' 
		this prick, see, this golf pro, but 
		she's married to some other guy! 
		Some hotshot banker. He's the one 
		they pinned it on! They got him 
		down-Maine somewhere doin' time for 
		the crime! Ain't that choice? 

	He throws his head back and ROARS with laughter. 

191	INT -- PRISON LIBRARY -- DAY (1966) 191

	Silence. Tommy has finished his story. Red is stunned...but 
	Andy looks like he's been smacked with a two by four. 

				RED 
		Andy? 

	Andy says nothing. Walks stiffly away. Doesn't look back. 

192	INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 192

				NORTON 
		Well. I have to say, that's the 
		most amazing story I ever heard. 
		What amazes me most is you were 
		taken in by it. 

				ANDY 
		Sir? 

				NORTON 
		It's obvious this fellow Williams 
		is impressed with you. He hears 
		your tale of woe and quite 
		naturally wants to cheer you up. 
		He's young, not terribly bright. 
		Not surprising he didn't know what 
		a state he'd put you in. 

				ANDY 
		I think he's telling the truth. 

				NORTON 
		Let's say for a moment Blatch does 
		exist. You think he'd just fall to 
		his knees and cry, "Yes, I did it! 
		I confess! By all means, please add
		a life term to my sentence!" 

				ANDY 
		It wouldn't matter. With Tommy's 
		testimony, I can get a new trial. 

				NORTON 
		That's assuming Blatch is even 
		still there. Chances are excellent 
		he'd be released by now. Excellent.

				ANDY 
		They'd have his last known address.
		Names of relatives... 
			(Norton shakes his head)
		Well it's a chance. isn't it? How
		can you be so obtuse? 

				NORTON 
		What? What did you call me? 

				ANDY 
		Obtuse! Is it deliberate? The 
		country club will have his old time
		cards! W-2s with his name on them! 

				NORTON 
			(rises) 
		Dufresne, if you want to indulge 
		this fantasy, that's your business.
		Don't make it mine. This meeting's 
		over. 

				ANDY 
		Look, if it's the squeeze, don't 
		worry. I'd never say what goes on 
		in here. I'd be just as indictable 
		as you for laundering the money! 

				NORTON 
		Don't you ever mention money to me 
		again, you sorry son of a bitch! 
		Not in this office, not anywhere! 
			(slaps intercom) 
		Get in here! Now! 

				ANDY 
		I was just trying to rest your mind
		at ease, that's all. 

				NORTON 
			(as GUARDS enter) 
		Solitary! A month! 

	Andy gets dragged away, kicking and screaming: 

				ANDY 
		What's the matter with you? It's my 
		chance to get out, don't you see 
		that? It's my life! Don't you 
		understand it's my life? 

193	EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1966) 193

	Mail call. Men crowd around as names are called out. Red and
	the boys are parked on the bleachers. 

				FLOYD 
		A month in the hole. Longest damn 
		stretch I ever heard of. 

				TOMMY 
		It's my fault. 

				RED 
		Like hell. You didn't pull the 
		trigger, and you didn't convict him. 

				HEYWOOD 
		Red? You saying Andy's innocent? I 
		mean for real innocent? 
			(Red nods) 
		Sweet Jesus. How long's he been in 
		here? 

				RED 
		Since '47. Going on nineteen years. 

				MAIL CALLER 
		Thomas Williams! 

	Tommy raises his hand. The envelope gets tossed to him. He
	stares at it. Red peers over his shoulder. 

				RED 
		Board of Education. 

				TOMMY 
		The son of a bitch mailed it. 

				RED 
		Looks that way. You gonna open it 
		or stick your thumb up your butt? 

				TOMMY 
		Thumb up my butt sounds better. 

	He gets hemmed in by the older men. Red snatches the letter. 

				TOMMY 
		C'mon, just throw it away. Will you 
		please? Just throw it away? 

	Red rips it open, scans the letter. Expressionless. 

				RED 
		Well, shit. 

194	INT -- VISITOR'S ROOM -- DAY (1966) 194

	Tommy makes his way through the chaos, finds Beth and the baby 
	waiting behind the thick plexi shield. He sits, doesn't pick 
	up the phone. Just stares at Beth. She doesn't know what to 
	make of it. 

	He presses a piece of paper against the glass. A high school 
	diploma. Her face lights up, blinking back tears. 

195	INT -- SOLITARY WING -- NIGHT (1966) 195

	LOW ANGLE on steel door. Somewhere behind it, unseen, is Andy, 
	A rat scurries along the wall. FOOTSTEPS approach slowly. 

196	INT -- SOLITARY -- NIGHT (1966) 196

	Andy listens in darkness. The FOOTSTEPS pause outside his 
	door. The slot opens. An ELDERLY GUARD peers in. 

				ELDERLY GUARD 
		Kid passed. C-plus average. Thought 
		you'd like to know. 

	The slot closes. The FOOTSTEPS recede. Andy smiles. 

197	INT -- PRISON CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (1966) 197

	We find Tommy on evening work detail, mopping the floors with 
	bucket and pail. Mert Entwhistle comes into view. 

				MERT 
		Warden wants to talk. 

198	EXT -- PRISON -- NIGHT (1966) 198

	A steel door rattles open. Mert leads Tommy outside to a gate, 
	unlocks it. Tommy looks around. 

				TOMMY 
		Out here? 

				MERT 
		That's what the man said. 

	Mert swings the gate open, sends Tommy through, turns and 
	heads back inside. Tommy proceeds out across a loading-dock
	access for the shops and mills. Some vehicles parked. The 
	place is deserted. He stops, sensing a presence. 

				TOMMY 
		Warden? 

	Norton steps into the light. 

				NORTON 
		Tommy, we've got a situation here. 
		I think you can appreciate that. 

				TOMMY 
		Yes sir, I sure can. 

				NORTON 
		I tell you, son, this really came 
		along and knocked my wind out. It's 
		got me up nights, that's the truth. 

	Norton pulls a pack of cigarettes, offers Tommy a smoke. Tommy
	takes one. Norton lights both cigarettes, pockets his lighter.

				NORTON 
		The right decision. Sometimes it's 
		hard to figure out what that is. 
		You understand? 
			(Tommy nods) 
		Think hard, Tommy. If I'm gonna 
		move on this, there can't be the 
		least little shred of doubt. I have 
		to know if you what you told 
		Dufresne was the truth. 

				TOMMY 
		Yes sir. Absolutely. 

				NORTON 
		Would you be willing to swear before 
		a judge and jury...having placed 
		your hand on the Good Book and taken 
		an oath before Almighty God Himself? 

				TOMMY 
		Just gimme that chance. 

				NORTON 
		That's what I thought. 

	Norton drops his cigarette. Crushes it out with the toe of his 
	shoe. Glances up toward the plate shop roof as -- 

199 	HIGH ANGLE FROM PLATE SHOP ROOF (SNIPER POV) 199

	-- a rifle scope pops up into frame, jumping Tommy's image 
	into startling magnification, framed in the crosshairs.

	rapid-fires a carbine -- BLAM!BLAM!BLAM!BLAM! -- his face lit 
	up by the muzzle flashes. Captain Hadley. 

201 	TOMMY 201

	gets chewed to pieces by the gunfire. He smacks the ground in 
	a twitching, thrashing heap. Eyes wide and staring. Dead. 
	Surprise still stamped on his face. Silence now. Norton 
	turns, strolls into darkness. 

202	INT -- SOLITARY WING -- DAY (1966) 202

	GUARDS approach Andy's cell. The door is unlocked. Andy 
	emerges slowly, blinking painfully at the light. 

203 INT/EXT -- PRISON -- DAY (1966) 203

	Andy is marched along. Convicts stop to stare. 

204	INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 204

	Andy is led in. The door is closed. Alone with Norton. Softly, 

				NORTON 
		Terrible thing. Man that young, 
		less than a year to go, trying to 
		escape. Broke Captain Hadley's 
		heart to shoot him, truly it did. 

				ANDY 
		I'm done. It stops right now. Get 
		H&R Block to declare your income. 

	Norton lunges to his feet, eyes sparkling with rage. 

				NORTON 
		Nothing stops! NOTHING! 
			(tight) 
		Or you will do the hardest time 
		there is. No more protection from 
		the guards. I'll pull you out of 
		that one-bunk Hilton and put you in 
			(MORE) 

	-
				NORTON (cont.) 
		with the biggest bull queer I can 
		find. You'll think you got fucked 
		by a train! And the library? Gone! 
		Sealed off brick by brick! We'll 
		have us a little book-barbecue in 
		the yard! They'll see the flames 
		for miles! We'll dance around it 
		like wild Indians! Do you understand 
		me? Are you catching my drift? 

	SLOW PUSH IN on Andy's face. Eyes hollow. His beaten 
	expression says it all... 

205	EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1966) 205

	Red finds Andy sitting in the shadow of the high stone wall, 
	poking listlessly through the dust for small pebbles. Red 
	waits for some acknowledgment. Andy doesn't even look up. 
	Red hunkers down and joins him. Nothing is said for the 
	longest time. And then, softly: 

				ANDY 
		My wife used to say I'm a hard man 
		to know. Like a closed book. 
		Complained about it all the time. 
			(pause) 
		She was beautiful. I loved her. But 
		I guess I couldn't show it enough. 
			(softly) 
		I killed her, Red. 

	Andy finally glances to Red, seeking a reaction. Silence. 

				ANDY 
		I didn't pull the trigger. But I 
		drove her away. That's why she 
		died. Because of me, the way I am. 

				RED 
		That don't make you a murderer. Bad 
		husband, maybe. 

	Andy smiles faintly in spite of himself. Red gives his 

	shoulder a squeeze. 

				RED 
		Feel bad about it if you want. But 
		you didn't pull the trigger. 

				ANDY 
		No. I didn't. Someone else did, and 
		I wound up here. Bad luck, I guess. 

				RED 
		Bad luck? Jesus. 

				ANDY 
		It floats around. Has to land on 
		somebody. Say a storm comes 
		through. Some folks sit in their 
		living rooms and enjoy the rain. 
		The house next door gets torn out 
		of the ground and smashed flat. It 
		was my turn, that's all. I was in 
		the path of the tornado. 
			(softly) 
		I just had no idea the storm would 
		go on as long as it has. 
			(glances to him) 
		Think you'll ever get out of here? 

				RED 
		Sure. When I got a long white beard 
		and about three marbles left 
		rolling around upstairs. 

				ANDY 
		Tell you where I'd go. Zihuatanejo.

				RED 
		Zihuatanejo? 

				ANDY 
		Mexico. Little place right on the 
		Pacific. You know what the Mexicans 
		say about the Pacific? They say it 
		has no memory. That's where I'd 
		like to finish out my life, Red. A 
		warm place with no memory. Open a 
		little hotel right on the beach. 
		Buy some worthless old boat and fix 
		it up like new. Take my guests out 
		charter fishing. 
			(beat) 
		You know, a place like that, I'd 
		need a man who can get things. 

	Red stares at Andy, laughs. 

				RED 
		Jesus, Andy. I couldn't hack it on 
		the outside. Been in here too long. 
		I'm an institutional man now. Like 
		old Brooks Hatlen was. 

				ANDY 
		You underestimate yourself. 

	-

				RED 
		Bullshit. In here I'm the guy who 
		can get it for you. Out there, all 
		you need are Yellow Pages. I 
		wouldn't know where to begin. 
			(derisive snort) 
		Pacific Ocean? Hell. Like to scare 
		me to death, somethin' that big. 

				ANDY 
		Not me. I didn't shoot my wife and 
		I didn't shoot her lover, and 
		whatever mistakes I made I've paid 
		for and then some. That hotel and 
		that boat...I don't think it's too 
		much to want. To look at the stars 
		just after sunset. Touch the sand. 
		Wade in the water. Feel free. 

				RED 
		Goddamn it, Andy, stop! Don't do 
		that to yourself! Talking shitty 
		pipedreams! Mexico's down there, 
		and you're in here, and that's the 
		way it is! 

				ANDY 
		You're right. It's down there, and 
		I'm in here. I guess it comes down 
		to a simple choice, really. Get 
		busy living or get busy dying. 

	Red snaps a look. What the hell does that mean? Andy rises and
	walks away. Red lunges to his feet. 

				RED 
		Andy? 

				ANDY 
			(turns back) 
		Red, if you ever get out of here, 
		do me a favor. There's this big 
		hayfield up near Buxton. You know 
		where Buxton is? 

				RED 
			(nods) 
		Lots of hayfields there. 

				ANDY 
		One in particular. Got a long rock 
		wall with a big oak at the north 
		end. Like something out of a Robert 
		Frost poem. It's where I asked my 
			(MORE) 



				ANDY (cont.) 
		wife to marry me. We'd gone for a 
		picnic. We made love under that 
		tree. I asked and she said yes. 
			(beat) 
		Promise me, Red. If you ever get 
		out, find that spot. In the base of 
		that wall you'll find a rock that 
		has no earthly business in a Maine 
		hayfield. A piece of black volcanic 
		glass. You'll find something buried 
		under it I want you to have. 

				RED 
		What? What's buried there? 

				ANDY 
		You'll just have to pry up that 
		rock and see. 

	Andy turns and walks away.

		Lights out! 

	The lights bump off. He finishes polishing, holds up the piece 
	to admire. A pawn. He sets it down with the others -- and we 
	realize it's the final glance for the board. A full set. 

	He gazes up at Racquel and smiles. Pulls a six foot length of 
	rope from under his pillow. Lets it uncoil to the floor. 

214	INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 214

	Red sits in the dark, a bundle of nerves, trying to hold 

	himself still. He feels like he might scream or shake to 
	pieces. The seconds tick by, each an eternity. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		I have had some long nights in 
		stir. Alone in the dark with 
		nothing but your thoughts, time can 
		draw out like a blade... 

	A FLASH OF LIGHTNING outside his window sends harsh barred 
	shadows jittering across the cell. A storm breaking. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		That was the longest night of my 
		life... 

215	INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- MORNING (1966) 215

	KA-THUMP! The master lock is thrown. The cons emerge from 
	their cells and the headcount begins. Red looks back to see if 
	Andy's in line. He's not. Suddenly the count stalls: 

				GUARD 
		Man missing on tier two! Cell 12! 

	The head bull, HAIG, checks his list: 

				HAIG 
		Dufresne? Get your ass out here, 
		boy! You're holding up the show! 
			(no answer) 
		Don't make me come down there now! 
		I'll thump your skull for you! 

	Still no answer. Glaring, Haig stalks down the tier, clipboard 
	in hand. His men fall in behind. 

				HAIG 
		Dufresne, dammit, you're putting me 
		behind! You better be sick or dead 
		in there, I shit you not! 

	They arrive at bars. Their faces go slack. Stunned. Softly: 

				HAIG 

	Oh my Holy God. 

216 	REVERSE ANGLE 216

	reveals the cell is empty. Everything neat and tidy. Even the 
	bunk is stowed. They wrench the door open and rush in, tossing 
	the cell in a panic as if Andy might be lurking under the 
	Kleenex or the toothpaste. CAMERA ROCKETS IN on Haig as he 
	spins toward us, bellowing at the top of his lungs: 

				HAIG 
		WHAT THE FUCK! 

217	INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- MORNING (1966) 217

	Norton is kicking back with the morning paper. He notices ha
	dingy his shoes are. He glances at the shoebox on the desk. 
	kicks his shoes off, opens the box -- and gulls out Andy's o
	grimy work shoes. He stares blankly. What the fuck indeed. 

	An ALARM STARTS BLARING throughout the prison. He looks up. 

218	EXT -- PRISON -- DAY (1966) 218

	Norton and Hadley stride across the grounds, ALARM BLARING. 

				NORTON 
		I want every man on that cellblock 
		questioned! Start with that friend 
		of his! 

				HADLEY 
		who? 

219	INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- RED'S CELL -- DAY (1966) 219

	Red watches as Norton storms up with an entourage of guards.


				NORTON 
		Him. 

	Red's eyes widen. Guards yank him from his cell. 

220	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- DAY (1966) 220

	Norton steps to the center of the room, working himself up 
	into a fine rage: 

				NORTON 
		What do you mean "he just wasn't 
		here?" Don't say that to me, Haig! 
		Don't say that to me again! 

				HAIG 
		But sir! He wasn't! He isn't! 

				NORTON 
		I can see that, Haig! You think I'm 
		blind? Is that what you're saying? 
		Am I blind, Haig? 

				HAIG 
		No sir! 

	Norton grabs the clipboard and thrusts it at Hadley. 

				NORTON 
		What about you? You blind? Tell me 
		what this is! 

				HADLEY 
		Last night's count. 

				NORTON 
		You see Dufresne's name? I sure do! 
		Right there, see? "Dufresne." He 
		was in his cell at lights out! 
		Stands to reason he'd still be here 
		this morning! I want him found! Not 
		tomorrow, not after breakfast! Now! 

	Haig scurries out, gathering men. Norton spins to Red. 

				NORTON 
		Well? 

				RED 
		Well what? 

				NORTON 
		I see you two all the time, you're 
		thick as thieves, you are! He 
		must'a said something! 

				RED 
		No sir, he didn't! 

	Norton spreads his arms evangelist-style, spins slowly around.

				NORTON 
		Lord! It's a miracle! Man up and 
		vanished like a fart in the wind! 
		Nothin' left but some damn rocks on 
		the windowsill and that cupcake on 
		the wall! Let's ask her! Maybe she 
		knows! What say there, Fuzzy- 
		Britches? Feel like talking? Guess 
		not. Why should you be different? 

	Red exchanges looks with the guards. Even they're nervous. 
	Norton scoops a handful rocks off the sill. He hurls them at
	the wall one at a time, shattering them, punctuating his words:

				NORTON 
		It's a conspiracy! (SMASH) That's 
		what this is! (SMASH) It's one big 
		damn conspiracy! (SMASH) And 
		everyone's in on it! (SMASH) 
		Including her! 

	He sends the last rock whizzing right at Racquel. 
	No smash. 

	It takes a moment for this to sink in. All eyes go to her. The 
	rock went through her. There's a small hole in the poster 
	where her navel used to be. 

	You could hear a pin drop. Norton reaches up, sinks his finger 
	into the hole. He keeps pushing...and his entire hand 
	disappears into the wall. 

221 	ANGLE FROM BEHIND POSTER 221

	as Norton rips the poster from before our eyes. Stunned faces 
	peer in. CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK...to reveal the long 
	crumbling tunnel in the wall. 

222	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- MINUTES LATER (1966) 222

	RORY TREMONT, a guard barely out of his teens, tries not to 
	look nervous as they lash a rope around his chest. He's 
	getting instructions from six different people at once. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		They got this skinny kid named Rory 
		Tremont to go in the hole. He wasn't 
		much in the brains department, but 
		he possessed the one most important 
		qualification for the job... 
			(they slap a flashlight 
		in his hands) 
		...he was willing to go. 

223	INT -- TUNNEL -- DAY (1966) 223

	Rory squeezes down the tunnel on his belly. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Probably thought he'd win a Bronze 
		Star or something. 

224	INT -- VERTICAL SHAFT -- DAY (1966) 224

	Dark as midnight. Concrete walls rise on both sides. If you 
	imagine them as two huge slices of bread, the meat of this 
	particular sandwich is about three feet of airspace and a dark
	tangle of pipes between the cellblocks. Rory's appears, shining
	his flashlight down the shaft. Somewhere, a rat SQUEAKS. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		It was his third day on the job. 

				RORY 
		Warden? There's a space here 
		between the walls 'bout three feet 
		across! Smells pretty damn bad! 

				NORTON (O.S.) 
		I don't care what it smells like! 

				HADLEY (O.S.) 
		Go on, boy! We got a hold of you! 

	Looking none too happy about it, Rory squeezes from the tunnel 
	and dangles into the shaft. He gets lowered, shining his 
	light, smothered by darkness. Not having a good time. 

				RORY 
		Hoo-whee! Smell's gettin' worse! 

				NORTON (O.S.) 
		Never mind, I said! Just keep going! 

				RORY 
		Smells pretty damn bad, Warden! In 
		fact, it smells just like shit. 

	His feet touch the ground -- or what he assumed was the 
	ground. It's not. In fact, it's just what it smells like. He 
	sinks in past his ankles. He slips and sits heavily in it. 

				RORY 
		Oh God, that's what it is, it's 
		shit. oh my God it's shit. pull me 
		out 'fore I blow my groceries, oh 
		shit it's shit, oh my Gawwwwwwd! 

225	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- DAY (1966) 225

	Red and others listen to violent barfing from below. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		And then came the unmistakable 
		sound of Rory Tremont losing his 
		last few meals. The whole cellblock 
		heard it. I mean, it echoed. 

	That's it for Red. He starts laughing. Laughing, hell, he's 
	bellowing laughter, laughing so hard he has to hold himself, 
	laughing so hard tears are pouring down his cheeks. The look 
	of rage on Norton's face makes him laugh all the harder. 

226	INT -- SOLITARY WING -- NIGHT (1966) 226

	Abrupt silence. LOW ANGLE on steel door. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		I laughed myself right into 
		solitary. Two week stretch. 

227	INT -- SOLITARY -- NIGHT (1966) 227

				RED 
		It's shit, it's shit, oh my God 
		it's shit... 

	He starts laughing all over again, fit to split. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Andy once talked about doing easy 
		time in the hole. Now I knew what 
		he meant. 

228	EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- WIDE SHOT -- DAY (1966) 228

	Virgin landscape. Charming rural road. Suddenly, State Police
	cruisers rocket up the road with SIRENS AND LIGHTS. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		In 1966, Andy Dufresne escaped from 
		Shawshank Prison. 

229	EXT -- FIELD -- DAY (1966) 229

	Shawshank is half a mile distant. WE TRACK ALONG a muddy creel
	as STATE TROOPERS and PRISON GUARDS scour the brush. A TROOPEE
	fishes a prison uniform out of the creek with a long stick. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		All they found of him was a muddy 
		set of prison clothes, a bar of 
		soap, and an old rock-hammer damn 
		near worn down to the nub. 

	TROOPER g2 pulls the rock-hammer from the weeds. SWISH PAN 
	to a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER. His FLASHBULB GLARE produces: 

230 	A BLACK AND WHITE STILL PHOTO 230

	of the hapless cops posing with Andy's reeking uniform and the
	worn rock-hammer. PUSH IN on the hammer. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		I remember thinking it would take a 
		man six hundred years to tunnel 
		through the wall with it. Andy did 
		it in less than twenty. 

231	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 231

	Once again, we see Andy using the rock-hammer to scratch his

	name into the cement. Suddenly, a palm-sized chunk of cement 
	pops free and hits the floor. He stares down at it. 

232	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 232

	Andy lies in the dark, studying the chunk of concrete in his 
	hands. Considering the possibilities. Wrestling with hope. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Andy loved geology. I imagine it 
		appealed to his meticulous nature. 
		An ice age here, a million years of 
		mountain-building there, plates of 
		bedrock grinding against each other 
		over a span of millennia... 

233	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 233

	Andy stands peering at the small hole left by the fallen 
	chunk. Carefully runs his fingertip over it. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Geology is the study of pressure 
		and time. That's all it takes, 
		really. Pressure and time. 

234	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1951) 234

	Rita is now on the wall, hanging down over Andy's back. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		That and a big damn poster. 

	TRACK IN to reveal Andy scraping patiently at the concrete. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Like I said. In prison, a man'll do 
		most anything to keep his mind 
		occupied. 

	He hears FOOTSTEPS approaching. He smoothes the poster down and 
	dives into bed. A GUARD strolls by a moment later, shining his 
	flashlight into the cell. 

235	EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1953) 235

	Andy strolls along, whistling softly, hands in both pockets. 
	TILT DOWN to his pantleg. Concrete grit trickles out. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		It turns out Andy's favorite hobby 
		was totin' his wall out into the 
		exercise yard a handful at a time... 

236	INT -- 2ND TIER -- NIGHT (1962) 236

	A GUARD strolls the tier, shining his flashlight into the 
	cells. He pauses at Andy's bars, playing the beam over the 
	sleeping form huddled under the blankets. 

	p37 REVERSE ANGLE (FROM INS1DE ANDY'S CELL) 237

	We see what the guard doesn't: instead of Andy's head under 
	the blanket, it's a wadded-up pillow. The flashlight plays 
	across the cell, pinning Marilyn Monroe in a circle of light. 

238 	ANGLE FROM BEHIND POSTER 238

	The light illuminates her face through the paper. WIDEN to 
	reveal Andy lying in his tunnel, holding his breath. The 
	light clicks off. The FOOTSTEPS move on. He gets back to work. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		While the rest of us slept, Andy 
		spent years workin' the nightshift... 

239	INT -- SHAFT -- NIGHT (1965) 239

	BOOMING SLOWLY UP the shaft. Rats scurry the pipes. Suddenly, r
	piece of concrete the size of a quarter jumps free and plummets
	down the shaft as the rock-hammer pushes through. The pick 
	withdraws, replaced by Andy's peering eye. 

240 	A SERIES OF DISSOLVES (1965 through 1966) 240

	takes us through the widening of the hole. First as big as a 
	tea cup. Then a saucer. Then a dinner plate. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Probably took him most of a year 
		just to get his head through. 

	Andy finally gets his head through, scraping his ears. He's 
	got a penlight clenched in his teeth. He peers down into the 
	shaft. At the very bottom, maybe 20 feet down, a big ceramic 
	pipe runs the length of the cellblock. Beneath its coat of 
	grime and dust, the word "SEWER" is stenciled. 

241	EXT -- LOADING DOCK ACCESS -- NIGHT (1966) 241

	ANGLE LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN. Below us, Tommy Williams lies 
	facedown at Norton's feet. Blood is spreading, fanning out oa 
	the pavement. Norton turns, strolls out of frame. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		I guess after Tommy was killed, 
		Andy decided he'd been here just 
		about long enough. 

	Again we see: Andy working. Norton pokes his head in. 

				NORTON 
		Lickety-split. I wanna get home. 

				ANDY 
		Just about done, sir. 

	Norton crosses to the wall safe and works the dial, his back 
	turned. This time, though, we stay on Andy: 

	He pulls up his sweater, yanks out a large black book and a 
	stack of files, lays them on the desk. He then grabs the real 
	ledger and files, jams them down his pants and smoothes his 
	sweater down. He picks up the bogus stack, crosses to Norton, 
	and shoves everything in. 

243	INT -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT (1966) 243

	Norton exits his office and strolls off whistling. PUSH IN on 
	the open door. We see Andy at the guard's desk, pulling 
	Norton's dress shoes from their box. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Andy did like he was told. Buffed 
		those shoes to a high mirror shine. 

244	INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- MINUTES LATER (1966) 244

	Andy sorts through Norton's three suits. He pauses, checking 
	the gray pinstripe. Nice. 

245	INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1966) 245

	The guard BUZZES Andy through. Andy walks toward us. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		The guard simply didn't notice. 
		Neither did I. I mean, seriously, 
		how often do you really look at a 
		man's shoes? 

	TILT DOWN as he passes by. Yep, he's wearing Norton's shoes. 

246	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 246

	The lights go out. Andy places the last chess piece. Gazes up 
	at Racquel. Smiles. Pulls the rope from under his pillow. 
	He stands and unbuttons his prison shirt, revealing Norton's 
	gray pinstripe suit underneath. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING floods the 
	cell, throwing wild shadows. 

247	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 247

	The storm rages. Andy, naked, carefully slips Norton's folded 
	suit into a large industrial Zip-Lock bag. Next to go in are the
	shoes, chess pieces (already in a smaller bag), black ledger en
	files. Last but not least, a bar of soap wrapped in a towel. 

248	INT -- TUNNEL -- NIGHT (1966) 248

	Andy, again wearing prison clothes, inches down the tunnel. 

249	INT -- SHAFT -- NIGHT (1966) 249

	Andy squeezes through the hole head-first, emerges to the waist,
	He reaches for the opposite wall, manages to snag a steel 
	conduit with his fingers. 

	Suddenly, a huge rat darts for his hand. Andy yanks away and 
	almost plummets head-first down the shaft. He dangles wildly 
	upside-down for a moment, arms windmilling, then gets his 
	hands pressed firmly against the opposite wall. The rat 
	scurries off, pissed. 

	Andy snags the conduit again. He contorts out of the hole and
	dangles into the shaft. We now see the purpose for the rope: the
	plastic bag hangs from his ankle with about two feet of slack,

	He kicks his legs across the shaft, gets his feet braced. Wit3
	his back against one wall and feet against the other, he 
	starts down the shaft. Sliding dangerously. Using pipes for 
	handholds. Flinching as rats dart this way and that, scurrying
	in the shadows. He drops the last few feet to the bottom. 

	He approaches the ceramic sewer pipe and kneels before it. 
	Pulls out the rock-hammer and says a quick silent prayer. 
	Raises the rock-hammer high and swings it down with all his 
	might. Once, twice -- third time lucky. An enormous eruption 
	of sewage cascades into the air as if rocket-propelled, the 
	Mount St. Helens of shit. Andy is instantly coated black. He 
	turns away and heaves his guts out. The shit keeps coming. 

250	INT -- SEWER PIPE -- NIGHT (1966) 250

	Andy peers down through the hole, playing his penlight aroun5,
	The inside diameter is no more than two feet. Tight squeeze. 
	Coated with crud. It seems to go on for miles. 

	No turning back. He wriggles into the pipe and starts 
	crawling, plastic bag dragging behind. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Andy crawled to freedom through 
		five hundred yards of shit-smelling 
		foulness I can't even imagine. Or 
		maybe I just don't want to. 

251	EXT -- FIELD -- NIGHT (1966) 251

	Rain is falling in solid sheets. Shawshank is half a mile 
	distant. BOOM DOWN to reveal the creek...and PUSH IN toward the 
	mouth of the sewer pipe that feeds into it. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Five hundred yards. The length of 
		five football fields. Just shy of 
		half a mile. 

	Fingers appear, thrusting through the heavy-gauge wire mesh 
	covering the mouth of the pipe. Andy's face looms from the 
	darkness, peering out at freedom. He wrenches the mesh loose, 
	pushes himself out, and plunges head-first into the creek. He 
	comes up sputtering for breath. The water is waist-deep. 

	He wades upstream, ripping his clothes from his body. He gets 
	his shirt off, spins it through the air over his head, flings 
	the shirt away. He raises his arms to the sky, turning slowly, 
	feeling the rain washing him clean. Exultant. Triumphant. A 
	FLASH OF LIGHTNING arcs from horizon to horizon. 

252	INT -- ANDY'S TUNNEL -- DAY (1966) 252

	Once again, we see stunned faces as CAMERA PULLS BACK. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		The next morning, right about the 
		time Racquel was spilling her 
		little secret... 

253	INT -- CASCO BANK OF PORTLAND -- MORNING (1966) 253

	The door opens. Spit-shined shoes enter. DOLLY the shoes to 
	the counter. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		...a man nobody ever laid eyes on 
		before strolled into the Casco Bank 
		of Portland. Until that moment, he 
		didn't exist -- except on paper. 

				FEMALE TELLER (O.S.) 
		May I help you? 

	TILT UP to Andy. Smiling in Norton's gray pinstripe suit.

				ANDY 
		My name is Peter Stevens. I've come 
		to close out some accounts. 

254	INT -- BANK -- SHORTLY LATER (1966) 254

	The teller is cutting a cashier's check while the MANAGER 

	carefully examines Mr. Stevens' various I.D.s. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		He had all the proper I.D. Driver's 
		license, birth certificate, social 
		security card. The signature was a 
		spot-on match. 

				MANAGER 

	I must say I'm sorry to be losing 
	your business. I hope you'll enjoy 
	living abroad. 

				ANDY 
		Thank you. I'm sure I will. 

				TELLER 
		Here's your cashier's check, sir. 
		Will there be anything else? 

				ANDY 
		Please. Would you add this to your 
		outgoing mail? 

	He hands her a package, stamped and addressed. Gives them a 
	pleasant smile. Turns and strolls from the bank. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen 
		banks in the Portland area that 
		morning. All told, he blew town 
		with better than 370 thousand 
		dollars of Warden Norton's money. 
		Severance pay for nineteen years. 

255	INT -- OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 255

	A MAN in shirtsleeves is going through the mail on his desk. 
	He finds Andy's package, rips it open. Pulls out the black 
	ledger and files. Scans a cover letter. Holy shit. He dashes 
	to his door and yanks it open, revealing the words on the 
	glass: "PORTLAND DAILY BUGLE -- Editor In Chief." 

				MAN 
		Hal! Dave! Get your butts in here! 

256	INT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- DAY (1966) 256

	Norton walks slowly toward his office. Dazed. The morning 
	paper in his hand. He goes wordlessly past the DUTY GUARD into 
	his office. Shuts the door. Lays the paper on his desk. 

	The headline reads: "CORRUPTION AND MURDER AT SHAWSHANK." 
	Below that, the sub-headline: "D.A. Has Ledger. Indictments 
	Expected." Norton looks up as SIRENS SWELL in the distance.

257	EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- WIDE SHOT -- DAY (1966) 257

	For the second time, State Police cruisers go rocketing up the
	road with SIRENS AND LIGHTS. 

258	INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 258

	Norton opens his safe and pulls out the "ledger" -- it's 
	Andy's Bible. The title page is inscribed by hand: "Dear 
	Warden. You were right. Salvation lay within." Norton flips to
	the center of the book -- and finds the pages hollowed out in
	the shape of a rock-hammer. 

259	EXT -- PRISON -- DAY (1966) 259

	Police cruisers everywhere. A media circus. REPORTERS jostle
	for position. A colorless DISTRICT ATTORNEY steps forward into
	CLOSEUP, flanked by a contingent of S.ATE TROOPERS. 

				D.A. 
		Byron Hadley? 

	ANGLE SHIFTS to reveal Captain Hadley. Staring. Waiting. 

				D.A. 
		You have the right to remain 
		silent. If you give up that 
		right, anything you say will be 
		used against you in court... 

	TROOPERS move in, cuffing Hadley's hands behind his back. The
	D.A. drones on. FLASHBULBS POP. Hadley says nothing. His face
	scrunches up. He begins to cry. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		I wasn't there to see it, but I hear 
		Byron Hadley was sobbing like a 
		little girl when they took him away. 

	Hadley sobs all the way to the car. The D.A. snaps a gaze up
	toward Norton's window, motions his men to follow. 

260	INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 260

	Norton is staring out the window as they approach the 
	building. He goes to his desk, opens a drawer. Inside lies a
	revolver and a box of shells. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Norton had no intention of goin' 
		that quietly. 

261	INT -- PRISON CORRIDORS -- DAY (1966) 261

	The D.A. marches along amidst a phalanx of TROOPERS. 

262	INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 262

	Norton sits blankly at his desk, revolver before him. The 
	doorknob rattles, a VOICE is heard: 

				D.A. (O.S.) 
		Samuel Norton? We have a warrant 
		for your arrest! Open up! 

	The POUNDING starts. Norton dumps the box of bullets out on thr
	desk. He starts sorting them to see which ones he likes. 

263 	OUTSIDE HIS OFFICE 263

	Troopers hustle the hapless duty guard to Norton's door as he
	fumbles nervously with a huge key ring. 

				DUTY GUARD 
		I'm not sure which one it is... 

	He starts trying keys in the lock. And as the keys go sliding
	in one after another... 

264	INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 264

	...so do the bullets. Norton is riveted to the door. For every
	key, he loads another bullet. Methodical and grim. He gets the
	final bullet in just as the right key slams home. The door 
	bursts open. Men muscle in. Somebody SHOUTS. Troopers dive in
	all directions as Norton raises the gun -- 

	-- and jams it under his chin. his head snaps back as the wall
	goes red. His swivel chair does a slow half-turn and creaks to
	a final stop. Troopers rise slowly, gazing in horror. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		I like to think the last thing that 
		went through his head...other than 
		that bullet...was to wonder how the 
		hell Andy Dufresne ever got the 
		best of him. 

	PUSH SLOWLY to the wall to reveal Mrs. Norton's framed sampler
	trickling blood and brains...and we get our final Bible lesson
	for today: "HIS JUDGMENT COMETH AND THAT RIGHT SOON." 

265	EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1966) 265

	Mail call. Red hears his name. They pass him a postcard. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Not long after the warden deprived 
		us of his company, I got a postcard 
		in the mail. It was blank. But the 
		postmark said, "McNary, Texas." 

266	INT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1966) 266

	Red sits with an atlas, tracing his finger down the page. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		McNary. Right on the border. That's 
		where Andy crossed. 
			(shuts the book) 
		When I picture him heading south in 
		his own car with the top down, it 
		makes me laugh all over again... 

267	EXT -- MEXICO -- HIGHWAY -- DAY (1966) 267

	A red convertible rips along with Andy at the wheel, cigar 
	jutting from his grin, warm wind fluttering his tie. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Andy Dufresne, who crawled through 
		a river of shit and came out clean 
		on the other side. Andy Dufresne, 
		headed for the Pacific. 

268	INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1966) 268

	Heywood is regaling the table with some anecdote about Andy. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Those of us who knew him best talk 
		about him often. I swear, the stuff 
		he pulled. It always makes us laugh. 

	A wild burst of laughter. PUSH IN on Red. Feeling melancholy.

				RED (V.O.) 
		Sometimes it makes me sad, though, 
		Andy being gone. I have to remind 
		myself that some birds aren't meant 
		to be caged, that's all. Their 
		feathers are just too bright... 

269	EXT -- FIELDS -- LATE DAY (1966) 269

	Convicts hoe the fields. Guards patrol on horseback. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		...and when they fly away, the part 
		of you that knows it was a sin to 
		lock them up does rejoice...but still, 
		the place you live is that much more 
		drab and empty that they're gone. 

	A DISTANT RUMBLE OF THUNDER. Red pauses, gazes off. Storm 
	clouds coming in, backlit by the sun. A light drizzle begins. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		I guess I just miss my friend. 

270	INT -- PRISON CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 270

	Red is sleeping. He wakes with a start. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		But there are times I curse him for 
		the dreams he left behind... 

	He senses a presence, looks over his shoulder. There's a Rita 
	Hayworth poster on his wall. He gets out of bed. Rita just 

	keeps smiling, inscrutable. As Red watches, a brilliant 
	round glow builds behind the poster, shining from the 
	tunnel. The poster rips free, charred to ash in the blink 
	of an eye as a shaft of holy white light stabs into the 
	cell. Sunlight. Red staggers back against the glare. 

	A whirlwind kicks up, whipping everything into the air. The 
	hole in the wall is like a giant vacuum cleaner -- papers, 
	book, toiletries, bedding -- if it ain't nailed down, it gets 
	sucked down the hole toward the light. Red fights it, but the 
	suction drags him closer and closer... 

271 	RED'S POV 271

	...and CAMERA rockets into the hole, getting sucked down an 
	endless tunnel at impossible speed, the ROAR of air mixing 
	with his drawn-out SCREAM, closer and closer to the light... 

	...and erupting out the other side into total silence and a 
	beautiful white beach. The Pacific Ocean before us. Enormous. 
	Mind-blowing. Beautiful beyond description. All we hear now 
	are the gentle sound of waves. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		...dreams where I am lost in a warm 
		place with no memory. 

	A lone figure stands at water's edge. CAMERA KEEPS MOVING, 
	coming up behind him and TRACKING AROUND to reveal -- Red. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		An ocean so big it strikes me dumb. 
		Waves so quiet they strike me deaf. 
		Sunshine so bright it strikes me 
		blind. It is a place that is blue 
		beyond reason. Bluer than can 
		possibly exist. Bluer than my mind 
		can possibly grasp. 

272 	AERIAL SHOT 272

	Nothing for a million miles but beach, sky, and water. Red is 
	a tiny speck at water's edge. Just another grain of sand. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		I am terrified. There is no way home. 

273	INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 273

	Red wakes from the nightmare. He gets out of bed. Moves to the 
	barred window of his cell. Peers up at the stars. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Andy. I know you're in that place. 
		Look at the stars for me just after 
		sunset. Touch the sand...wade in 
		the water...and feel free. 

	FADE TO BLACK 

274 	AN IRON-BARRED DOOR 274

	slides open with an enormous CLANG. A stark room beyond. 
	CAMERA PUSHES through. SIX MEN AND ONE WOMAN sit at a long 
	table. An empty chair faces them. We are again in: 

	INT -- SHAWSHANK HEARINGS ROOM -- DAY (1967) 

	Red enters, sits. 20 years older than when we first saw him.

				MAN #1 
		Your file says you've served forty 
		years of a life sentence. You feel 
		you've been rehabilitated? 

	Red doesn't answer. Just stares off. Seconds tick by. The 
	parole board exchanges glances. Somebody clears his throat. 

				MAN #1 
		Shall I repeat the question? 

				RED 
		I heard you. Rehabilitated. Let's 
		see now. You know, come to think of 
		it, I have no idea what that means. 

				MAN #2 
		Well, it means you're ready to 
		rejoin society as a-- 

				RED 
		I know what you think it means. Me, 
		I think it's a made-up word, a poli- 
		tician's word. A word so young fellas 
		like you can wear a suit and tie and 
		have a job. What do you really want 
		to know? Am I sorry for what I did? 

	- ----- 

				MAN g2 
		Well...are you? 

				RED 
		Not a day goes by I don't feel 
		regret, and not because I'm in here 
		or because you think I should. I 
		look back on myself the way I 
		was...stupid kid who did that 
		terrible crime...wish I could talk 
		sense to him. Tell him how things 
		are. But I can't. That kid's long 
		gone, this old man is all that's 
		left, and I have to live with that. 
			(beat) 
		Rehabilitated? That's a bullshit 
		word, so you just go on ahead and 
		stamp that form there, sonny, and 
		stop wasting my damn time. Truth 
		is, I don't give a shit. 

	The parole board just stares. Red sits drumming his fingers. 

	CLOSEUP -- PAROLE FORM 

	A big rubber stamp SLAMS down -- and lifts away to reveal the 
	word "APPROVED" in red ink. 

275	EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- DAY 275 

	TWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS herald the opening of the main gate. It 
	swings hugely open, revealing Red standing in his cheap suit, 
	carrying a cheap bag, wearing a cheap hat. He walks out, still 
	looking stunned. 

276	INT -- BUS -- DAY 276 

	Red rides the bus, clutching the seat before him, gripped by 
	terror of speed and motion. 

277	EXT -- BREWSTER HOTEL -- LATE AFTERNOON 277 

	Red arrives at the Brewster, three stories high and even less 
	to look at than it used to be. 

27B	INT -- BREWSTER -- LATE DAY 278 

	A BLACK WOMAN leads Red up the stairs toward the top floor. 

279	INT -- RED'S ROOM -- LATE DAY 279 

	Small, old, dingy. An arched window with a view of Congress
	Street. Traffic noise floats up. Red enters and pauses, 
	staring up at the ceiling beam. Carved into the wood are the
	words: "Brooks Hatlen was here." 

280	INT -- FOODWAY MARKET -- DAY 280

	Loud. Jangling with PEOPLE and NOISE. We find Red bagging 
	groceries. Registers are humming, kids are shrieking. Red 
	calls to the STORE MANAGER: 

				RED 
		Sir? Restroom break sir? 

				MANAGER 
			(motions him over) 
		You don't need to ask me every 
		time you go take a piss. Just go. 
		Understand? 

28l	INT -- EMPLOYEE RESTROOM -- DAY 281

	Red steps to the urinal, stares at himself in the wall mirror. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Thirty years I've been asking 
		permission to piss. I can't squeeze 
		a drop without say-so. 

	A strange east Indian guitar-whine begins. The Beatles. George 
	Harrison's "Within You Without You..." 

282	EXT -- STREET -- DAY 282

	...which carries through as Red walks. People and traffic. He 
	keeps looking at the women. An alien species. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Women, too, that's the other thing. 
		I forgot they were half the human 
		race. There's women everywhere, 
		every shape and size. I find myself 
		semi-hard most of the time, cursing 
		myself for a dirty old man. 

	TWO YOUNG WOMEN stroll by in cut-offs and t-shirts. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Not a brassiere to be seen, nipples 
		poking out at the world. Jeezus, 
		pleeze-us. Back in my day, a woman 
		out in public like that would have 
		been arrested and given a sanity 
		hearing. 

283	EXT -- PARK -- DUSK 283

	Red finds the park filled with HIPPIES. Hanging out. 
	Happening. Here's the source of the music: a radio. A HIPPIE 
	GIRL gyrates to the Beatles, stoned, in her own world. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		They're calling this the Summer of 
		Love. Summer of Loonies, you ask me. 

284	INT -- PAROLE OFFICE -- DAY 284

	Red sits across from his PAROLE OFFICER. The P.O. is filling
	out his report. 

				P.O. 
		You staying out of the bars, Red? 

				RED 
		Yes sir. That I am. 

				P.O. 
		How you doing otherwise? Adjusting 
		okay? 

				RED 
		Things got different out here. 

				P.O. 
		Tell me about it. Young punks 
		protesting the war. You imagine? 
		Even my own kid. Oughtta bust his 
		fuckin' skull. 

				RED 
		Guess the world moved on. 

285	INT -- FOODWAY -- DAY 285

	Bagging groceries. CHILDREN underfoot. One points a toy gun at
	Red, pumping the trigger. Red focuses on the gun, listening to
	it CLICKETY-CLACK. Sparky wheel grinding. 

	The kids get swept off by MOM. Red starts bagging the next 
	customer. SLOW PUSH IN on Red. Surrounded by MOTION and NOISE.
	Feeling like the eye of a hurricane. People everywhere, 
	whipping around him like a gale. Strange. Loud. Dizzying. It
	gets distorted and weird, slow and thick, pressing in on him
	from all sides. The noise level intensifies. The hollering of
	children deepens and distends into LOW EERIE HOWLS. 

	He's in the grip of a major anxiety attack. Tries to shake
	himself out of it. Can't. Fumbles the final items into the
	bag. Walks away. Trying not to panic. Trying not to run. 

	He makes his way through the store. Blinking sweat. He bumps
	into a lady's cart, mumbles an apology, keeps going. Breaks 
	into a trot. Down the aisle, cut to the left, through the door
	into the back rooms, faster and faster, running now, slamming
	through a door marked "Employees Only" into -- 

286	INT -- EMPLOYEE RESTROOM -- DAY 286

	-- where he slams the door and leans heavily against it, 
	shutting everything out, breathing heavily. Alone now. 

	He goes to the sink, splashes his face, tries to calm down. 
	He can still hear them out there. They won't go away. He 
	glances around the restroom. Small. Not small enough. 

	He enters a stall. Locks the door. Puts the toilet lid down 
	and sits on the john. Better. He can actually reach out and 
	touch the walls now. They're close. Safe. Almost small enough. 
	He draws his feet up so he can't be seen if somebody walks in. 

	He'll just sit here for a while. Until he calms down. 

287	EXT -- STREET -- DUSK 287

	Red is walking home. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		There is a harsh truth to face. 
		No way I'm gonna make it on the 
		outside. 

	He pauses at a pawnshop window. An array of handguns. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		All I do anymore is think of ways 
		to break my parole. 

	The SHOPKEEPER appears at the glass, locking the door and 
	flipping the sign: CLOSED. 

288	INT -- RED'S ROOM -- NIGHT 288

	Red lies smoking in bed. Unable to sleep. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Terrible thing, to live in fear. 
		Brooks Hatlen knew it. Knew it all 
		too well. All I want is to be back 
		where things make sense. Where I 
		won't have to be afraid all the time. 

	He glances up at the ceiling beam. "Brooks Hatlen was here." 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Only one thing stops me. A promise 
		I made to Andy. 

289	EXT -- COUNTRY ROAD -- MORNING 289

	A pickup truck rattles up the road trailing dust and pulls to 
	a stop. Red hops off the back, waves his thanks. The truck 

	drives on. Red starts walking. PAN TO a roadside sign: BUXTON. 

290	EXT -- MAINE COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY 290

	High white clouds in a blazing blue sky. The trees fiery with 
	autumn color. Red walks the fields and back-roads, cheap 
	compass in hand. Looking for a certain hayfield. 

291	EXT -- COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY 291

	Walking. Searching. The day turning late. Red finds himself 
	staring at a distant field. There's a long rock wall, like 
	something out o f a Robert Frost poem. Big oak tree. Red checks 
	his compass. North end. He crosses a dirt road into the field. 

292	EXT -- HAYFIELD -- DAY 292

	Red walks the long rock wall, nearing the tree. A squirrel 
	scolds him from a low branch, scurries up higher. Red studies
	the base of the wall. Nothing unusual here. Just a bunch of
	rocks set in stone. He sighs. Fool's errand. Turns to go. 

	Something catches his eye. He walks back, squats, peering 
	closer. Wets a fingertip and rubs a stone. A layer of dust comes 
	off. Volcanic glass. Gleaming black. He tries to get the rock 
	out, anticipation growing. It won't come; it's too smooth. He 
	pulls a pocketknife and levers the rock free. It tumbles at his 
	feet, leaving a ragged hole. 

	Red leans down and solves the mystery at last, staring at the 
	object buried under the rock. Stunned. It's an envelope wrapped 
	in plastic. Written on it is a single word: "Red." 

	Red pulls the envelope out and rises. He just stares at it for 
	a while, almost afraid to open it. But open it he does. Inside 
	is a smaller envelope and a letter. Red begins to read: 

				ANDY (V.O.) 
		Dear Red. If you're reading this, 
		you've gotten out. And if you've 
		come this far, maybe you're willing 
		to come a little further. You 
		remember the name of the town, 
		don't you? I could use a good man 
		to help me get my project on 
		wheels. I'll keep an eye out for 
		you and the chessboard ready. 
			(beat) 
		Remember, Red. Hope is a good 
		thing, maybe the best of things, 
		and no good thing ever dies. I will 
		be hoping that this letter finds 
		you, and finds you well. Your 
		friend. Andy. 

	By now, tears are spilling silently down Red's cheeks. He 
	opens the other envelope and fans out a stack of new fifty- 
	dollar bills. Twenty of them. A thousand dollars. 

293	INT -- RED'S ROOM -- DAY (1967) 293

	Red is dressed in his suit. He finishes knotting his tie, puts 
	his hat on. His bag is by the door. He takes one last look 
	around. Only one thing left to do. He pulls a wooden chair to 
	the center of the room and gazes up at the ceiling beam. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Get busy living or get busy dying. 
		That is goddamn right. 

	He steps up on the chair. It wobbles under his weight. 

294	INT -- BREWSTER -- RED'S DOOR -- DAY (1967) 294

	The door opens. Red exits with his bag and heads down the 
	stairs, leaving the door open. CAMERA PUSHES through, BOOMING 
	UP to the ceiling beam which reads: "Brooks Hatlen was here." 

	A new message has been carved alongside the old: "So was Red." 

295	INT -- GREYHOUND BUS STATION -- DAY (1967) 295

	TRACKING SHOT reveals a long line of people at the counter. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		For the second time in my life, I 
		am guilty of committing a crime. 

	CAMERA brings us to Red, next in line, bag by his feet. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Parole violation. I doubt they'll 
		toss up any roadblocks for that. 
		Not for an old crook like me. 

				RED 
			(steps up) 
		McNary, Texas? 

296	EXT -- TRAVELING SHOT -- DAY (1967) 296

	A gorgeous New England landscape whizzes by, fields and trees 
	a blur of motion. ANGLE SHIFTS to reveal a Greyhound Sceni- 
	Cruiser barreling up the road, pulling abreast of us. CAMERA 
	TRAVELS from window to window, passing faces. We finally come 
	to Red gazing out at the passing landscape. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		I find I am so excited I can barely 
		sit still or hold a thought in my 
		head. I think it is the excitement 
		only a free man can feel, a free 
		man at the start of a long journey 
		whose conclusion is uncertain... 
		297 THE BUS 297

	ROARS past camera, dwindling to a mere speck on the horizon. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		I hope I can make it across the 
		border. I hope to see my friend 
		and shake his hand. I hope the 
		Pacific is as blue as it has been 
		in my dreams. 
			(beat) 
		I hope. 

298	EXT -- BEACH -- WIDE PANORAMIC SHOT -- DAY (1967) 298

	A distant boat lies on its side in the sand like an old wreck 
	that's been left to rot in the sun. There's someone out there. 

299 	CLOSER ON BOAT 299

	A MAN is meticulously stripping the old paint and varnish by 
	hand, face hidden with goggles and kerchief mask. 

	Red appears b.g., a distant figure walking out across the 
	sand, wearing his cheap suit and carrying his cheap bag. 

	The man on the boat pauses. Turns slowly around. Red arrives 
	with a smile as wide as the horizon. The other man raises his 
	goggles and pulls down his mask. Andy, of course. 

				ANDY 
		You look like a man who knows how 
		to get things. 

				RED 
		I'm known to locate certain things 
		from time to time. 

	Red shrugs off his jacket and picks up a sander. Together, 
	they start sanding the hull as we 

	FADE OUT 

	THE END

March 29, 1971				New York, New York 10019





	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	The PARAMOUNT Logo is presented austerely over a black
	background.  There is a moment's hesitation, and then the
	simple words in white lettering:

				  THE GODFATHER

	While this remains, we hear: "I believe in America."
	Suddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a
	man of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great
	emotion.

				BONASERA
		America has made my fortune.

	As he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen.

				BONASERA
		I raised my daughter in the American
		fashion; I gave her freedom, but
		taught her never to dishonor her
		family.  She found a boy friend,
		not an Italian.  She went to the
		movies with him, stayed out late.
		Two months ago he took her for a
		drive, with another boy friend.
		They made her drink whiskey and
		then they tried to take advantage
		of her.  She resisted; she kept her
		honor.  So they beat her like an
		animal.  When I went to the hospital
		her nose was broken, her jaw was
		shattered and held together by
		wire, and she could not even weep
		because of the pain.

	He can barely speak; he is weeping now.

				BONASERA
		I went to the Police like a good
		American.  These two boys were
		arrested and brought to trial.  The
		judge sentenced them to three years
		in prison, and suspended the
		sentence.  Suspended sentence!
		They went free that very day.  I
		stood in the courtroom like a fool,
		and those bastards, they smiled at
		me.  Then I said to my wife, for
		Justice, we must go to The Godfather.

	By now, THE VIEW is full, and we see Don Corleone's office
	in his home.

	The blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with
	patterned shadows.  We are watching BONASERA over the
	shoulder of DON CORLEONE.  TOM HAGEN sits near a small
	table, examining some paperwork, and SONNY CORLEONE stands
	impatiently by the window nearest his father, sipping from a
	glass of wine.  We can HEAR music, and the laughter and
	voices of many people outside.

				DON CORLEONE
		Bonasera, we know each other for
		years, but this is the first time
		you come to me for help.  I don't
		remember the last time you invited
		me to your house for coffee...even
		though our wives are friends.

				BONASERA
		What do you want of me?  I'll give
		you anything you want, but do what
		I ask!

				DON CORLEONE
		And what is that Bonasera?

	BONASERA whispers into the DON's ear.

				DON CORLEONE
		No.  You ask for too much.

				BONASERA
		I ask for Justice.

				DON CORLEONE
		The Court gave you justice.

				BONASERA
		An eye for an eye!

				DON CORLEONE
		But your daughter is still alive.

				BONASERA
		Then make them suffer as she
		suffers.  How much shall I pay you.

	Both HAGEN and SONNY react.

				DON CORLEONE
		You never think to protect yourself
		with real friends.  You think it's
		enough to be an American.  All
		right, the Police protects you,
		there are Courts of Law, so you
		don't need a friend like me.
		But now you come to me and say Don
		Corleone, you must give me justice.
		And you don't ask in respect or
		friendship.  And you don't think to
		call me Godfather; instead you come
		to my house on the day my daughter
		is to be married and you ask me to
		do murder...for money.

				BONASERA
		America has been good to me...

				DON CORLEONE
		Then take the justice from the
		judge, the bitter with the sweet,
		Bonasera.  But if you come to me
		with your friendship, your loyalty,
		then your enemies become my enemies,
		and then, believe me, they would
		fear you...

	Slowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs.

				BONASERA
		Be my friend.

				DON CORLEONE
		Good.  From me you'll get Justice.

				BONASERA
		Godfather.

				DON CORLEONE
		Some day, and that day may never
		come, I would like to call upon you
		to do me a service in return.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	A HIGH ANGLE of the CORLEONE MALL in bright daylight.  There
	are at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard
	and gardens.  There is music and laughing and dancing and
	countless tables covered with food and wine.

	DON CORLEONE stands at the Gate, flanked on either side by a
	son: FREDO and SONNY, all dressed in the formal attire of
	the wedding party.  He warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the
	hands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the
	children, and makes them all welcome.  They in turn carry
	with them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked
	bread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies.

	The entire family poses for a family portrait: DON CORLEONE,
	MAMA, SONNY, his wife, SANDRA, and their children, TOM HAGEN
	and his wife, THERESA, and their BABY; CONSTANZIA, the
	bride, and her bridegroom, CARLO RIZZI.  As they move into
	the pose, THE DON seems preoccupied.

				DON CORLEONE
		Where's Michael?

				SONNY
		He'll be here Pop, it's still early.

				DON CORLEONE
		Then the picture will wait for him.

	Everyone in the group feels the uneasiness as the DON moves
	back to the house.  SONNY gives a delicious smile in the
	direction of the Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI.  She returns
	it.  Then he moves to his wife.

				SONNY
		Sandra, watch the kids.  They're
		running wild.

				SANDRA
		You watch yourself.

	HAGEN kisses his WIFE, and follows THE DON, passing the wine
	barrels, where a group of FOUR MEN nervously wait.  TOM
	crooks a finger at NAZORINE, who doublechecks that he is
	next, straightens, and follows HAGEN.

	EXT DAY: MALL ENTRANCE (SUMMER 1945)

	Outside the main gate of the Mall, SEVERAL MEN in suits,
	working together with a MAN in a dark sedan, walk in and out
	of the rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers
	down in their notebooks.  We HEAR the music and laughter
	coming from the party in the distance.

	A MAN stops at a limousine and copies down the number.

	BARZINI, dignified in a black homburg, is always under the
	watchful eyes of TWO BODYGUARDS as he makes his way to
	embrace DON CORLEONE in the courtyard.

	The MEN walk down another row of parked cars.  Put another
	number in the notebook.  A shiney new Cadillac with wooden
	bumpers.

	PETER CLEMENZA, dancing the Tarantella joyously, bumping
	bellies with the ladies.

				CLEMENZA
		Paulie...wine...WINE.

	He mops his sweating forehead with a big handkerchief.
	PAULIE hustles, gets a glass of icy black wine, and brings
	it to him.

				PAULIE
		You look terrif on the floor!

				CLEMENZA
		What are you, a dance judge?  Go do
		your job; take a walk around the
		neighborhood... see everything is
		okay.

	PAULIE nods and leaves; CLEMENZA takes a breath, and leaps
	back into the dance.

	The MEN walk down another row of parked cars.  Put another
	number in the notebook.

	TESSIO, a tall, gentle-looking man, dances with a NINE-YEAR-
	OLD GIRL, her little black party shoes planted on his
	enormous brown shoes.

	The MEN move on to other parked cars, when SONNY storms out
	of the gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by
	CLEMENZA and PAULIE.

				SONNY
		Buddy, this is a private party.

	The MAN doesn't answer, but points to the DRIVER of the
	sedan.  SONNY menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him.
	The DRIVER merely flips open his wallet to a greed card,
	without saying a word.  SONNY steps back, spits on the
	ground, turns, and walks away, followed by CLEMENZA, PAULIE,
	and another TWO MEN.  He doesn't say a thing for most of the
	walk back into the courtyard, and then, muttered to PAULIE.

				SONNY
		Goddamn FBI...don't respect nothing.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE sits quietly behind his massive desk in the
	dark study.

				NAZORINE
		...a fine boy from Sicily, captured
		by the American Army, and sent to
		New Jersey as a prisoner of war...

				DON CORLEONE
		Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I
		can do.

				NAZORINE
		Now that the war is over, Enzo,
		this boy is being repatriated to
		Italy.  And you see, Godfather...
			  (he wrings his hands,
			  unable to express himself)
		He...my daughter...they...

				DON CORLEONE
		You want him to stay in this country.

				NAZORINE
		Godfather, you understand everything.

				DON CORLEONE
		Tom, what we need is an Act of
		Congress to allow Enzo to become a
		citizen.

				NAZORINE
			  (impressed)
		An Act of Congress!

				HAGEN
			  (nodding)
		It will cost.

	The DON shrugs; such are the way with those things; NAZORINE
	nods.

				NAZORINE
		Is that all?  Godfather, thank
		you...
			  (backing out, enthusiastically)
		Oh, wait till you see the cake I
		made for your beautiful daughter!

	NAZORINE backs out, all smiles, and nods to the GODFATHER.
	DON CORLEONE rises and moves to the Venetian blinds.

				HAGEN
		Who do I give this job to?

	The DON moves to the windows, peeking out through the blinds.

				DON CORLEONE
		Not to one of our paisans...give it
		to a Jew Congressman in another
		district.  Who else is on the list
		for today?

	The DON is peeking out to the MEN around the barrel, waiting
	to see him.

				HAGEN
		Francesco Nippi.  His nephew has
		been refused parole.  A bad case.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	WHAT HE SEES:

	NIPPI waits nervously by the barrel.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		His father worked with you in the
		freight yards when you were young.

	LUCA BRASI sitting alone, grotesque and quiet.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		He's not on the list, but Luca
		Brasi wants to see you.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	The DON turns to HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		Is it necessary?

				HAGEN
		You understand him better than
		anyone.

	The DON nods to this.  Turns back to the blinds and peeks out.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	WHAT HE SEES:

	MICHAEL CORLEONE, dressed in the uniform of a Marine Captain,
	leads KAY ADAMS through the wedding crowd, occasionally
	stopped and greeted by FRIENDS of the family.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	The DON, inside the office, peering through the blinds,
	following them.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	MICHAEL moves through the crowd, embraces MAMA and introduces
	her to his GIRL.

	EXT DAY: OFFICE WINDOW (SUMMER 1945)

	The DON's eyes peering through the blinds.

	EXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)

	KAY and MICHAEL settle by a table on the edge of the wedding,
	burdened down with plates of food and glasses and wine.  She
	is exhilarated by the enormity of the affair, the music and
	the vitality.

				KAY
		I've never seen anything like it.

				MICHAEL
		I told you I had a lot of relatives.

	KAY looking about, a young and lively thing in a gift shop.
	We see what she sees:

	Her interest is caught by THREE MEN standing by the wine
	barrels.

				KAY
			  (amused)
		Michael, what are those men doing?

				MICHAEL
		They're waiting to see my father.

				KAY
		They're talking to themselves.

				MICHAEL
		They're going to talk to my father,
		which means they're going to ask
		him for something, which means they
		better get it right.

				KAY
		Why do they bother him on a day
		like this?

				MICHAEL
		Because they know that no Sicilian
		will refuse a request on his
		daughter's wedding day.

	EXT DAY: WEDDING PARTY (SUMMER 1945)

	CONNIE CORLEONE, the Bride, is pressing the bodice of her
	overly-fluffy white gown against the groom, CARLO RIZZI.  He
	is bronzed, with curly blondish hair and lovely dimples.
	She absolutely adores him and can barely take her eyes from
	him long enough to thank the various GUESTS for the white
	envelopes they are putting into the large white purse she
	holds.  In fact, if we watch carefully, we can see that one
	of her hands is slid under his jacket, and into his shirt,
	where she is provocatively rubbing the hair on his chest.
	CARLO, on the other hand, has his blue eyes trained on the
	bulging envelopes, and is trying to guess how much cash the
	things hold.

	Discreetly, he moves her hand off of his skin.

				CARLO
			  (whispered)
		Cut it out, Connie.

	The purse, looped by a ribbon of silk around CONNIE's arm,
	is fat with money.

				PAULIE (O.S.)
		What do you think?  Twenty grand?

	A little distance away, a young man, PAULIE GATTO, catches a
	prosciutto sandwich thrown by a friend, without once taking
	eyes from the purse.

				PAULIE
		Who knows?  Maybe more.  Twenty,
		thirty grand in small bills cash in
		that silk purse.  Holy Toledo, if
		this was somebody else's wedding!

	SONNY is sitting at the Wedding Dias, talking to LUCY
	MANCINI, the Maid of Honor.  Every once in a while he
	glances across the courtyard, where his WIFE is talking with
	some WOMEN.

	He bends over and whispers something into LUCY's ear.

	SANDRA and the WOMEN are in the middle of a big, ribald laugh.

				WOMAN
		Is it true what they say about your
		husband, Sandra?

	SANDRA's hands separate with expanding width further and
	further apart until she bursts into a peal of laughter.
	Through her separated hands she sees the Wedding Dais.
	SONNY and LUCY are gone.

	INT DAY: DON'S HALL & STAIRS (SUMMER 1945)

	The empty hallway.  The bathroom door opens and LUCY
	surreptitiously steps out.

	She looks up where SONNY is standing on the second landing,
	motioning for her to come up.

	She lifts her petticoats off the ground and hurries upstairs.

	EXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)

	KAY and MICHAEL.

				KAY
			  (in a spooky low tone)
		Michael, that scarey guy...Is he a
		relative?

	She has picked out LUCA BRASI.

				MICHAEL
		No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You
		wouldn't like him.

				KAY
			  (Excited)
		Who is he?

				MICHAEL
			  (Sizing her up)
		You really want to know?

				KAY
		Yes.  Tell me.

				MICHAEL
		You like spaghetti?

				KAY
		You know I love spaghetti.

				MICHAEL
		Then eat your spaghetti and I'll
		tell you a Luca Brasi story.

	She starts to eat her spaghetti.

	She begins eating, looking at him eagerly.

				MICHAEL
		Once upon a time, about fifteen
		years ago some people wanted to
		take over my father's olive oil
		business.  They had Al Capone send
		some men in from Chicago to kill my
		father, and they almost did.

				KAY
		Al Capone!

				MICHAEL
		My Father sent Luca Brasi after
		them.  He tied the two Capone men
		hand and foot, and stuffed small
		bath towels into their mouths.
		Then he took an ax, and chopped one
		man's feet off...

				KAY
		Michael...

				MICHAEL
		Then the legs at the knees...

				KAY
		Michael you're trying to scare me...

				MICHAEL
		Then the thighs where they joined
		the torso.

				KAY
		Michael, I don't want to hear
		anymore...

				MICHAEL
		Then Luca turned to the other man...

				KAY
		Michael, I love you.

				MICHAEL
		...who out of sheer terror had
		swallowed the bath towel in his
		mouth and suffocated.

	The smile on his face seems to indicate that he is telling a
	tall story.

				KAY
		I never know when you're telling me
		the truth.

				MICHAEL
		I told you you wouldn't like him.

				KAY
		He's coming over here!

	LUCA comes toward them to meet TOM HAGEN halfway, just near
	their table.

				MICHAEL
		Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay
		Adams.

				KAY
			  (having survived LUCA)
		How do you do.

				MICHAEL
		My brother, Tom Hagen.

				HAGEN
		Hello Kay.  Your father's inside,
		doing some business.
			  (privately)
		He's been asking for you.

				MICHAEL
		Thanks Tom.

	HAGEN smiles and moves back to the house, LUCA ominously
	following.

				KAY
		If he's your brother, why does he
		have a different name?

				MICHAEL
		My brother Sonny found him living
		in the streets when he was a kid,
		so my father took him in.  He's a
		good lawyer.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE at the window.  He has seen the intimacy of the
	YOUNG COUPLE.

				LUCA (O.S.)
		Don Corleone...

	THE DON turns to the stiffly formal LUCA, and he moves
	forward to kiss his hand.  He takes the envelope from his
	jacket, holds it out, but does not release it until he makes
	a formal speech.

				LUCA
			  (with difficulty)
		Don Corleone...I am honored, and
		grateful...that you invited me to
		your home...on the wedding day of
		your...daughter.
		May their first child...be a
		masculine child.  I pledge my never
		ending loyalty.
			  (he offers the envelope)
		For your daughter's bridal purse.

				DON CORLEONE
		Thank you, Luca, my most valued
		friend.

	THE DON takes it, and then LUCA's hand, which he squeezes so
	tightly we might imagine it to be painful.

				LUCA
		Let me leave you, Don Corleone.  I
		know you are busy.

	He turns, almost an about-face, and leaves the study with
	the same formality he entered with.  DON CORLEONE breathes
	more easily, and gives the thick envelope to HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		I'm sure it's the most generous
		gift today.

				HAGEN
		The Senator called--apologized for
		not coming personally, but said
		you'd understand.  Also, some of
		the Judges...they've all sent gifts.
		And another call from Virgil
		Sollozzo.

	DON CORLEONE is not pleased.

				HAGEN
		The action is narcotics.  Sollozzo
		has contacts in Turkey for the
		poppy, in Sicily for the plants to
		process down to morphine or up to
		heroin.  Also he has access to this
		country.  He's coming to us for
		financial help, and some sort of
		immunity from the law.  For that we
		get a piece of the action, I
		couldn't find out how much.
		Sollozzo is vouched for by the
		Tattaglia family, and they may have
		a piece of the action.  They call
		Sollozzo the Turk.
		He's spent a lot of time in Turkey
		and is suppose to have a Turkish
		wife and kids.  He's suppose to be
		very quick with the knife, or was,
		when he was younger.  Only in
		matters of business and with some
		reasonable complaint.  Also he has
		an American wife and three children
		and he is a good family man.

	THE DON nods.

				HAGEN
		He's his own boss, and very
		competent.

				DON CORLEONE
		And with prison record.

				HAGEN
		Two terms; one in Italy, one in the
		United States.  He's known to the
		Government as a top narcotics man.
		That could be a plus for us; he
		could never get immunity to testify.

				DON CORLEONE
		When did he call?

				HAGEN
		This morning.

				DON CORLEONE
		On a day like this.  Consiglero, do
		you also have in your notes the the
		Turk made his living from
		Prostitution before the war, like
		the Tattaglias do now.  Write that
		down before you forget it.  The
		Turk will wait.

	We now begin to hear a song coming over the loud-speakers
	from outside.  In Italian, with unmistakable style.

				DON CORLEONE
		What that?  It sounds like Johnny.

	He moves to the window, pulls the blinds up, flooding the
	room with light.

				DON CORLEONE
		It is Johnny.  He came all the way
		from California to be at the wedding.

				HAGEN
		Should I bring him in.

				DON CORLEONE
		No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You
		see?  He is a good godson.

				HAGEN
		It's been two years.  He's probably
		in trouble again.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	JOHNNY FONTANE on the bandstand, singing to the delight and
	excitement of the wedding GUESTS.

				KAY
		I didn't know your family knew
		Johnny Fontane.

				MICHAEL
		Sure.

				KAY
		I used to come down to New York
		whenever he sang at the Capitol and
		scream my head off.

				MICHAEL
		He's my father's godson; he owes
		him his whole career.

	JOHNNY finishes the song and the CROWD screams with delight.
	They call out for another when DON CORLEONE appears.

				DON CORLEONE
		My Godson has come three thousand
		miles to do us honor and no one
		thinks to wet his throat.

	At once a dozen wine glasses are offered to JOHNNY, who
	takes a sip from each as he moves to embrace his GODFATHER.

				JOHNNY
		I kept trying to call you after my
		divorce and Tom always said you
		were busy.  When I got the Wedding
		invitation I knew you weren't sore
		at me anymore, Godfather.

				DON CORLEONE
		Can I do something for you still?
		You're not too rich, or too famous
		that I can't help you?

				JOHNNY
		I'm not rich anymore, Godfather,
		and...my career, I'm almost washed
		up...

	He's very disturbed.  The GODFATHER indicates that he come
	with him to the office so no one will notice.  He turns to
	HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		Tell Santino to come in with us.
		He should hear some things.

	They go, leaving HAGEN scanning the party looking for SONNY.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	HAGEN glances up the staircase.

				HAGEN
		Sonny?

	Then he goes up.

	INT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

	SONNY and LUCY are in a room upstairs; he has lifted her
	gown's skirts almost over her head, and has her standing
	against the door.  Her face peeks out from the layers of
	petticoats around it like a flower in ecstasy.

				LUCY
		Sonnyeeeeeeee.

	Her head bouncing against the door with the rhythm of his
	body.  But there is a knocking as well.  They stop, freeze
	in that position.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		Sonny?  Sonny, you in there?

	INT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY (SUMMER 1945)

	Outside, HAGEN by the door.

				HAGEN
		The old man wants you; Johnny's
		here...he's got a problem.

				SONNY (O.S.)
		Okay.  One minute.

	HAGEN hesitates.  We HEAR LUCY's head bouncing against the
	door again.  TOM leaves.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

				DON CORLEONE
		ACT LIKE A MAN!  By Christ in
		Heaven, is it possible you turned
		out no better than a Hollywood
		finocchio.

	Both HAGEN and JOHNNY cannot refrain from laughing.  The DON
	smiles.  SONNY enters as noiselessly as possible, still
	adjusting his clothes.

				DON CORLEONE
		All right, Hollywood...Now tell me
		about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta
		who won't let you work.

				JOHNNY
		He owns the studio.  Just a month
		ago he bought the movie rights to
		this book, a best seller.  And the
		main character is a guy just like
		me.  I wouldn't even have to act,
		just be myself.

	The DON is silent, stern.

				DON CORLEONE
		You take care of your family?

				JOHNNY
		Sure.

	He glances at SONNY, who makes himself as inconspicuous as
	he can.

				DON CORLEONE
		You look terrible.  I want you to
		eat well, to rest.  And spend time
		with your family.  And then, at the
		end of the month, this big shot
		will give you the part you want.

				JOHNNY
		It's too late.  All the contracts
		have been signed, they're almost
		ready to shoot.

				DON CORLEONE
		I'll make him an offer he can't
		refuse.

	He takes JOHNNY to the door, pinching his cheek hard enough
	to hurt.

				DON CORLEONE
		Now go back to the party and leave
		it to me.

	He closes the door, smiling to himself.  Turns to HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		When does my daughter leave with
		her bridegroom?

				HAGEN
		They'll cut the cake in a few
		minutes...leave right after that.
		Your new son-in-law, do we give him
		something important?

				DON CORLEONE
		No, give him a living.  But never
		let him know the family's business.
		What else, Tom?

				HAGEN
		I've called the hospital; they've
		notified Consiglere Genco's family
		to come and wait.  He won't last
		out the night.

	This saddens the DON.  He sighs.

				DON CORLEONE
		Genco will wait for me.  Santino,
		tell your brothers they will come
		with me to the hospital to see
		Genco.  Tell Fredo to drive the big
		car, and ask Johnny to come with us.

				SONNY
		And Michael?

				DON CORLEONE
		All my sons.
			  (to HAGEN)
		Tom, I want you to go to California
		tonight.  Make the arrangements.
		But don't leave until I come back
		from the hospital and speak to you.
		Understood?

				HAGEN
		Understood.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	Now all the wedding GUESTS excitedly clap their hands over
	the entrance of the cake: NAZORINE is beaming as he wheels
	in a serving table containing the biggest, gaudiest, most
	extravagant wedding cake ever baked, an incredible monument
	of his gratitude.  The CROWD is favorably impressed: they
	begin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses,
	in the traditional request for the Bride to cut the cake and
	kiss the Groom.  Louder and louder, five hundred forks
	hitting five hundred glasses.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	Silence.

	HIGH ANGLE ON THE MALL, late day.  The GUESTS are gone.  A
	single black car is in the courtyard.  FREDDIE is behind the
	driver's seat: the DON enters the car, looks at MICHAEL, who
	sits between SONNY and JOHNNY in the rear seat.

				DON CORLEONE
		Will your girl friend get back to
		the city all right?

				MICHAEL
		Tom said he'd take care of it.

	The DON pulls the door shut; and the car pulls out, through
	the gate of the great Corleone Mall.

	INT DAY: HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (SUMMER 1945)

	A long white hospital corridor, at the end of which we can
	see a grouping of FIVE WOMEN, some old and some young, but
	all plump and dressed in black.

	DON CORLEONE and his SONS move toward the end.  But then the
	DON slows, putting his hand on MICHAEL's shoulder.  MICHAEL
	stops and turns toward his FATHER.  The two looks at one
	another for some time.  SILENCE.  DON CORLEONE then lifts
	his hand, and slowly touches a particular medal on MICHAEL's
	uniform.

				DON CORLEONE
		What was this for?

				MICHAEL
		For bravery.

				DON CORLEONE
		And this?

				MICHAEL
		For killing a man.

				DON CORLEONE
		What miracles you do for strangers.

				MICHAEL
		I fought for my country.  It was my
		choice.

				DON CORLEONE
		And now, what do you choose to do?

				MICHAEL
		I'm going to finish school.

				DON CORLEONE
		Good.  When you are finished, come
		and talk to me.  I have hopes for
		you.

	Again they regard each other without a word.  MICHAEL turns,
	and continues on.  DON CORLEONE watches a moment, and then
	follows.

	INT DAY: HOSPITAL ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE enters the hospital room, moving closest to OUR
	VIEW.  He is followed by his SONS, JOHNNY and the WOMEN.

				DON CORLEONE
			  (whispered)
		Genco, I've brought my sons to pay
		their respects.  And look, even
		Johnny Fontane, all the way from
		Hollywood.

	GENCO is a tiny, wasted skeleton of a man.  DON CORLEONE
	takes his bony hand, as the others arrange themselves around
	his bed, each clasping the other hand in turn.

				GENCO
		Godfather, Godfather, it's your
		daughter's wedding day, you cannot
		refuse me.  Cure me, you have the
		power.

				DON CORLEONE
		I have no such power...but Genco,
		don't fear death.

				GENCO
			  (with a sly wink)
		It's been arranged, then?

				DON CORLEONE
		You blaspheme.  Resign yourself.

				GENCO
		You need your old Consigliere.  Who
		will replace me?
			  (suddenly)
		Stay with me Godfather.  Help me
		meet death.  If he sees you, he
		will be frightened and leave me in
		peace.  You can say a word, pull a
		few strings, eh?  We'll outwit that
		bastard as we outwitted all those
		others.
			  (clutching his hand)
		Godfather, don't betray me.

	The DON motions all the others to leave the room.  They do.
	He returns his attention to GENCO, holding his hand and
	whispering things we cannot hear, as they wait for death.

	INT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)

	FADE IN:

	The interior of a non-stop Constellation.  HAGEN is one of
	the very few passengers on this late flight.  He looks like
	any young lawyer on a business trip.  He is tired from the
	difficult preparation and duties that he has just executed
	during the wedding.  On the seat next to him is an enormous,
	bulging briefcase.  He closes his eyes.

	INT NIGHT: HONEYMOON HOTEL (SUMMER 1945)

	The honeymoon hotel: CARLO and CONNIE.  CARLO is in his
	undershorts, sitting up on the bed, anxiously taking the
	envelopes out of the silk bridal purse and counting the
	contents.  CONNIE prepares herself in the large marble
	bathroom.  She rubs her hands over his bronze shoulders, and
	tries to get his interest.

	INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE in his office.  LUCA BRASI sitting near to him.

				DON CORLEONE
		Luca, I am worried about this man
		Sollozzo.  Find out what you can,
		through the Tattaglias.  Let them
		believe you could be tempted away
		from the Corleone Family, if the
		right offer was made.  Learn what
		he has under his fingernails...

	INT NIGHT: MANCINI APT. HALL (SUMMER 1945)

	The hallway of an apartment building.  SONNY enters, climbs
	two steps at a time.  He knocks, and then whispers.

				SONNY
		It's me, Sonny.

	The door opens, and two lovely arms are around him, pulling
	him into the apartment.

	INT NIGHT: LUCA'S ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA BRASI's tiny room.  He is partly dressed.  He kneels
	and reaches under his bed and pulls out a small, locked
	trunk.  He opens it, and takes out a heavy, bullet-proof
	vest.  He puts it on, over his wool undershirt, and then
	puts on his shirt and jacket.  He takes his gun, quickly
	disassembles, checks, and reassembles it.  And leaves.

	INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	A CLOSE VIEW of DON CORLEONE thinking quietly.

	INT NIGHT: MOVING TRAIN (SUMMER 1945)

	MICHAEL and KAY on a train, speeding on their way to New
	Hampshire.

	INT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA, in his bulky jacket, sitting quietly on an empty
	subway train.

	INT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)

	HAGEN on the Constellation.  He reaches into his briefcase,
	and takes out several pictures and papers.

	One photograph is of a smiling man, JACK WOLTZ, linked arm
	in arm with fifteen movie stars on either side, including a
	lovely young child star to his immediate right.

	HAGEN considers other papers.

	INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE looks, and then moves HAGEN into an embrace.
	He straightens his arms and looks at TOM deeply.

				DON CORLEONE
		Remember my new Consigliere, a
		lawyer with his briefcase can steal
		more than a hundred men with guns.

	EXT DAY: WOLTZ ESTATE GATE (SUMMER 1945)

	JACK WOLTZ ESTATE.  HAGEN stands before the impressive gate,
	armed only with his briefcase.  A GATEMAN opens the gate,
	and TOM enters.

	EXT DAY: WOLTZ GARDENS (SUMMER 1945)

	HAGEN and WOLTZ comfortably stroll along beautiful formal
	gardens, martinis in hand.

				WOLTZ
		You should have told me your boss
		was Corleone, Tom, I had to check
		you out.  I thought you were just
		some third rate hustler Johnny was
		running in to bluff me.
			  (a piece of statuary)
		Florence, thirteenth century.
		Decorated the garden of a king.

	They cross the garden and head toward the stables.

				WOLTZ
		I'm going to show you something
		beautiful.

	They pass the stables, and come to rest by a stall with a
	huge bronze plaque attached to the outside wall: "KHARTOUM."
	TWO SECURITY GUARDS are positioned in chairs nearby; they
	rise as WOLTZ approaches.

				WOLTZ
		You like horses?  I like horses, I
		love 'em.  Beautiful, expensive
		Racehorses.

	The animal inside is truly beautiful.  WOLTZ whispers to him
	with true love in his voice.

				WOLTZ
		Khartoum...Kartoum...You are
		looking at six hundred thousand
		dollars on four hoofs.  I bet even
		Russian Czars never paid that kind
		of dough for a single horse.  But
		I'm not going to race him I'm going
		to put him out to Stud.

	INT NIGHT: WOLTZ DINING ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

	HAGEN and WOLTZ sit at an enormous dining room table,
	attended by SEVERAL SERVANTS.  Great paintings hang on the
	walls.  The meal is elaborate and sumptuous.

				HAGEN
		Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather.
		That is very close, a very sacred
		religious relationship.

				WOLTZ
		Okay, but just tell him this is one
		favor I can't give.  But he should
		try me again on anything else.

				HAGEN
		He never asks a second favor when
		he has been refused the first.
		Understood?

				WOLTZ
		You smooth son of a bitch, let me
		lay it on the line for you, and
		your boss.  Johnny Fontane never
		gets that movie.  I don't care how
		many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball
		Goombahs come out of the woodwork!

				HAGEN
		I'm German-Irish.

				WOLTZ
		Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny
		will never get that part because I
		hate that pinko punk and I'm going
		to run him out of the Movies.  And
		I'll tell you why.  He ruined one
		of Woltz Brothers' most valuable
		proteges.  For five years I had
		this girl under training; singing
		lessons!  Acting lessons!  Dancing
		lessons!  We spent hundreds of
		thousands of dollars--I was going
		to make her a star.  I'll be even
		more frank, just to show you that
		I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it
		wasn't all dollars and cents.  That
		girl was beautiful and young and
		innocent and she was the greatest
		piece of ass I've ever ad and I've
		had them all over the world.  Then
		Johnny comes along with that olive
		oil voice and guinea charm and she
		runs off.  She threw it all away to
		make me look ridiculous.  A MAN IN
		MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE
		MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!

	EXT DAY: GENCO OLIVE OIL CO. (SUMMER 1945)

	An unimposing little building in New York City on Mott
	Street with a large old sign: "GENCO OLIVE OIL IMPORTS,
	INC." next to an open-faced fruit market.

	A dark Buick pulls up, and a single small man, whom we
	cannot see well because of the distance, gets out and enters
	the building.  This is VIRGIL SOLLOZZO.

	INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)

	Looking toward the staircase we can hear SOLLOZZO's footsteps
	before he actually rises into view.  He is a small man, very
	dark, with curly black hair.  But wiry, and tight and hard,
	and obviously very dangerous.  He is greeted at the head of
	the stairs by SONNY, who takes his hand and shakes it,
	introducing himself.  For a moment, there is a complex of
	handshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful
	introductions.  Finally, SOLLOZZO is taken into the DON's
	glass paneled office; the two principals are introduced.
	They are very respectful of one another.  Folding chairs are
	brought in by FREDDIE, and soon they are all sitting around
	in a circle; the DON, SOLLOZZO, SONNY, HAGEN, FREDDIE,
	CLEMENZA and TESSIO.  The DON is the slightest bit foolish
	with all his compatriots, whereas SOLLOZZO has brought no
	one.  Throughout all that transpires, however, it is clear
	that this scene is between two men: SOLLOZZO and DON CORLEONE.

				SOLLOZZO
		My business is heroin, I have poppy
		fields, laboratories in Narseilles
		and Sicily, ready to go into
		production.  My importing methods
		are as safe as these things can be,
		about five per cent loss.  The risk
		is nothing, the profits enormous.

				DON CORLEONE
		Why do you come to me?  Why do I
		deserve your generosity?

				SOLLOZZO
		I need two million dollars in
		cash...more important, I need a
		friend who has people in high
		places; a friend who can guarantee
		that if one of my employees be
		arrested, they would get only light
		sentences.  Be my friend.

				DON CORLEONE
		What percentages for my family?

				SOLLOZZO
		Thirty per cent.  In the first year
		your share would be four million
		dollars; then it would go up.

				DON CORLEONE
		And what is the percentage of the
		Tattaglia family?

	SOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN.

				SOLLOZZO
		My compliments.  I'll take care of
		them from my share.

				DON CORLEONE
		So.  I receive 30 per cent just for
		finance and legal protection.  No
		worries about operations, is that
		what you tell me?

				SOLLOZZO
		If you think two million dollars in
		cash is just finance, I congratulate
		you Don Corleone.

	There is a long silence; in which each person present feels
	the tension.  The DON is about to give his answer.

				DON CORLEONE
		I said I would see you because I've
		heard you're a serious man, to be
		treated with respect...
			  (pause)
		But I'll say no to you.

	We feel this around the room.

				DON CORLEONE
		I'll give you my reasons.  I have
		many, many friends in Politics.
		But they wouldn't be so friendly if
		my business was narcotics instead
		of gambling.  They think gambling
		is something like liquor, a harmless
		vice...and they think narcotics is
		dirty business.

	SOLLOZZO takes a breath.

				DON CORLEONE
		No...how a man makes his living is
		none of my business.  But this
		proposition of yours is too risky.
		All the people in my family lived
		well the last ten years, I won't
		risk that out of greed.

				SOLLOZZO
		Are you worried about security for
		your million?

				DON CORLEONE
		No.

				SOLLOZZO
		The Tattaglias will guarantee your
		investment also.

	This startles SONNY; he blurts out.

				SONNY
		The Tattaglia family guarantees our
		investment?

	SOLLOZZO hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face
	him.  Everyone is the room knows that SONNY has stepped out
	of line.

				DON CORLEONE
		Young people are greedy, and they
		have no manners.  They speak when
		they should listen.  But I have a
		sentimental weakness for my
		children, and I've spoiled them, as
		you see.  But Signor Sollozzo, my
		no is final.

	SOLLOZZO nods, understands that this is the dismissal.  He
	glances one last time at SONNY.  He rises; all the others do
	as well.  He bows to the DON, shakes his hand, and formally
	takes his leave.  When the footsteps can no longer be heard:

	The DON turns to SONNY.

				DON CORLEONE
		Santino, never let anyone outside
		the family know what you are
		thinking.  I think your brain is
		going soft from all that comedy you
		play with that young girl.

	TWO OFFICE WORKERS are carrying an enormous floral display
	with the word "THANK YOU" spelled out in flowers.

				DON CORLEONE
		What is this nonsense?

				HAGEN
		It's from Johnny.  It was announced
		this morning.  He's going to play
		the lead in the new Woltz Brothers
		film.

	INT DAY: WOLTZ'S BEDROOM (SUMMER 1945)

	It is large, dominated by a huge bed, in which a man,
	presumably WOLTZ, is sleeping.  Soft light bathes the room
	from the large windows.  We move closer to him until we see
	his face, and recognize JACK WOLTZ.  He turns uncomfortably;
	mutters, feels something strange in his bedsheets.  Something
	wet.

	He wakens, feels the sheets with displeasure; they are wet.
	He looks at his hand; the wetness is blood.  He is
	frightened, pulls aside the covers, and sees fresh blood on
	his sheets and pajamas.  He grunts, pulls the puddle of
	blood in his bed.  He feels his own body frantically,
	moving, down, following the blood, until he is face to face
	with the great severed head of Khartoum lying at the foot of
	his bed.  Just blood from the hacked neck.  White reedy
	tendons show.  He struggles up to his elbows in the puddle
	of blood to see more clearly.  Froth covers the muzzle, and
	the enormous eyes of the animal are yellowed and covered
	with blood.

	WOLTZ tries to scream; but cannot.  No sound comes out.
	Then, finally and suddenly an ear-splitting scream of pure
	terror escapes from WOLTZ, who is rocking on his hands and
	knees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him.

	INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)

	CLOSE VIEW on the GODFATHER.  Nodding.

				DON CORLEONE
		Send Johnny my congratulations.

	----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------

	(SCENES 12 & 12 OMITTED)

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: FIFTH AVENUE (WINTER 1945)

	Fifth Avenue in the snow.  Christmas week.  People are
	bundled up with rosy faces, rushing to buy presents.

	KAY and MICHAEL exit a Fifth Avenue department store,
	carrying a stack of gaily wrapped gifts, arm in arm.

				KAY
		We have something for your mother,
		for Sonny, we have the tie for
		Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the
		Reynolds pen...

				MICHAEL
		And what do you want for Christmas?

				KAY
		Just you.

	They kiss.

	INT DAY: HOTEL ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	CLOSE ON a wooden radio, playing quiet Music.  THE VIEW PANS
	AROUND the dark hotel room, curtained against the daylight.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		We'll have a quiet, civil ceremony
		at the City Hall, no big fuss, no
		family, just a couple of friends as
		witnesses.

	The two are in each other's arms in a mess of bedsheets on
	the two single beds that they have pushed together.

				KAY
		What will your father say?

				MICHAEL
		As long as I tell him beforehand he
		won't object.  He'll be hurt, but
		he won't object.

				KAY
		What time do they expect us?

				MICHAEL
		For dinner.  Unless I call and tell
		them we're still in New Hampshire.

				KAY
		Michael.

				MICHAEL
		Then we can have dinner, see a
		show, and spend one more night.

	He moves to the telephone.

				MICHAEL (CONT'D.)
		Operator.  Get me
			  (fill in number)


				KAY
		Michael, what are you doing?

				MICHAEL
		Shhh, you be the long distance
		operator.  Here.

				KAY
		Hello...this is Long Distance.  I
		have a call from New Hampshire.  Mr.
		Michael Corleone.  One moment please.

	She hands the phone to MICHAEL who continues the deception.

				MICHAEL
		Hello, Tom?  Michael.  Yeah...
		listen, we haven't left yet.  I'm
		driving down to the city with Kay
		tomorrow morning.  There's something
		important I want to tell the old
		man before Christmas.  Will he be
		home tomorrow night?

	INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	HAGEN in the Olive Oil Company office.  In the background,
	through the glass partitions, we can see the DON, at work in
	his office.  TOM is tired, and steeped in paperwork.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		Sure.  Anything I can do for you.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas.
		Everyone's going to be out at Long
		Beach, right?

				HAGEN
		Right.

	He smiles.  MICHAEL has hung up.  He looks at the piles of
	work, and can't face it.  He rises, puts on his coat and
	hat, and continues out.

	He peeks into the DON's office.

				HAGEN
		Michael called; he's not leaving
		New Hampshire until tomorrow
		morning.  I've got to go, I promised
		Theresa I'd pick up some toys for
		the kids.

	The DON smiles and nods.

	TOM smiles, and leaves; OUR VIEW remaining with DON CORLEONE.
	FREDDIE is sitting on a bench in the corner, reading the
	afternoon paper.  He puts aside the papers the office
	manager has prepared for him, and then moves to FREDDIE,
	raps his knuckles on his head to take his nose out of the
	paper.

				DON CORLEONE
		Tell Paulie to get the car from the
		lot; I'll be ready to go home in a
		few minutes.

				FREDO
		I'll have to get it myself; Paulie
		called in sick this morning.

				DON CORLEONE
		That's the third time this month.
		I think maybe you'd better get a
		healthier bodyguard for me.  Tell
		Tom.

				FREDO
			  (going)
		Paulie's a good kid.  If he's sick,
		he's sick.  I don't mind getting
		the car.

	FREDDIE leaves.  He slowly puts on his jacket.  Looks out
	his window.

	EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

	FREDDIE crosses the street.

	INT DUSK: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

				OFFICE MANAGER
		Buon Watale, Don Corleone.

	The MANAGER helps him on with his overcoat.  Once again, the
	DON glances out his window.

	The black car pulls up; FREDDIE driving.

				DON CORLEONE
		Merry Christmas.
			  (handing the MANAGER
			  an envelope)


	And he starts down the stairs.

	EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

	The light outside is very cold, and beginning to fail.  When
	FREDDIE sees his FATHER coming, he moves back into the
	driver's seat.  The DON moves to the car, and is about to
	get in when he hesitates, and turns back to the long, open
	fruit stand near the corner.

	The PROPRIETOR springs to serve him.  The DON walks among
	the trays and baskets, and merely points to a particular
	piece of fruit.  As he selects, the MAN gingerly picks the
	pieces of fruit up and puts them into a paper bag.  The DON
	pays with a five dollar bill, waits for his change, and then
	turns back to the car.

	EXT DUSK: POLKS TOY STORE (WINTER 1945)

	TOM HAGEN exits carrying a stack of presents, all gift
	wrapped.  He continues past the windows.  As he walks,
	someone walks right in his way.  He looks up.  It is SOLLOZZO.

	He takes TOM by the arm and walks along with him.

				SOLLOZZO
			  (quietly)
		Don't be frightened.  I just want
		to talk to you.

	A car parked at the curb suddenly flings its rear door open.

				SOLLOZZO
			  (urgently)
		Get in; I want to talk to you.

	HAGEN pulls his arm free.  He is frightened.

				HAGEN
		I haven't got time.

	TWO MEN suddenly appear on either side of him.

				SOLLOZZO
		Get in the car.  If I wanted to
		kill you you'd be dead already.
		Trust me.

	HAGEN, sick to his stomach, moves with his ESCORTS, leaving
	our VIEW on the Mechanical windows gaily bobbing the story
	of Hansel and Gretel.  We HEAR the car doors shut, and the
	car drive off.

	EXT NIGHT: RADIO CITY - PHONE BOOTH (WINTER 1945)

	RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL during the Christmas show.  KAY and
	MICHAEL exit; tears are still streaming down her cheeks, and
	she sniffles, and dries her tears with Kleenex.  KAY
	nostalgically hums "The Bells of Saint Mary's," as they walk
	arm in arm.

				KAY
		Would you like me better if I were
		a nun?

				MICHAEL
		No.

				KAY
		Would you like me better if I were
		Ingrid Bergman?

	They have passed a little enclosed newsstand.  KAY sees
	something that terrifies her.  She doesn't know what to do.
	MICHAEL still walks, thinking about her question.

				KAY
			  (a little voice)
		Michael?

				MICHAEL
		I'm thinking about it.

				KAY
		Michael...

				MICHAEL
		No, I would not like you better if
		you were Ingrid Bergman.

	She cannot answer him.  Rather she pulls him by the arm,
	back to the newsstand, and points.  His face goes grave.

	The headlines read: "VITO CORLEONE SHOT, CHIEFTAN GUNNED
	DOWN."

	MICHAEL is petrified; quickly he takes each edition, drops a
	dollar in the tray, and hungrily reads through them.  KAY
	knows to remain silent.

				MICHAEL
			  (desperately)
		They don't say if he's dead or alive.

	EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE by the fruit stand; he is about to move to the
	car, when TWO MEN step from the corner.  Suddenly, the DON
	drops the bag of fruit and darts with startling quickness
	toward the parked car.

				DON CORLEONE
		Fredo, Fredo!

	The paper bag has hit the ground, and the fruit begins
	rolling along the sidewalk, as we HEAR gunshots.

	Five bullets catch the DON in the back; he arches in pain,
	and continues toward the car.

	The PROPRIETOR of the fruit stand rushes for cover, knocking
	over an entire case of fruit.

	The TWO GUNMEN move in quickly, anxious to finish him off.

	Their feet careful to avoid the rolling fruit.  There are
	more GUNSHOTS.

	FREDDIE is hysterical; he tries to get out of the car;
	having difficulty opening the door.  He rushes out, a gun
	trembling in his hand; his mouth open.  He actually drops
	the gun.

	The gun falls amid the rolling fruit.

	The GUNMEN are panicked.  They fire once more at the downed
	DON CORLEONE.  His leg and arm twitch where they are hit;
	and pools of blood are beginning to form.

	The GUNMEN are obviously in a state of panic and confusion;
	they disappear around the corner as quickly as they came.

	The PEOPLE about the avenue have all but disappeared:
	rather, we catch glimpses of them, poking their heads safely
	from around corners, inside doorways and arches, and from
	windows.  But the street itself is now empty.

	FREDDIE is in shock; he looks at his FATHER; now great
	puddles of blood have formed, and the DON is lifeless and
	face down in them.

	FREDDIE falls back on to the curb and sits there, saying
	something we cannot understand.  He begins to weep profusely.

	INT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA BRASI riding alone on a subway car, late at night.  He
	gets off.

	He emerges at a subway terminal, proceeds out.

	EXT NITE: NIGHT CLUB STREET (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA walks down the late night street.  He approaches an
	elegant New York Nightclub, whose gaudy neon sign is still
	winking this late at night.  He waits and watches.  Then the
	sign goes out; and he proceeds into the club.

	INT NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)

	The main floor of the Nightclub is very large, with endless
	glistening wooden floors.  Now, at this late time, the
	chairs have been stacked on the tables and a NEGRO JANITOR
	is waxing them.  A single HAT-CHECK GIRL is counting her
	receipts.  LUCA moves past the empty bandstand, and sits at
	the bar.  ANOTHER MAN, dark and very well-built, moves
	behind the bar.

				MAN
		Luca...I'm Bruno Tattaglia.

				LUCA
		I know.

	LUCA looks up; and out of the shadows emerges SOLLOZZO.

				SOLLOZZO
		Do you know who I am?

	LUCA Nods.

				SOLLOZZO
		You've been talking to the
		Tattaglias.  They thought we could
		do business.

	LUCA listens.

				SOLLOZZO
		I need somebody strong to protect
		my operation, physically.  I've
		heard you're not happy with your
		family, you might make a switch.

				LUCA
		If the money is good enough.

				SOLLOZZO
		On the first shipment, I can
		guarantee you fifty thousand dollars.

	LUCA looks at him; he had no idea the offer would be so good.

	SOLLOZZO extends his hand, but LUCA pretends not to see it,
	rather, he busies himself putting a cigarette in his mouth.
	BRUNO TATTAGLIA, behind the bar, makes a cigarette lighter
	magically appear, and holds it to LUCA's cigarette.  Then,
	he does an odd thing; he drops the lighter on the bar, and
	puts his hand lightly on LUCA's, almost patting it.

	INT NITE: SONNY'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	The telephone in SONNY's house is ringing.  He approaches
	it, obviously fresh from a nap.

				SONNY
		Yeah.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Do you recognize my voice?

				SONNY
		I think so.  Detective squad?

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Right.  Don't say my name, just
		listen.  Somebody shot your father
		outside his place fifteen minutes
		ago.

				SONNY
		Is he alive?

				VOICE (O.S.)
		I think so, but I can't get close
		enough.  There's a lot of blood.
		I'll try to find out more.

				SONNY
		Find out anything you can...you got
		a Grand coming.
			  (click)


	SONNY cradles the phone.  An incredible rage builds up in
	him, his face actually turning red.  He would like to rip
	the phone to pieces in his bare hands.  Then he controls it.
	Quickly, he dials another number.

				SONNY
		Theresa, let me talk to Tom.  Not
		yet?  Have him call me as soon as
		he gets home.

	He hangs up.

				SANDRA (O.S.)
		Sonny?  Sonny, who is it?
			  (she enters the room)
		What is it?

				SONNY
			  (calmly)
		They shot the old man.

				SANDRA
		Oh God...

				SONNY
		Honey...don't worry.  Nothing else
		is going to happen.

	There is a POUNDING on the door.  A BABY starts crying.

				SANDRA
			  (really frightened)
		SONNY?

	SONNY reaches into a cabinet drawer, takes out a gun, and
	moves quickly.  He opens the front door quickly.  It is
	CLEMENZA.  He enters, SONNY closes the door.  SANDRA goes to
	look after the baby.

				CLEMENZA
			  (excited)
		You heard about your father?

				SONNY
		Yeah.

				CLEMENZA
		The word is out in the streets that
		he's dead.

				SONNY
		Where the hell was Paulie, why
		wasn't he with the Don?

				CLEMENZA
		Paulie's been a little sick all
		winter...he was home.

				SONNY
		How many times did he stay home the
		last couple of months?

				CLEMENZA
		Maybe three, four times.  I always
		asked Freddie if he wanted another
		bodyguard, but he said no.  Things
		have been so smooth the last ten
		years...

				SONNY
		Go get Paulie, I don't care how
		sick he is.  Pick him up yourself,
		and bring him to my father's house.

				CLEMENZA
		That's all?  Don't you want me to
		send some people over here?

				SONNY
		No, just you and Paulie.

	CLEMENZA leaves; SONNY moves to SANDRA, who sits on the
	couch weeping quietly, comforting her BABY.

				SONNY
		A couple of our people will come to
		stay here.  Do whatever they say;
		I'm going over to the main house.
		If you want me, use Pop's special
		phone.

	The telephone rings again.  SONNY answers it.

				SONNY
		Hello.

				SOLLOZZO (O.S.)
		Santino Corleone?

	SANDRA moves behind him, anxious to know who it is.  SONNY
	indicates that she be quiet.

				SONNY
		Yeah.

				SOLLOZZO (O.S.)
		We have Tom Hagen.  In about three
		hours he'll be released with our
		proposition.  Don't do anything
		until you've heard what he has to
		say.  You can only cause a lot of
		trouble.  What's done is done.
			  (a pause)
		Don't lose that famous temper of
		yours.

				SONNY
			  (quietly)
		I'll wait.

	EXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)

	FULL VIEW OF THE CORLEONE MALL.  It is night, but the
	courtyard is bathed with white light from floodlights on the
	tops of all the houses.  It is very cold.  We see the figure
	of SONNY cross the Mall, and let himself into the main house.

	INT NITE: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)

	SONNY walks into the empty, darkened house.  Then he calls
	out.

				SONNY
		Ma?  Ma, where are you.

	The kitchen door swings open.  He moves quickly and takes
	her by the arm.  He is deliberately calm.

				SONNY
		Ma, I just got a call.  Pop's
		hurt...I don't know how bad.

				MAMA
			  (quietly)
		Santino?  Have they killed him?

				SONNY
			  (almost in tears)
		We don't know yet, Ma.

				MAMA
		I'll get dressed.  In case we can
		see him...

	She moves out of the kitchen, and continues upstairs.  SONNY
	turns the gas from the pan of peppers she was frying.  He
	takes some bread without thinking, and dips it in the oil,
	and sloppily eats some of the peppers, as he moves into his
	father's office.

	INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	He switches the lights on in the DON's office.  The massive
	desk dominates the room.  SONNY moves quickly to the
	telephone, pulling a small chair to the side of the desk,
	and dials a number.

				SONNY
		Tessio...This is Santino Corleone.
		I want fifty reliable men out here.

				TESSIO (O.S.)
		I heard, Sonny...but what about
		Clemenza's regime?

				SONNY
		I don't want to use Clemenza's
		people right now.  Understood?

	He hangs up.  He moves quickly to a wall safe; operates the
	dial, and removes a small notebook.  He takes it back to the
	desk, and runs over the list of numbers with his forefinger.
	We follow the names, until the finger stops at one: LUCA
	BRASI.  SONNY dials the number.  There is no answer.

				SONNY
		Luca.

	INT NITE: BUILDING (WINTER 1945)

	The interior of an abandoned building.  SEVERAL MEN in suits
	and ties sit around in the booths.

	HAGEN sits in one: SOLLOZZO sits across from him.

				SOLLOZZO
		I know you're not in the muscle end
		of the family--so I don't want you
		to be afraid.  I want you to help
		the Corleones and I want you to
		help me.

	HAGEN's hands are trembling as he tries to put a cigarette
	in his mouth.  ONE of the BUTTON MEN brings a bottle of rye
	to the table, and pours a little into a delicate, flowered
	china cup.  HAGEN sips gratefully.

				SOLLOZZO
		Your boss is dead...

	HAGEN is overwhelmed: actual tears spring to his eyes.
	SOLLOZZO pauses respectfully.

				SOLLOZZO
			  (pushing the bottle)
		Have some more.  We got him outside
		his office, just before I picked
		you up.  You have to make the peace
		between me and Santino.

	HAGEN still is focused on the grief of losing the old man.

				SOLLOZZO
		Sonny was hot for my deal, right?
		You know it's the smart thing to
		do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny
		into it.

				HAGEN
			  (pulling himself together)
		Sonny will come after you with
		everything he's got.

	SOLLOZZO rises, impatiently.

				SOLLOZZO
		That's going to be his first
		reaction.  You have to talk some
		sense into him.  The Tattaglia
		family stands behind me with all
		their people.  The other New York
		Families will go along with anything
		that prevents a full scale war.

	He leans close to HAGEN.

				SOLLOZZO
		The Don was slipping; in the old
		days I could never have gotten to
		him.  Now he's dead, nothing can
		bring him back.  Talk to Sonny,
		talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza
		and Tessio...it's good business.

				HAGEN
		Even Sonny won't be able to call
		off Luca Brasi.

				SOLLOZZO
		I'll worry about Luca.  You take
		care of Sonny and the other two kids.

				HAGEN
		I'll try...It's what the Don would
		want us to do.

				SOLLOZZO
			  (lifting his hands in
			  an expression of harmlessness)
		Good...then you can go...
			  (he escorts him to
			  the door)
		I don't like violence.  I'm a
		businessman, and blood is a big
		expense.

	He opens the door; they step out together.

	EXT NITE: BUILDING

	HAGEN, SOLLOZZO exit.

	But a car pulls up, and ONE of SOLLOZZO'S MEN rushes out.
	He indicates with some urgency that he wants to talk to
	SOLLOZZO in private.

	Then SOLLOZZO moves with a grave expression.  He opens the
	door, indicating that HAGEN should be led back in.

				SOLLOZZO
		The old man is still alive.  Five
		bullets in his Sicilian hide and
		he's still alive.
			  (he gives a fatalistic
			  shrug)
		Bad luck for me, bad luck for you.

	EXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL driving during the night.  There is a little fog in
	the air, and moisture has formed on the windshield, making
	it difficult to see well.  The wipers move across the view,
	as the gate of the Corleone Mall appears before us, still
	decorated for Christmas.  The courtyard is bathed with white
	floodlight, giving this place a cold and isolated look.  The
	narrow entrance mouth of the Mall is sealed off with a link
	chain.  There are strange cars parked along the curving
	cement walk.  SEVERAL MEN are congregated about the gate and
	chain; ONE of them approaches MICHAEL's car.

				MAN
		Who're you?

	ANOTHER peeks his ugly face almost right up to MICHAEL, and
	then turns.

				MAN 2
		It's the Don's kid; take the car,
		I'll bring him inside.

	The FIRST MAN opens the car door, and MICHAEL steps out.

	INT NITE: HALL (WINTER 1945)

	The Hallway of the main house is filled with MEN MICHAEL
	doesn't recognize.  They pay little attention to him.  Most
	of them are waiting; sitting uncomfortably; no one is talking.

	INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL moves into the living room; there is a Christmas
	tree, and countless greeting cards taped to the walls.

	THERESA HAGEN is sitting stiffly on the sofa, smoking a
	cigarette; on the coffee table in front of her is a water
	glass half filled with whiskey.  On the other side of the
	sofa sits CLEMENZA; his face is impassive, but he is
	sweating, and the cigar in his hand glistens slickly black
	with his saliva.  PAULIE GATTO sits tensely and alone on the
	other side of the room.  CLEMENZA sees MICHAEL, looks up at
	him.

				CLEMENZA
		Your mother's at the hospital with
		the old man: He's gonna pull through.

	MICHAEL nods his relief.

				MICHAEL
		Thanks.

	He moves to THERESA.

				MICHAEL
			  (gently)
		You heard from Tom yet?

	Without looking up, she clings to him for a moment, and
	trembles.  Occasionally, STRANGE MEN will cross through the
	room; everyone speaks in a whisper.

				MICHAEL
			  (taking her hand)
		C'mon.

	He leads her into his father's office without knocking.

	INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	SONNY and TESSIO are huddled around a yellow pad.  They look
	up, startled.

				SONNY
		Don't worry, Theresa; they just
		want to give Tom the proposition,
		then they're going to turn him loose.

	He reassuringly hugs THERESA, and then to MICHAEL's surprise,
	he kisses him on the cheek.

				SONNY
		I was worried when we couldn't get
		in touch with you in that hick town.

				MICHAEL
		How's Mom?

				SONNY
		Good.  She's been through it before.
		Me too.  You were too young to know
		about it.  You better wait outside;
		there're some things you shouldn't
		hear.

				MICHAEL
		I can help you out...

				SONNY
		Oh no you can't, the old man'd be
		sore as hell if I let you get mixed
		up in this.

				MICHAEL
		Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.

				SONNY
		Theresa.

	She understands, and leaves them alone.

				SONNY
		All right, Mikey...who do we have
		to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?

				MICHAEL
		What?

				SONNY
		One of them fingered the old man.

	MICHAEL didn't realize that the men waiting outside were on
	trial for their lives.

				MICHAEL
		Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.

				SONNY
		You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay.
		It was Paulie.

				MICHAEL
		How can you be sure?

				SONNY
		On the three days Paulie was sick
		this month, he got calls from a
		payphone across from the old man's
		building.  We got people in the
		phone company.
			  (he shrugs)
		Thank God it was Paulie...we'll
		need Clemenza bad.

	MICHAEL is just realizing the gravity and extent of the
	situation.

				MICHAEL
		Is it going to be all-out war, like
		last time?

				SONNY
		Until the old man tells me different.

				MICHAEL
		Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.

				SONNY
		Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't
		care what it costs.  I don't care
		if we have to fight all the five
		families in New York.  The Tattaglia
		family's going to eat dirt.  I
		don't care if we all go down
		together.

				MICHAEL
			  (softly)
		That's not how Pop would have
		played it.

				SONNY
		I know I'm not the man he was.  But
		I'll tell you this and he'll tell
		you too.  When it comes to real
		action, I can operate as good as
		anybody short range.

				MICHAEL
			  (calmly)
		All right, Sonny.  All right.

				SONNY
		Christ, if I could only contact Luca.

				MICHAEL
		Is it like they say?  Is he that
		good?

	Outside, we HEAR THERESA cry out, almost a scream of relief.
	Then open the door and rush out.

	Everyone is standing: in the doorway, TOM HAGEN is wrapped
	in a tight embrace with his WIFE.

				HAGEN
		If I plead before the Supreme
		Court, I'll never do better than I
		did tonight with that Turk.

	EXT NITE: MALL, FEATURING DON'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)

	The windows of the main house are dark except for the DON's
	study.  It stands out against the cold, dark night.

	INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	The living room is empty, save for PAULIE GATTO sitting on
	the edge of the sofa.  The clock reads: 4:00 a.m.

	INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	SONNY, MICHAEL, HAGEN, CLEMENZA and TESSIO; all exhausted,
	in shirtsleeves, about to fall asleep.  It is four in the
	morning; there is evidence of many cups of coffee and many
	snacks.  They can barely talk anymore.

				HAGEN
		Is the hospital covered?

				SONNY
		The cops have it locked in and I
		got my people there visiting Pop
		all the time.  What about the hit
		list.

	HAGEN widens his sleepy eyes, and looks at the yellow pad.

				HAGEN
		Too much, too far, too personal.
		The Don would consider this all
		purely a business dispute: Get rid
		of Sollozzo, and everything falls
		in line.  YOU don't have to go
		after the Tattaglias.

	CLEMENZA nods.

				HAGEN
		What about Luca?  Sollozzo didn't
		seem worried about Luca.  That
		worries me.

				SONNY
		If Luca sold out we're in real
		trouble.

				HAGEN
		Has anyone been able to get in
		touch with him?

				SONNY
		No, and I've been calling all night.
		Maybe he's shacked up.

				HAGEN
		Luca never sleeps over with a broad.
		He always goes home when he's
		through.  Mike, keep ringing Luca's
		number.

	MICHAEL, very tired, picks up the phone, and dials the
	number once again.  He can hear the phone ringing on the
	other end but no one answers.  Then hangs up.

				HAGEN
		Keep trying every fifteen minutes.
			  (exhausted)


				SONNY
		Tom, you're the Consigliere, what
		do we do if the old man dies?

				HAGEN
		Without your father's political
		contacts and personal influence,
		the Corleone family loses half its
		strength.  Without your father, the
		other New York families might wind
		up supporting Sollozzo, and the
		Tattaglias just to make sure there
		isn't a long destructive war.  The
		old days are over, this is 1946;
		nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If
		your father dies...make the deal,
		Sonny.

				SONNY
			  (angry)
		That's easy to say; it's not your
		father.

				HAGEN
			  (quietly)
		I was as good a son to him as you
		or Mike.

				SONNY
		Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it
		that way.

				HAGEN
		We're all tired...

				SONNY
		OK, we sit tight until the old man
		can give us the lead.  But Tom, I
		want you to stay inside the Mall.
		You too, Mike, no chances.  Tessio,
		you hold your people in reserve,
		but have them nosing around the
		city.  The hospital is yours; I
		want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours
		a day.

	There is a timid knock on the door.

				SONNY
		What is it?

	PAULIE GATTO looks in.

				CLEMENZA
		I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...

				PAULIE
		The guy at the gate's outside...says
		there's a package...

				SONNY
		Tessio, see what it is.

	TESSIO gets up, leaves.

				PAULIE
		You want me to hang around?

				SONNY
		Yeah.  Hang around.

				PAULIE
		Outside?

				CLEMENZA
		Outside.

				PAULIE
		Sure.

	He closes the door.

				SONNY
		Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie.
		I don't ever want to see him again.
		Understood?

				CLEMENZA
		Understood.

				SONNY
		Okay, now you can move your men
		into the Mall, replace Tessio's
		people.  Mike, tomorrow you take a
		couple of Clemenza's people and go
		to Luca's apartment and wait for
		him to show.  That crazy bastard
		might be going after Sollozzo right
		now if he's heard the news.

				HAGEN
		Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up
		in this so directly.  You know the
		old man doesn't want that.

				SONNY
		OK forget it, just stay on the phone.

	MICHAEL is embarrassed to be so protected.  He dials Luca
	Brasi's number once again.  The ring repeats, but no one
	answers.

	TESSIO comes back, carrying Luca Brasi's bullet-proof vest
	in his hand.  He unwraps it; there is a large fish wrapped
	inside.

				CLEMENZA
		A Sicilian message: Luca Brasi
		sleeps with the fishes.

	INT. NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA sits at the Bar of the Tattaglia Nightclub, as we
	remember him.  BRUNO TATTAGLIA had just patted his hand.
	LUCA looks up at him.

	Then SOLLOZZO pats the other hand, almost affectionately.
	LUCA is just about to twist his hands away, when they both
	clamp down as hard as they can.  Suddenly, a garrote is
	thrown around his neck, and pulled violently tight.  His
	face begins to turn to purple blotches, and then totally
	purple, right before our eyes; his tongue hangs out, in a
	far more extreme way than a normal tongue could.  His eyes
	bulge.

	ONE of the MEN looks down at him in disgust as LUCA's
	strength leaves him.

				BRUNO
			  (making an ugly face)
		Oh Christ...all over the floor.

	SOLLOZZO lets LUCA's hand go with a victorious smile on his
	face.

	LUCA falls to the floor.

				SOLLOZZO
		The Godfather is next.

	----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)

	Morning in a simple Brooklyn suburb.  There are rows of
	pleasant houses; driveway after driveway, down the block.  A
	dark, somber young man of thirty-one or two walks with a
	noticeable limp down the sidewalk, and rings the bell.  This
	is ROCCO LAMPONE.  The woman of the house, MRS. CLEMENZA,
	talks to him through the screen door, and then points to the
	side of the house.  ROCCO moves to the garage, which is
	specially heated, and in which CLEMENZA is busy at work
	washing a shiny brand new Lincoln.  LAMPONE admires the car.

				LAMPONE
		Nice.

				CLEMENZA
		Crazy Detroit delivered it with a
		wooden bumper.  They're going to
		send me the chrome bumpers in a
		couple months.  I waited two years
		for this car to come with wooden
		bumpers!

	He scrubs and polishes with great affection.

				CLEMENZA
		Today you make your bones on Paulie.
		You understand everything?

				LAMPONE
		Sure.

	As he scrubs around the glove compartment, he opens it,
	unwraps a gun and gives it to LAMPONE.

				CLEMENZA
		.22 soft-nosed load.  Accurate up
		to five feet.

	LAMPONE expertly puts the gun away.  GATTO's car pulls into
	the driveway, and he sounds the horn.

	The two men walk to the car.  GATTO is driving, a bit
	nervous, like he doesn't know what is up.  LAMPONE gets in
	the rear seat; CLEMENZA in the front, making a grunt of
	recognition.  He looks at his wristwatch, as though wanting
	to chide PAULIE for being late.  PAULIE flinches a little
	when he sees LAMPONE will ride behind him; he half turns:

				PAULIE
		Rocco, sit on the other side.  A
		big guy like you blocks my rearview
		mirror.

	CLEMENZA turns sourly to PAULIE.

				CLEMENZA
		Goddamn Sonny.  He's running scared.
		He's already thinking of going to
		the mattresses.  We have to find a
		place on the West Side.  Paulie,
		you know a good location?

	PAULIE relaxes a bit; he thinks he's off any possible hook
	he was on.  Also there's the money he can make by selling
	Sollozzo any secret location.

				PAULIE
		I'll think about it.

				CLEMENZA
			  (grunting)
		Drive while you thinking; I wanna
		get to the City this month!

	The car pulls out.

	EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR - ON ROAD (WINTER 1945)

	Inside PAULIE drives; and CLEMENZA sits in a grump.  OUR
	VIEW does not show LAMPONE in the rear seat.

	EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)

	The Car crosses to the Midtown Tunnel in the late Winter
	light.

	INT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR IN TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)

	Inside the tunnel; GATTO doesn't like not seeing LAMPONE.
	He tries to adjust his rearview mirror to catch a glimpse of
	him.

				CLEMENZA
		Pay attention!

	EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

	The car is parked in the City.  PAULIE comes down from an
	available apartment and gets back into the car.

				PAULIE
		Good for ten men...

				CLEMENZA
		OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm
		suppose to call when I found
		somethin'.

	The car pulls off.

	EXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

	New part of the city; the car pulls up in a parking lot.
	CLEMENZA get outs, glances at LAMPONE, then to PAULIE.

				CLEMENZA
		You wait; I'll call.

	He walks, tucking his shirt into his pants, around the
	corner and enters the Luna Restaurant.

	INT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

	CLEMENZA enters the little restaurant, sits down at a table.
	The WAITERS know him; immediately put a bottle of wine, some
	bread--and then a plate of veal on his table.  He eats.

	EXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

	CLEMENZA exits the restaurant, belches, adjusts his pants;
	he is well fed.

	We move with him around the corner, not knowing what to
	expect has happened to Paulie.

	There is the car; PAULIE is still sitting behind the wheel,
	LAMPONE in the rear seat.  CLEMENZA steps in.

				CLEMENZA
		He talked my ear off.  Want us to
		go back to Long Beach; have another
		job for us.  Rocco, you live in the
		City, can we drop you off?

				LAMPONE (O.S.)
		Ah, I left my car at your place.

				CLEMENZA
		OK, then you gotta come back.

	The car pulls out.  By now, PAULIE is completely relaxed and
	secure.

				PAULIE
		You think we'll go for that last
		place?

				CLEMENZA
		Maybe, or you gotta know now.

				PAULIE
		Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.

	EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR ON CAUSEWAY (WINTER 1945)

	The car moves along the ready beach area of the causeway.
	Inside, CLEMENZA turns to PAULIE.

				CLEMENZA
		Paulie, pull over.  I gotta take a
		leak.

	The car pulls off the Causeway, into the reeds.  CLEMENZA
	steps out of the car, OUR VIEW MOVING with him.

	He turns his back three quarters from us (we can no longer
	see the car), unzips, and we hear the sound of urine hitting
	the ground.  We wait on this for a moment; and then there
	are two GUNSHOTS.  CLEMENZA finishes his leak, zips up and
	turns, moving back to the car.

	PAULIE is dead, bleeding from the mouth; the windows behind
	him are shattered.

				CLEMENZA
		Leave the gun.

	LAMPONE gets out, the two men walk through the reeds a few
	feet where there is another car.  They get in, and drive off.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	EXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)

	HIGH ANGLE OF THE MALL.  It is late afternoon.  Many strange
	cars are parked on the nearby streets.  We can see the group
	of BUTTON MEN, stationed here and there, obviously sentries
	with concealed weapons.

	MICHAEL walks along in the rear yard.

	He is bundled in a warm marine coat.  He looks at the
	strange men, regarding them with an uncertain awe.  They
	look back at him, at first suspiciously and then with the
	respect of his position.  He is like an exile Prince.  He
	wanders past them, and hesitates and looks at the yard.

	A rusted set of garden swings; and other home playground
	equipment.  The basketball ring now half coming off.  This
	is where he was a child.  Then a shout.

				CLEMENZA (O.S.)
		Mike.  Hey Mikey; telephone.

	CLEMENZA had shouted from the kitchen window.  MICHAEL
	hurries into the house.

	INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)

	CLEMENZA is in the kitchen, cooking over an enormous pot.
	He points to the kitchen wall phone which is hanging off the
	hook.

				CLEMENZA
		Some dame.

	MICHAEL picks it up.

				MICHAEL
		Hello.  Kay?

				KAY (O.S.)
		How is your father?

				MICHAEL
		He'll be OK.

				KAY (O.S.)
			  (pause)
		I love you.

	He glances at the THUGS in the kitchen.  Tries to shield the
	phone.

				KAY (O.S.)
		I LOVE YOU.

				MICHAEL
		Yeah Kay, I'm here.

				KAY (O.S.)
		Can you say it?

				MICHAEL
		Huh?

				KAY (O.S.)
		Tell me you love me.

	MICHAEL glances at the HOODS at the kitchen table.  He curls
	up in a corner, and in a quarter voice:

				MICHAEL
		I can't...

				KAY (O.S.)
		Please say it.

				MICHAEL
		Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?

				KAY (O.S.)
		OK.
			  (click)


	CLEMENZA is getting ready to build a tomato sauce for all
	the button men stationed around the house.

				CLEMENZA
		How come you don't tell that nice
		girl you love her...here, learn
		something... you may have to feed
		fifty guys some day.  You start
		with olive oil...fry some garlic,
		see.  And then fry some sausage...or meat
		balls if you like...then you throw
		in the tomatoes, the tomato
		paste...some basil; and a little
		red wine...that's my trick.

	SONNY peeks into the kitchen; sees CLEMENZA.

				SONNY
		You take care of Paulie?

				CLEMENZA
		You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's
		sick for good this winter.

	MICHAEL starts to leave.

				SONNY
		Where are you going?

				MICHAEL
		To the city.

				SONNY
			  (to Clemenza; dipping
			  bread into the sauce)
		Send some bodyguards.

				MICHAEL
		I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just
		going to see Pop in the hospital.
		Also, I got other things.

				CLEMENZA
		Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.

				SONNY
		OK, but be careful.

	EXT NITE: CAR

	MICHAEL sits in the rear seat, calmly, as he is being driven
	into the city.  THREE BUTTONMEN are crowded into the front
	seat.

	INT NITE: HOTEL LOBBY

	MICHAEL crosses the lobby, past lines of servicemen trying
	to book rooms.

	INT NITE: HOTEL

	MICHAEL and KAY eating a quiet dinner at the hotel.  He is
	preoccupied, she's concerned.

				MICHAEL
		Visiting hour ends at eight thirty.
		I'll just sit with him; I want to
		show respect.

				KAY
		Can I go to the hospital with you?

				MICHAEL
		I don't think so.  You don't want
		to end up on page 3 of the Daily
		News.

				KAY
		My parents don't read the Daily
		News.  All right, if you think I
		shouldn't.  I can't believe the
		things the papers are printing.
		I'm sure most of it's not true.

				MICHAEL
		I don't think so either.
			  (silence)
		I better go.

				KAY
		When will I see you again?

				MICHAEL
		I want you to go back to New
		Hampshire...think things over.

	He leans over her; kisses her.

				KAY
		When will I see you again?

				MICHAEL
		Goodbye.

	Quietly, he moves out the door.

	KAY lies on the bed a while, and then, to herself:

				KAY
		Goodbye.

	EXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)

	A taxi pulls up in front of a hospital, marked clearly with
	a neon sign "HOSPITAL--EMERGENCY."  MICHAEL steps out, pays
	the fare...and then stops dead in his tracks.

	MICHAEL looks.

	He sees the hospital in the night; but it is deserted.  He
	is the only one on the street.  There are gay, twinkling
	Christmas decorations all over the building.  He walks,
	slowly at first, and then ever so quickly, up the steps.  He
	hesitates, looks around.  This area is empty.  He checks the
	address on a scrap of paper.  It is correct.  He tries the
	door, it is empty.

	He walks in.

	INT NITE: HOSPITAL LOBBY (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL stands in the center of an absolutely empty hospital
	lobby.  He looks to the right; there is a long, empty
	corridor.  To the left: the same.

	HIGH FULL ANGLE, as MICHAEL walks through the desolated
	building lit by eerie green neon lighting.  All we hear are
	his sole footsteps.

	He walks up to a desk marked "INFORMATION".  No one is there.
	He moves quickly to a door marked "OFFICE"; swings into it;
	no one is there.  He looks onto the desk:  There is half a
	sandwich, and a half-filled bottle of coke.

				MICHAEL
		Hello?  Hello?

	Now he knows something is happening, he moves quickly,
	alertly.  MICHAEL walking down the hospital corridors; all
	alone.  The floors have just been mopped.  They are still wet.

	INT NITE: HOSPITAL STAIRS

	Now he turns onto a staircase; ever quickening; up several
	flights.

	INT NITE: 4TH FLOOR CORRIDOR

	He steps out onto the fourth floor.  He looks.  There are
	merely empty corridors.  He takes out his scrap of paper;
	checks it.  "Room 4A."  Now he hurries, trying to follow the
	code of hospital rooms; following the right arrows, quicker
	and quicker they flash by him.  Now he stops, looks up "4A--
	Corleone".

	There is a special card table set up there with some
	magazines...and some smoking cigarettes still in the
	ashtray--but no detectives, no police, no bodyguards.

	INT NITE: DON'S ROOM 4A

	Slowly he pushes the door open, almost afraid at what he
	will find.  He looks.  Lit by the moonlight through the
	window, he can see a FIGURE in the hospital bed alone in the
	room, and under a transparent oxygen tent.  All that can be
	heard is the steady though strained breathing.  Slowly
	MICHAEL walks up to it, and is relieved to see his FATHER,
	securely asleep.  Tubes hang from a steel gallows beside the
	bed, and run to his nose and mouth.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		What are you doing here?

	This startles MICHAEL; who almost jumps around.  It is a
	NURSE lit from the light behind her in the hallway.

				NURSE
		You're not supposed to be here now.

	MICHAEL calms himself, and moves to her.

				MICHAEL
		I'm Michael Corleone--this is my
		father.  What happened to the
		detectives who were guarding him?

				NURSE
		Oh your father just had too many
		visitors.  It interfered with the
		hospital service.  The police came
		and made them all leave just ten
		minutes ago.
			  (comfortingly)
		But don't worry.  I look in on him.

				MICHAEL
		You just stand here one minute...

	Quickly he moves to the telephone, dials a number.

				MICHAEL
		Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm
		down at the hospital.  I came down
		late.  There's no one here.  None
		of Tessio's people--no detectives,
		no one.  The old man is completely
		unprotected.

				SONNY (O.S.)
		All right, get him in a different
		room; lock the door from the inside.
		I'll have some men there inside of
		fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and
		don't panic.

				MICHAEL
			  (furiously, but kept inside)
		I won't panic.

	He hangs up; returns to the NURSE...

				NURSE
		You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.

				MICHAEL
			  (coldly)
		You and I are going to move my
		father right now...to another room
		on another floor...Can you
		disconnect those tubes so we can
		wheel the bed out?

				NURSE
		Absolutely not!  We have to get
		permission from the Doctor.

				MICHAEL
		You've read about my father in the
		papers.  You've seen that no one's
		here to guard him.  Now I've just
		gotten word that men are coming to
		this hospital to kill him.  Believe
		me and help me.

				NURSE
			  (frightened)
		We don't have to disconnect them,
		we can wheel the stand with the bed.

	She does so...and they perform the very difficult task of
	moving the bed and the apparatus, out of the room.

	INT NITE: 4TH FLOOR HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)

	They roll the bed, the stand, and all the tubes silently
	down the corridor.  We hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs.
	MICHAEL hears them, stops.

				MICHAEL
		Hurry, into there.

	They push it into the first available room.  MICHAEL peeks
	out from the door.  The footsteps are louder; then they
	emerge.  It is ENZO, NAZORINE's helper, carrying a bouquet
	of flowers.

				MICHAEL
			  (stepping out)
		Who is it?

				ENZO
		Michael...do you remember me, Enzo,
		the baker's helper to Nazorine, now
		his son-in-law.

				MICHAEL
		Enzo, get out of here.  There's
		going to be trouble.

	A look of fear sweeps through ENZO's face.

				ENZO
		If there...will be trouble...I stay
		with you, to help.  I owe it to the
		Godfather.

	MICHAEL thinks, realizes he needs all the help he can get.

				MICHAEL
		Go outside; stand in front...I'll
		be out in a minute.

	INT NITE: DON'S SECOND HOSPITAL ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	They part.  MICHAEL moves into the hospital room where they
	put his FATHER.

				NURSE
			  (frightened)
		He's awake.

	MICHAEL looks at the OLD MAN, his eyes are open, though he
	cannot speak.  MICHAEL touches his face tenderly.

				MICHAEL
		Pop...Pop, it's me Michael.  Shhhh,
		don't try to speak.  There are men
		who are coming to try to kill you.
		But I'm with you...I'm with you
		now...

	The OLD MAN tries to speak...but cannot.  MICHAEL tenderly
	puts his finger to his FATHER's lips.

	EXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL STREET (WINTER 1945)

	Outside the hospital is empty save for a nervous ENZO,
	pacing back and forth brandishly the flowers as his only
	weapon.  MICHAEL exits the hospital and moves to him.  They
	both stand under a lamppost in the cold December night.
	They are both frightened; MICHAEL gives ENZO a cigarette,
	lights it.  ENZO's hands are trembling, MICHAEL's are not.

				MICHAEL
		Get rid of those and look like
		you've got a gun in your pocket.

	The windows of the hospital twinkle with Christmas
	decorations.

				MICHAEL
		Listen...

	We HEAR the sound of a single automobile coming.  MICHAEL
	and ENZO look with fear in their eyes.  Then MICHAEL takes
	the bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket.
	They stand, hands in their pockets.

	A long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them.
	MICHAEL's and ENZO's faces are tough, impassive.  The car
	seems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerates.
	MICHAEL and ENZO are relieved.  MICHAEL looks down; the
	BAKER's hands are shaking.  He looks at his own, and they
	are not.

	Another moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound of
	police sirens.  They are clearly coming toward the hospital,
	getting louder and louder.  MICHAEL heaves a sigh of relief.

	In a second, a patrol car makes a screaming turn in front of
	the hospital; then two more squad cars follow with uniformed
	POLICE and DETECTIVES.  He smiles his relief and starts
	toward them.  TWO huge, burly POLICEMEN suddenly grab his
	arms while ANOTHER frisks him.  A massive POLICE CAPTAIN,
	spattered with gold braid and scrambled eggs on his hat,
	with beefy red face and white hair seems furious.  This is
	McCLUSKEY.

				MCCLUSKEY
		I thought I got all you guinea
		hoods locked up.  Who the hell are
		you and what are you doing here?

	ANOTHER COP standing nearby:

				COP
		He's clean, Captain.

	MICHAEL studies McCLUSKEY closely.

				MICHAEL
			  (quietly)
		What happened to the detectives who
		were supposed to be guarding my
		father?

				MCCLUSKEY
			  (furious)
		You punk-hood.  Who the hell are
		you to tell me my business.  I
		pulled them off.  I don't care how
		many Dago gangsters kill each other.
		I wouldn't lift a finger to keep
		your old man from getting knocked
		off.  Now get the hell out of here;
		get off this street you punk, and
		stay away from this hospital.

	MICHAEL stands quiet.

				MICHAEL
		I'll stay until you put guards
		around my father's room.

				MCCLUSKEY
		Phil, lock this punk up.

				A DETECTIVE
		The Kid's clean, Captain...He's a
		war hero, and he's never been mixed
		up in the rackets...

				MCCLUSKEY
			  (furious)
		Goddam it, I said lock him up.  Put
		the cuffs on him.

				MICHAEL
			  (deliberately, right
			  to McCLUSKEY's face,
			  as he's being handcuffed)
		How much is the Turk paying you to
		set my father up, Captain?

	Without any warning, McCLUSKEY leans back and hits MICHAEL
	squarely on the jaw with all his weight and strength.
	MICHAEL groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw.  He looks at
	McCLUSKEY; we are his VIEW and everything goes spinning, and
	he falls to the ground, just as we see HAGEN and CLEMENZA'S
	MEN arrive.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	EXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)

	HIGH ANGLE VIEW of THE CORLEONE MALL.  The gateway now has a
	long black car blocking it.  There are more BUTTON MEN
	stationed more formally; and some of them visibly carrying
	rifles; those of the houses close to the courtyard have MEN
	standing by open windows.  It is clear that the war is
	escalating.  A car pulls up and out get CLEMENZA, LAMPONE,
	MICHAEL and HAGEN.  MICHAEL's jaw is wired and bandaged.  He
	stops and looks up at the open window.  We can see MEN
	holding rifles.

				MICHAEL
		Christ, Sonny really means business.

	They continue walking.  TESSIO joins them.  The various
	BODYGUARDS make no acknowledgment.

				CLEMENZA
		How come all the new men?

				TESSIO
		We'll need them now.  After the
		hospital incident, Sonny got mad.
		We hit Bruno Tattaglia four o'clock
		this morning.

	INT DAY: DON'S HALLWAY

	They enter the house past the scores of new and strange faces.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	SONNY is in the DON's office; he is excited and exuberant.

				SONNY
		I've got a hundred button men on
		the streets twenty-four hours a day.
		If Sollozzo shows one hair on his
		ass he's dead.

	He sees MICHAEL, and holds his bandaged face in his hand,
	kiddingly.

				SONNY
		Mikey, you look beautiful!

				MICHAEL
		Cut it out.

				SONNY
		The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve
		of that son of a bitch!  After he
		craps out last night he wants a meet.

				HAGEN
		Was there a definite proposal?

				SONNY
		Sure, he wants us to send Mike to
		meet him to hear his proposition.
		The promise is the deal will be so
		good we can't refuse.

				HAGEN
		What about that Tattaglias?  What
		will they do about Bruno?

				SONNY
		Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out
		what they did to my father.

				HAGEN
		We should hear what they have to say.

				SONNY
		No, no Consiglere.  Not this time.
		No more meetings, no more
		discussions, no more Sollozzo
		tricks.  Give them one message: I
		WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all
		out war.  We go to the mattresses
		and we put all the button men out
		on the street.

				HAGEN
		The other families won't sit still
		for all out war.

				SONNY
		Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.

				HAGEN
		Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't
		want to hear this.  This is not a
		personal thing, this is Business.

				SONNY
		And when they shot me father...

				HAGEN
		Yes, even the shooting of your
		father was business, not personal...

				SONNY
		No no, no more advice on how to
		patch it up Tom.  You just help me
		win.  Understood?

	HAGEN bows his head; he is deeply concerned.

				HAGEN
		I found out about this Captain
		McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw.
		He's definitely on Sollozzo's
		payroll, and for big money.
		McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's
		bodyguard.  What you have to
		understand is that while Sollozzo
		is guarded like this, he's
		invulnerable.  Nobody has ever
		gunned down a New York Police
		Captain.  Never.  It would be
		disastrous.  All the five families
		would come after you Sonny; the
		Corleone family would be outcasts;
		even the old man's political
		protection would run for cover.  So
		just...take that into consideration.

				SONNY
			  (still fuming)
		McCluskey can't stay with the Turk
		forever.  We'll wait.

				MICHAEL
		We can't wait.  No matter what
		Sollozzo say about a deal, he's
		figuring out how to kill Pop.  You
		have to get Sollozzo now.

				SONNY
		The kid's right.

				HAGEN
		What about McCluskey?

				MICHAEL
		Let's say now that we have to kill
		McCluskey.  We'll clear that up
		through our Newspaper contacts later.

				SONNY
		Go on Mike.

				MICHAEL
		They want me to go to the conference
		with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting
		for two days from now.  Sonny, get
		our informers to find out where the
		meeting will be held.
		Insist it has to be a public place:
		a bar or restaurant at the height
		of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel
		safe.  They'll check me when I meet
		them so I won't be able to carry a
		weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a
		way to have one planted there for
		me.
			  (pause)
		Then I'll kill them both.

	Everyone in the room is astonished; they all look at MICHAEL.
	Silence.  SONNY suddenly breaks out in laughter.  He points
	a finger at MICHAEL, trying to speak.

				SONNY
		You?  You, the high-class college
		kid.  You never wanted to get mixed
		up in the family business.  Now you
		wanta gun down a police Captain and
		the Turk just because you got
		slapped in the face.  You're taking
		it personal, it's just business and
		he's taking it personal.

	Now CLEMENZA and TESSIO are also smiling; only HAGEN keeps
	his face serious.

				MICHAEL
			  (angrily, but cold)
		Sonny, it's all personal, and I
		learned it from him, the old man,
		the Godfather.  He took my joining
		the Marines personal.  I take
		Sollozzo trying to kill my father
		personal, and you know I'll kill
		them Sonny.

	MICHAEL radiates danger...SONNY stops laughing.

	INT DAY: CLEMENZA'S CELLAR (WINTER 1945)

	CLOSE on a revolver.

				CLEMENZA (O.S.)
		It's as cold as they come,
		impossible to trace.
			  (he turns it upside down)
		Don't worry about prints Mike, I
		put a special tape on the trigger
		and butt.  Here.
			  (he hands the gun to
			  another pair of hands)
		Whatsamatter?  Trigger too tight.
			  (it fires: very LOUD)
		I left it noisy, so it'll scare any
		pain-in-the-neck innocent bystander
		away.

	MICHAEL is alone with CLEMENZA in a cellar workshop.

				CLEMENZA
		Just let your hand drop to your
		side, and let the gun slip out.
		Everybody will still think you got
		it.  They'll be starin' at your
		face, see?  Then walk out of the
		place real fast, but don't run.
		Don't look anybody directly in the
		eye, but don't look away from them
		neither.  Hey, they'll be scared
		stiff o you, believe me.  Nobody's
		gonna bother with you.  Don't worry
		about nothing; you'd be surprised
		how good these things go.  O.K.,
		put your hat on, let's see how you
		look.  Helps with identification.

	They put the hat on; CLEMENZA adjusts it.

				CLEMENZA
		Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse
		to change their identification when
		we make them see the light.  Then
		you take a long vacation and we
		catch the hell.

				MICHAEL
		How bad will it be?

				CLEMENZA
		Probably all the other families
		will line up against us.  But, it's
		alright.  These things have to
		happen once every ten years or
		so...gets rid of the bad blood.
		You gotta stop 'em at the beginning.
		Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at
		Munich, they shoulda never let him
		get away with that, they were just
		asking for big trouble...

	INT DAY: DON'S HALL & LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL steps into the foyer of the main house.  A card
	table is set up with a man playing cards with three of the
	Corleone buttonmen.

	He continues into the living room.  It's a mess.  SONNY
	asleep on the sofa.  On the coffee table are the remains of
	a take-out Chinese food dinner, and a half-empty bottle of
	whisky.  The radio is playing.

				MICHAEL
		Why don't you stop living like a
		bum and get this place cleaned up.

				SONNY
		What are you, inspecting the
		barracks?
			  (SONNY sits up with
			  his head in his hands)
		You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you
		be sure to drop the gun right away?

				MICHAEL
		A million times.

				SONNY
		Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to
		pick you up in an hour and a half
		on Times Square, under the big
		Camels sign.

				HAGEN
		We don't let Mike go until we have
		the hostage, Sonny.

				CLEMENZA
		It's okay...the hostage is outside
		playing pinochle with three of my
		men.

	The phone rings in the DON's office.

				SONNY
		That could be a Tattaglia informer
		with the meeting place.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	HAGEN has hurried into the Den to get the phone; the OTHERS
	move in.

	HAGEN's on the phone; he writes something down.

				SONNY
		One of Tattaglia's people?

				HAGEN
		No.  Our informer in McCluskey's
		precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he
		signed out for Louis' Restaurant in
		the Bronx.  Anyone know it.

				TESSIO
		Sure, I do.  It's perfect for us.
		A small family place with big
		booths where people can talk in
		private.  Good food.  Everybody
		minds their business.  Perfect.
			  (he moves to the desk
			  and makes a crude drawing)
		This is the entrance, Mike.  When
		you finish just walk out and turn
		left, then turn the corner.
		Clemenza, you gotta work fast to
		plant the gun.  They got an old-
		fashioned toilet with a space
		between the water container and the
		wall.  We can tape the gun behind
		there.

				CLEMENZA
		Mike, they're gonna frisk you in
		the car.  You'll be clean so they
		won't worry 'bout nothing.  In the
		restaurant, wait and talk a while,
		and then ask permission to go.  See?
		Then when you come out, don't waste
		time; don't sit down...you come out
		blasting.  And don't take chances.
		In the head, two shots apiece.  And
		out as fast as your legs can move.

				SONNY
		I want somebody very good, very
		safe to plant that gun.  I don't
		want my brother coming out of that
		toilet with just his dick in his
		hand.

				CLEMENZA
		The gun will be there.

				SONNY
			  (to MICHAEL, warmly)
		You're on, kid...I'll square it
		with Mom your not seeing her before
		you left.  And I'll get a message
		to your girl friend when I think
		the time is right.

				CLEMENZA
		We gotta move...

				MICHAEL
		O.K.  How long do you think before
		I can come back?

				SONNY
		Probably a year...

				HAGEN
			  (starting to crack)
		Jesus, I don't know...

				SONNY
		Can you do it Mike?

	MICHAEL moves out.

	EXT NITE: CAMELS SIGN (WINTER 1945)

	The enormous "CAMELS" sign, puffing smoke, below it stands
	MICHAEL, dressed in a warm overcoat, and wearing the hat
	CLEMENZA had given him.  A long black car pulls around the
	corner and slows before him.  The DRIVER, leaning over, open
	the front door.

				DRIVER
		Get in, Mike.

	He does, the car drives off.

	EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)

	Inside the car, SOLLOZZO reaches his hand over the back seat
	and shakes MIKE's hand.

				SOLLOZZO
		I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we
		can straighten everything out.  All
		this is terrible, it's not the way
		I wanted things to happen at all.
		It should never have happened.

				MICHAEL
		I want to settle things tonight.  I
		want my father left alone.

				SOLLOZZO
		He won't be; I swear to you be my
		children he won't be.  Just keep an
		open mind when we talk.  I hope
		you're not a hothead like your
		brother, Sonny.  It's impossible to
		talk business with him.

	McCLUSKEY grunts.

				MCCLUSKEY
		He's a good kid.  He's all right.
		Turn around, up on your knees,
		facing me.

	He gives MICHAEL a thorough frisk.

				MCCLUSKEY
		I'm sorry about the other night
		Mike.  I'm getting too old for my
		job, too grouchy.  Can't stand the
		aggravation.  You know how it is.
		He's clean.

	EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR - WEST SIDE HIGHWAY (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL looks at the DRIVER and then ahead to see where
	they're heading.

	The car takes the George Washington Bridge.  MICHAEL is
	concerned.

				MICHAEL
		We're going to New Jersey?

				SOLLOZZO
			  (sly)
		Maybe.

	MICHAEL closes his eyes.

	EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR ON G.W. BRIDGE (WINTER 1945)

	The car speeds along the George Washington Bridge on its way
	to New Jersey.  Then suddenly it hits the divider,
	temporarily lifts into the air, and bounces over into the
	lanes going back to New York.  It then hits it very fast, on
	the way back to the city.

	EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)

	SOLLOZZO checks to see the cars that had been following, and
	then leans to the DRIVER.

				SOLLOZZO
		Nice work; I'll remember it.

	MICHAEL is relieved.

	EXT NITE: LUNA AZURA RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

	The car pulls up in front of a little family restaurant in
	the Bronx:  The "LUNA AZURA".  There is no one on the street.
	MICHAEL looks to see if the DRIVER is going to get out with
	them.  He gets out, and opens the door.  SOLLOZZO, McCLUSKEY
	and MICHAEL get out; the DRIVER remains leaning against the
	car.  They enter the restaurant.

	INT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)

	A very small family restaurant with a mosaic tile floor.
	SOLLOZZO, MICHAEL and McCLUSKEY sit around a rather small
	round table near the center of the room.  There are empty
	booths along the side walls; with a handful of CUSTOMERS,
	and ONE or TWO WAITERS.  It is very quiet.

				MCCLUSKEY
		Is the Italian food good here?

				SOLLOZZO
		Try the veal; it's the finest in
		New York.

	The solitary WAITER brings a bottle of wine to the table.
	They watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three
	glasses.  Then, when he leaves, SOLLOZZO turns to McCLUSKEY:

				SOLLOZZO
		I am going to talk Italian to Mike.

				MCCLUSKEY
		Sure, you two go right ahead; I'll
		concentrate on my veal and my
		spaghetti.

	SOLLOZZO now begins in rapid Sicilian.  MICHAEL listening
	carefully and nodding every so often.  Then MICHAEL answers
	in Sicilian, and SOLLOZZO goes on.  The WAITER occasionally
	brings food; and they hesitate while he is there; then go on.
	Then MICHAEL, having difficulty expressing himself in
	Italian, accidentally lapses into English.

				MICHAEL
			  (using English for emphasis)
		Most important...I want a sure
		guarantee that no more attempts
		will be made on my father's life.

				SOLLOZZO
		What guarantees can I give you?  I
		am the hunted one.  I've missed my
		chance.  You think too highly of
		me, my friend...I am not so
		clever...all I want if a truce...

	MICHAEL looks long and hard at SOLLOZZO, who is smiling
	holding his open hands up as if to say: "I have no tricks up
	my sleeve".  Then he looks away and makes a distressed look
	on his face.

				SOLLOZZO
		What is it?

				MICHAEL
		Is it all right if I go to the
		bathroom?

	SOLLOZZO is intuitively suspicious.  He studies MICHAEL with
	his dark eyes.  Then he thrusts his hand onto MICHAEL's
	thigh feeling in and around, searching for a weapon.

				MCCLUSKEY
		I frisked him; I've frisked
		thousands of young punks; he's clean.

	He looks at a MAN sitting at a table opposite them;
	indicating the bathroom with his eyes.  The MAN nods,
	indicating no one is there.

				SOLLOZZO
		Don't take too long.

	MICHAEL gets up and calmly walks to the bathroom, and
	disappears inside.

	INT NITE: LUNA AZURA TOILET (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL steps into the small bathroom; he is breathing very
	hard.  He actually uses the urinal.  Then he washes his
	hands with the bar of pink soap; and dries them thoroughly.
	Then he moves to the booth, up to the old-fashioned toilet.
	Slowly he reaches behind the water tank; he panics when he
	cannot feel the gun.  We see behind the tank his hand is
	just a few inches from the gun...he gropes
	searchingly...finally coming to rest on the gun.

	CLOSE ON MICHAEL; the feel of it reassures him.  Then he
	breaks it loose from the tape holding it; he takes a deep
	breath and shoves it under his waistband.  For some
	unexplainable reason he hesitates once again, deliberately
	washes his hands and dries them.  Then he goes out.

	INT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)

	He hesitates by the bathroom door; and looks at his table.
	McCLUSKEY is eating a plate of spaghetti and veal.  SOLLOZZO
	turns around upon hearing the door, and looks directly at
	MICHAEL.  MICHAEL looks back.  Then he smiles and continues
	back to the table.  He sits down.

				MICHAEL
		Now I can talk.  I feel much better.

	The MAN by the far wall had been stiff with attention; now
	he too relaxes.  SOLLOZZO leans toward MICHAEL who sits down
	comfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutton
	his jacket.  SOLLOZZO begins to speak in Sicilian once again
	but MICHAEL's heart is pounding so hard he can barely hear
	him.

	The WAITER comes to ask about the order, SOLLOZZO turns to
	speak, and without warning, MICHAEL shoves the table away
	from him with his left hand, and with his right hand puts
	the gun right against SOLLOZZO's head, just touching his
	temple.  He pulls the trigger, and we see part of SOLLOZZO's
	head blown away, and a spray of fine mist of blood cover the
	entire area.

	The WAITER looks in amazement; suddenly his white jacket is
	sprayed and stained with blood.

	SOLLOZZO seems in a perpetual fall to the floor; through he
	seems to hang in space suspended.

	MICHAEL pivots, and looks:

	There is McCLUSKEY, frozen, the fork with a piece of veal
	suspended in air before his gaping mouth.

	MICHAEL fires; catching McCLUSKEY in his thick bulging
	throat.  He makes a horrible, gagging, choking sound.  Then
	coolly, and deliberately, MICHAEL fires again, fires right
	through McCLUSKEY's white-topped skull.

	The air is filled with pink mist.
	MICHAEL swings toward the MAN standing by the bathroom wall.
	He does not make a move, seemingly paralyzed.
	Now he carefully shows his hands to be empty.
	The WAITER steps backward through the mist of blood, an
	expression of horror on his face.
	MICHAEL looks at his two victims:
	SOLLOZZO still in his chair, side of his body propped up by
	the table.
	McCLUSKEY finally falls from the chair to the table.
	MICHAEL is wildly at a peak.  He starts to move out.  His
	hand: is frozen by his side, STILL GRIPPING THE GUN.
	He moves, not letting the gun go.

	MICHAEL's face; frozen in its expression.

	His hand: still holding the gun.

	His face: finally he closes his eyes.

	His hand relaxes, the gun falls to the floor with a dull thud.

	He walks quickly out of the restaurant, looks back.

	He sees a frozen tableau of the murder; as though it had
	been recreated in wax.

	Then he leaves.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	INT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN is his shirtsleeves plays a sentimental tune on an old
	upright piano, while his cigarette burns on the edge.
	ANOTHER stands nearby, listening quietly.

	A little distance away, TEN MEN sit around a crude table,
	quietly eating.  They talk in low, relaxed voices, and there
	is an occasional laugh.

	ROCCO LAMPONE stands by a window, which has been covered
	with a heavy-mesh wire grating, gazing out.

	A large bowl of pasta is passed, and the MEN eat heartily.

	The sentimental tune is continued over the following:

	INT DAY: BODIES IN CAR (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN and a WOMAN, blood coming out of their noses, lie
	still together in a bullet-riddled automobile.

	INT DAY: BODY IN BARBER SHOP (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN is covered by a sheet on the floor of a barber shop.

	INT DAY: MATTRESS

	Ten mattresses are spread out around the otherwise empty
	living room of an apartment.  THREE or FOUR MEN including
	CLEMENZA, are taking naps.

	An arsenal of hand guns are spread out on a card table.

	The MEN at the table continue their dinner; passing and
	pouring the wine.

	Trash is thrown in 2 or 3 garbage cans kept in the apartment.

	INT DAY: BODY IN OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN, his clothes soaked in blood, lies on the floor of an
	office building, dead, under an enormous portrait of Harry S.
	Truman.

	EXT DAY: BODY ON STOOP (WINTER 1945)

	ANOTHER MAN, his trousers soaked in blood, lies spanning
	three steps of a front stoop.

	INT NITE: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

	TESSIO, sits in a simple straight-backed chair, doing a
	crossword puzzle.

	A thin, boyish BUTTON MAN, writes a letter.

	Six or seven empty mattresses, with tossed unmade blankets.
	Coffee cans beside them serve as ash trays.

	A MAN by the table pulls the cork on another bottle of
	Ruffino, and wine is poured as the MEN eat.

	EXT DAY: BODY IN ALLEY (WINTER 1945)

	A CORPSE is half out of an overturned garbage can in a quiet
	alley.

	INT DAY: BODY AT TABLE (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN in a formal jacket and tie is slumped over a table, in
	a pool of blood on the tablecloth.

	INT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

	A neatly stacked pile of newspapers in the corner of an
	apartment.  We catch a glimpse of one headline: "Five Family
	War..."

	The table.  The MEN are sitting around cracking nuts.  ONE
	has fallen asleep on his arms at the table.

	SEVERAL MEN are taking naps on the Mattresses.

	The PIANO PLAYER finishes the tune with finesse.  Picks up
	and takes a drag from his cigarette.  The OTHER MAN nods
	appreciatively.

				MAN
		Nice Augie...nice.

	EXT DAY: MANCINI BLDG. (SPRING '46)

	Several cars are parked in front of a pleasant New York
	apartment building.  We recognize a couple of SONNY's
	bodyguards loafing by the cars, pitching playing cards
	against the curb.

	Inside the building, two others wait quietly by the rows of
	brass mailboxes: they have been there quite awhile.

	Up one flight of stairs, a single man sits on the step,
	smoking a cigarette.

	One of the men by the mailboxes checks his pocketwatch,
	which is attached to a key chain.  We HEAR the sound of a
	door opening; they look up.

	The man sitting on the stop stands; and looks.

	SONNY backs out of an apartment, the arms of LUCY MANCINI
	wrapped around him.  She doesn't want to let go of him; she
	draws him back into the apartment for a moment, and then he
	comes out alone, adjusting his clothes.

	He jauntily skips down the steps, trailed by the bodyguard
	on the first floor, and moves outside toward his car.  The
	men quickly take up their positions.  As he gets in his car:

				DRIVER
		Pick up your sister?

				SONNY
		Yeah.

	The car drives off; accompanied and escorted by the
	bodyguards in their cars.

	INT DAY: CONNIE'S HALL (SPRING '46)

	He knocks on the door.  No answer.  Then again.

				CONNIE'S VOICE
		Who is it?

				SONNY
		It's me, Sonny.

	We hear the bolt slide back, and see the door open.  SONNY
	enters, but CONNIE has quickly moved into the hallway, her
	back to him.

				SONNY
			  (tenderly)
		Connie, what is it?

	He turns her around in his arms.

	Her face is swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her
	rough, red eyes that she has been crying for a long time.
	As soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red
	with rage.  She sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing
	him from running out of the apartment.

				CONNIE
			  (desperately)
		It was my fault!  I started a fight
		with him and I tried to hit him so
		he hit me.  He didn't even try to
		hit me hard Sonny, I walked into it.

	Sonny listens, and calms himself.  He touches her shoulder,
	the thin silk robe.

				SONNY
		I'm goin' to have the doctor come
		over and take a look at you.

	He starts to leave.

				CONNIE
		Oh Sonny, please don't do anything.
		Please don't.

	He stops, and then laughs good naturedly.

				SONNY
		Hey.  Con.  What'm I goin' to do?
		Make your kid a orphan before he's
		born.

	She laughs with him.  He kisses her reassuringly, and leaves.

	EXT DAY: CONNIE'S STREET

	CARLO settles down on the front steps of the 112th St.
	"Book" with SALLY RAGS and COACH, who have been drinking
	beer out of glasses and a pitcher of beer from around the
	corner.  The ball game is blaring from the radio; and the
	kids on the street are still playing stickball.

	CARLO has barely settled down, when the kids in the street
	suddenly scatter, and a car comes screeching up the block
	and to a halt in front of the candy store.  The tires
	scream, and before it seems as though it has even stopped, a
	MAN comes hurtling out of the driver's seat, moving so fast
	the everyone is paralyzed.  It is a moment before we
	recognize that it is SONNY.

	His face is contorted with anger; in a split second he is on
	the stoop and has CARLO by the throat.

	He pulls CARLO away from the others, trying to get him down
	into the street.  But CARLO reaches out for the iron railing,
	and hangs on, his hand in a lock, cringing away, trying to
	hide his head and face in the hollow of the his shoulders.
	His shirt is ripped away in SONNY's hand.

	SALLY RAGS and COACH, merely sit, watching, stunned.

	SONNY is pounding the cowered CARLO with all his strength,
	in a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing.  His
	blows are powerful; and begin to draw blood.

	The kids who have been playing stickball, move up, watching
	in fascination.

	CARLO's hands are clenched tight around the railing.

	SONNY beats him mercilessly.

	Now SONNY's bodyguards' car pulls up, and they too become
	spectators.

	SONNY's tight fists are going down like hammers, into
	CARLO's face and body.

	CARLO's nose is bleeding profusely; but still he does
	nothing, other than hang onto the railing.

	SONNY grabs hold of CARLO's massive body, and tries to drag
	him off of the hold on the railing, his teeth clenched in
	the effort.  Then he tries loosening CARLO's locked hands;
	even biting them.  CARLO screams but he does not let go.

	It's clear that CARLO is much stronger than he is, and will
	not be moved.  SONNY knees him in the mouth, and beats him
	more; but he is exhausted.  Totally out of breath, he
	stammers haltingly to the bleeding CARLO.

				SONNY
		You...bastard...You...hurt my
		sister... again...and I'll
		kill...you.

	He wipes the sweat from his face, and then turns suddenly.
	and hurries back to the car, in a moment his car is gone,
	leaving even his bodyguards in confusion.  We notice ONE MAN
	with a sports jacket in the group of spectators especially
	interested.

	CARLO finally relaxes the clenched, locked hands.  He slumps
	onto the stoop.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

	HIGH ANGLE on the Corleone Mall.  It is a gray, rainy day.
	Young BUTTON MEN in raincoats stand in quiet groups of
	various points around the main house and compound.  Things
	have changed; one house has been extensively enlarged; a new
	and secure gate house has been built.  Security measures
	that had been make-shift and temporarily have now been made
	a permanent part of the Mall, evolving it into a Medieval
	Fortress.  We notice a huge crater in the courtyard; the
	result of a recent bomb attempt.  The house nearest the
	crater is damaged by fire.

	A taxi arrives; KAY ADAMS steps out, huddled in a bright
	yellow raincoat; she lets the cab go, and hurries to the
	shelter of the gate house.

	They are not expecting her, and ask her to wait while they
	call the main house.

	KAY looks at the imposing, depressing Mall, while rain still
	runs down onto her face.

	She notices the bomb crater, and the fire damage; and the
	sullen faces of the BUTTON MEN.

	TOM HAGEN exits the Main House, and hurries toward her.

				HAGEN
		Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You
		should call...

				KAY
		I've tried calling and writing.  I
		want to reach Michael.

				HAGEN
		Nobody knows where he is.  We know
		he's all right, but that's all.

	KAY looks in the direction of the crater, filling with
	rainwater.

				KAY
		What was that?

				HAGEN
		An accident.  No one was hurt.

				KAY
		Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I
		come in to call another one?

	TOM is clearly reluctant to involve her any more than he has
	to.

				HAGEN
		Sure...I'm sorry.

	They hurry through the rain and into the Main House.

	INT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	In the living room, KAY shakes the water from her coat and
	takes her rainhat off.

				KAY
		Will you give this to him.

				HAGEN
		If I accept that letter and you
		told a Court of Law I accepted it,
		they would interpret it as my
		having knowledge of his whereabouts.
		Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.

	We hear footsteps descending the staircase; MAMA CORLEONE
	enters the room; the OLD WOMAN squints at KAY, evaluating her.

				MAMA
		You're Mikey's little girl.

	KAY nods yes; there are still tears in her eyes.

				MAMA
		You eat anything?

	KAY shakes her head.

				MAMA
			  (to HAGEN)
		Disgrazia, you don't even give the
		poor girl a cup of coffee?

	HAGEN shrugs helplessly; on an impulse, KAY quickly moves
	toward MAMA, the letter extended.

				KAY
		Will you give this letter to Michael.

				HAGEN
		Mama, no.

				MAMA
		You tell me what to do?  Even he
		don't tell me what to do.

	She takes the letter from KAY, who is grateful and relieved.

				KAY
		Why did they blame Michael?

				MAMA
		You listen to me, you go home to
		your family, and you find a good
		young man and get married.  Forget
		about Mikey; he's no good for you,
		anymore.

	She looks directly into KAY's eyes; and KAY understands what
	that means.

	EXT DAY: DON'S HOSPITAL (SPRING 1946)

	A hospital in New York City.  POLICE and teams of PRIVATE
	DETECTIVES are stationed guarding the area.  An ambulance
	with a team of DETECTIVES and BUTTON-MEN GUARDS exit the
	hospital with rifles in hand; followed by SEVERAL HOSPITAL
	ASSISTANTS wheeling a hospital stretcher, presumably carrying
	the DON.

	TESSIO and CLEMENZA emerge, with OTHER BUTTON MEN bringing
	up the rear.  HAGEN walks with the stretcher, and for a
	moment they disappear behind the ambulance.  Then suddenly,
	siren blasting, it speeds off, accompanied by dark low-slung
	cars.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

	The Corleone Mall.

	Equally impressive security stands ready at the Corleone
	Mall.  EXTRA BUTTON MEN, as well as SOME POLICE, and PRIVATE
	DETECTIVES.

	It all seems to be under the supervision of ROCCO LAMPONE.
	All is silent.  The WOMEN and CHILDREN, dressed in Sunday
	clothes, wait.

	EXT DAY: AMBULANCE (SPRING 1946)

	One ambulance, speeding along the Grand Central Parkway,
	preceded and followed by a dark car, each one carrying a
	team of BUTTON MEN.

	Sitting next to the DRIVER of the ambulance is a GUARD with
	a rifle on his lap.

	INT DAY: DON'S HALL (SPRING 1946)

	Inside the Main CORLEONE House:

	Hospital ORDERLIES carry the DON on his stretcher carefully
	under the watchful eyes of CLEMENZA, TESSIO, LAMPONE and
	various GUARDS and BUTTON MEN.

	All the CORLEONE family is here today: MAMA, FREDO, SANDRA,
	THERESA, CONNIE, CARLO; the various CORLEONE CHILDREN.

	INT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The DON is made comfortable in his room, which has all but
	been converted into a hospital room, with complete and
	extensive equipment.  The various CHILDREN get a turn to
	kiss the OLD MAN, as he is made comfortable... and then
	SONNY indicates that all the CHILDREN, WOMEN, and CARLO
	should leave.

	They do, the door is closed.

	INT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The mood is quite happy downstairs, as the WOMEN prepare the
	Sunday dinner, and set the table.

	CARLO sits alone among them, a frown on his face.

				CONNIE
		What's the matter, Carlo?

				CARLO
		Shut up.

	INT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

	All the MEN of the family stand around the hospital bed with
	grim faces, SONNY and HAGEN closest to the OLD MAN.  The DON
	does not speak, yet he asks questions with his looks and
	glances, as clearly as if they were verbalized.  HAGEN is
	the spokesman for the family.

				HAGEN
		...since McCluskey's killing, the
		police have cracked down on most of
		our operations...on the other
		families too.  There's been a lot
		of bad blood.

	The OLD MAN glances at SONNY.

				SONNY
		Pop, they hit us and we hit them
		back.

				HAGEN
		We put out a lot of material
		through our contacts in the
		Newspapers...about McCluskey's
		being tied up with Sollozzo in the
		Drug Rackets...things are starting
		to loosen up.

	The OLD MAN nods.

				SONNY
		Freddie's gonna go to Las
		Vegas...under the protection of Don
		Francesco of L.A.  I want him to
		rest...

				FREDO
		I'm goin' to learn the casino
		business.

	The DON nods approvingly.  Then he searches around the room
	for a face he does not see.  HAGEN knows who he's looking for.

				HAGEN
		Michael...
			  (he takes a breath)
		It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

	The DON closes his eyes, and then reopens them in anger and
	rage.

				HAGEN
		He's safe now...we're already
		working on ways to bring him back.

	The DON is very angry, he motions with a weak hand that they
	leave him alone.

	INT. DAY: DON'S STAIRS AND HALL (SPRING 1946)

	HAGEN is very upset as he comes down the Stairs; SONNY is
	expansive and optimistic.

				SONNY
		We'll let the old man take it easy
		for a couple of weeks.  I want to
		get things going good before he
		gets better.  What's the matter
		with you?

				HAGEN
		You start operating, the five
		families will start their raids
		again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny,
		your war is costing us a lot of
		money.

				SONNY
		No more stalemate Tom, we got the
		soldiers, we'll match them gun for
		gun if that's how they want it.
		They know me for what I am, Tom--
		and they're scared of me.

				HAGEN
		Yes.  That's true, you're getting a
		hell of a reputation.

				SONNY
		Well it's war!  We might not be in
		this shape if we had a real war-
		time Consiglere, a Sicilian.  Pop
		had Genco, who do I have?
			  (TOM starts to leave)
		Hey Tom, hey...hey.  It's Sunday,
		we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be
		sore.

	INT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The FAMILY, WIVES, CHILDREN and all sit around the table
	over Sunday dinner.  SONNY is at the head of the table.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

	SOME of the CORLEONE GRANDCHILDREN play in the enclosed
	Mall, in the proximity of the BUTTON MEN stationed liberally
	by the gate.

	ONE CHILD misses a ball, it rolls by the gate house.  A
	young BUTTON MAN scoops it up and throws it back, smiling.

	-----------------------------------------FADE OUT-------

	INT DAY: CONNIE'S APT. (SPRING 1946)

	CONNIE and CARLO's apartment.  She's in a slip, on the phone.
	We HEAR the shower going in the bathroom.

				CONNIE
		Who is this?

				GIRL (O.S.)
			  (giggle)
		I'm a friend of Carlo's.  I just
		wanted to tell him I can't see him
		tonight; I have to go out of town.

	CONNIE's face turns red.

				CONNIE
		You lousy tramp bitch.
			  (click)


	She slams the phone down; just as CARLO is coming out of the
	bathroom drying his golden body.

				CARLO
		What was that?

				CONNIE
		Your girl friend.  She says she
		can't make it tonight.  You lousy
		bastard you have the nerve to give
		your whores my telephone number.
		I'll kill you, you bastard!

	She hauls off and punches him knowingly; he laughs, so then
	she flings herself at him, kicking and scratching; her heavy
	belly heaving under the thin slip.

				CARLO
			  (defending himself)
		You're crazy.  She was kidding
		around; I don't know, some nut.

	He pushes her aside, and moves into the bedroom to continue
	dressing.

				CONNIE
		You're staying home.  You're not
		going out.

				CARLO
		OK, OK.  You gonna make me something
		to eat at least?

	That calms her down; she stands there a moment, breathing
	heavily; and then she nods, and goes into the kitchen, and
	starts her wifely duties.

	CARLO is dressed; puts on some cologne; CONNIE appears in
	the doorway.

				CONNIE
		The food is on the table.

				CARLO
		I'm not hungry yet.

				CONNIE
		Eat it, it's on the table.

				CARLO
		Ba Fa Goulle.

				CONNIE
		BA FA GOULE YOU!

	She turns deliberately, goes out into the kitchen.  A moment
	later we begin to hear the sound of dishes breaking.  CARLO
	slowly walks out, where we can see CONNIE systematically
	smashing all the dishes against the sink, sending the greasy
	veal and peppers all over the apartment floor.

				CARLO
		You filthy guinea spoiled brat.
		Clean it up or I'll kick your head
		in.

				CONNIE
		Like hell I will.

	She stands there, solid, ready to punch him again.  Slowly,
	he slides his belt out of his trousers, and doubles it in
	his hand.

				CARLO
		Clean it up!

	He swings the belt against her heavy hips.  She moves back
	into the kitchen, and gets a kitchen knife, and holds it
	ready.

				CARLO
		Even the female Corleones are
		murderers.

	He puts the strap down on a table, and moves after her.  She
	makes a sudden thrust at his groin, which he avoids.  He
	pulls the knife away, cutting his hand in the process.  She
	gets away momentarily, but he pursues her around the table,
	gets her; and starts to slap her in the face.

	She breaks away from him, and rushes into the bedroom.

				CONNIE
		The baby!  The baby!

	INT DAY: CONNIE'S BEDROOM  (SPRING 1946)

	She runs into the bedroom; he follows.  She moves into a
	corner, and then like a desperate animal, tries to hide
	under the bed.

	He reaches under, and pulls her out by the hair.

	He slaps her in the face until she begins to weep; then he
	throws her on the bed, contemptuously.  He grabs part of her
	thigh, pinching it very hard.

				CARLO
		You're fat as a pig.

	Then he pushes her away, and walks out of the room, leaving
	her in tears.  She is crying; she pulls herself to the
	bedroom phone, and in a whisper:

				CONNIE
		Mama...mama, it's Connie.  Mama, I
		can't talk any louder.  No, I don't
		want to talk to Sonny.

	We can tell that the phone has been passed to SONNY.

	INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (SPRING 1946)

	In the kitchen at the Mall, MAMA cannot understand the
	whispering and she has given the phone to SONNY.

				SONNY
		Yeah Connie.

				CONNIE (O.S.)
		Sonny, just send a car to bring me
		home.  I'll tell you then, it's
		nothing Sonny, don't you come.
		Send TOM, please Sonny, it's
		nothing; I just want to come home.

	SONNY's face is turning red.

				SONNY
			  (in a controlled voice)
		You wait there.  You just wait there.

	He hangs up the phone; and just stands there for a moment.

				SONNY
			  (quietly)
		That sonofabitch; that sonofabitch...

	HAGEN enters the room; he knows what is happening, knows he
	cannot interfere.

	EXT DAY: MALL

	SONNY leaves the house.  HAGEN moves to the outside mall
	just as SONNY's car is driving off.  He moves to a group of
	BUTTON MEN.

				HAGEN
		Go after him.

	EXT DAY: CAUSEWAY (SPRING 1946)

	SONNY's car on the Jones Beach Causeway, speeds quickly by.
	After a pause, another car, with the CORLEONE BODYGUARDS, is
	trailing.

	SONNY is driving; he is very angry.

	EXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)

	SONNY in his car; driving back.  Still breathing hard and
	still furious.  Then he thinks it's funny; he enjoyed it.
	He starts laughing, louder and louder, as he pulls up to a
	toll booth, stops, and extends his hand with a coin to the
	COLLECTOR.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	INT NITE: AMERIGO BONASERA'S APARTMENT

	The serious-faced UNDERTAKER is on the telephone.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		This is Tom Hagen.  I'm calling for
		Don Corleone, at his request.

	BONASERA looks at his WIFE, with deep anxiety in his eyes.
	BONASERA's lips are suddenly dry.

				BONASERA
		Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		You owe the Don a service.  In one
		hour, not before, perhaps later, he
		will be at your funeral parlor to
		ask for your help.  Be there to
		greet him.  If you have any
		objections speak now, and I'll
		inform him.

	Silence.  BONASERA stutters, then speaks in fright.

				BONASERA
		Anything...Anything the Godfather
		wishes.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		Good.  He never doubted you.

				BONASERA
		The Don himself is coming to me
		tonight?

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		Yes.
			  (click)


	BONASERA is sweating; slowly he lowers the phone; his WIFE
	sees his pale expression, and follows him into the room.

	Silently, he begins the ritual of dressing.  His WIFE knows
	something serious is happening, and never takes her eyes
	from him.  He lights a cigarette.

				BONASERA
		For the last year, they have been
		killing one another.  So now, what?
		Your Godfather comes to me...Why?
			  (whispering, slyly)
		They've killed someone so important
		that they wish to make his body
		disappear.

				MRS. BONASERA
			  (frightened)
		Amerigo!

				BONASERA
		They could make me an accomplice to
		their murder.  They could send me
		to jail!

	He slips into his trousers.  Then he moves to his WIFE to
	tie his tie, as she has done for years.

				BONASERA
		And if the other families find
		out...they will make me their enemy.
		They could come here to our house.
		I curse the day I ever went to the
		Godfather.

	EXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)

	With his ring of keys, he opens the funeral parlor, enters.

	INT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)

	BONASERA walks through the darkened funeral parlor, without
	turning on the lights; then into the rear, preparation room,
	past the tables, and equipment.  He operates the chain that
	lifts a large overhead garage type door.  And looks out into
	the alley.

	He sits on a bench, and waits.

	EXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR ALLEY (SPRING 1946)

	The tires of a car roll very quietly along the small alley;
	we notice a dark car approach the rear of BONASERA's funeral
	parlor.

	CLEMENZA gets out, and moves to the open, rear door.
	BONASERA greets him, too petrified to speak.  He notices TWO
	OTHER MEN get out of the car, and carry a stretcher with a
	CORPSE swaddled in a gray blanket, with yellowed feet
	protruding.

	BONASERA closes his eyes in fear, but indicates which way
	the MEN should carry their sinister burden.

	INT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR EMBALMING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	They carry the CORPSE to one of the tables in the embalming
	room.

	Then BONASERA turns to see ANOTHER MAN step out of the
	darkness somewhat uncertainly.  It is DON CORLEONE.

	He walks up to BONASERA, very close, without speaking.  His
	cold eyes looking directly at the frightened UNDERTAKER.
	Then, after a long gaze:

				DON CORLEONE
		Well my friend, are you ready to do
		me this service?

	BONASERA nods.  The DON moves to the CORPSE on the embalming
	table; he makes a gesture, and the OTHER MEN leave them alone.

				BONASERA
		What do you wish me to do?

				DON CORLEONE
			  (staring at the table)
		I want you to use all your powers,
		all your skill, as you love me.  I
		do not want his mother to see him
		as he is.

	He draws down the gray blanket.

	BONASERA lets out a gasp of horror at what he sees:

	The bullet-smashed face of SONNY CORLEONE.

	EXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)

	SONNY extends his hand with a coin at the toll booth.

	A car suddenly swerves in front of him, trapping him in the
	booth, and in incredible rally of machine gun fire greets
	him, coming through and smashing the windows of the toll
	booths on both side of him, and from the front window of the
	car blocking him.

	The windows of his car are shot out.

	Bullet holes puncture the doors of his car.

	His hand, with the coin in it, falls inside the car.

	His arms, shoulders are riddled by the fire, and still it
	continues, as though the ASSASSINS cannot take a chance that
	he will survive it.

	Suddenly, he lets out an enormous ROAR, like a bull, and
	actually, opens the door, and steps out of the car, UNDER
	fire.

	His face is hit; and finally he falls to the ground.

	A FULL SHOT...as the ASSASSINS scramble for their cars and
	make off in the distance.

	SONNY's BODYGUARDS stop a safe distance away, realizing they
	are too late.

	INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	View on HAGEN's ashen face in the living room.  He is silent
	a moment, and then:

				HAGEN
			  (quietly)
		OK.  Go to Clemenza's house and
		tell him to come here right away.
		He'll tell you what to do.

	The MEN leave him alone.  He is quiet, standing in the
	middle of the living room a moment.  He looks in the
	direction of the kitchen, where he can see fragments of MAMA
	moving around.

	INT NITE: UPSTAIRS (SPRING 1946)

	TOM proceeds up stairs, and quietly in the direction of the
	DON's room.  He opens the DON's door.  Looks in.

	INT NITE: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The DON in his hospital bed.  Asleep under sedation.  HAGEN
	hesitates.  He cannot go in; he cannot tell the OLD MAN.  He
	closes the door.

	INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (SPRING 1946)

	HAGEN alone in the office.  He is drinking.  He looks up at
	the sound of cars; the CAPOREGIMES are arriving.  Then he
	hears footsteps.

	The door opens; and in a robe, with slippers, DON CORLEONE
	slowly enters the room.  He walks directly to his stuffed
	armchair, sits down.  His face is stern, as he looks into
	HAGEN's eyes.

				DON CORLEONE
		Give me a drop of anisette.

	HAGEN rises, and pours a glass for the OLD MAN.

				DON CORLEONE
		My wife was weeping before she fell
		asleep, outside my window I saw my
		caporegimes to the house, and it is
		midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine,
		I think you should tell your Don
		what everyone knows.

				HAGEN
			  (quietly)
		I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was
		about to come up and wake you and
		tell you.  Just now.

				DON CORLEONE
		But you needed a drink first.

				HAGEN
		Yes.

				DON CORLEONE
		Now you've had your drink.

	Pause.

				HAGEN
		They shot Sonny on the Causeway.
			  (pause)
		He's dead.

	DON CORLEONE blinks.  One feels that just for a second he
	loses all physical strength; he clasps his hands in front of
	him on the top of the desk and looks into HAGEN's eyes.

				DON CORLEONE
		I want no inquiries made.  No acts
		of vengeance.
			  (pause)
		Consigliere, arrange a meeting with
		the heads of the five
		families...this war stops now.

	He rises and unsteadily leaves the room, turns...

				DON CORLEONE
		Call Bonasera...he will do me a
		service.

	And leaves.  HAGEN moves to the phone; dials...

				HAGEN
		This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for
		Don Corleone, at his request.

				BONASERA (O.S.)
		Yes, I understand I'm listening.

				HAGEN
		You owe the Don a service.  He has
		no doubt that you will repay it.

	EXT DAY: BANK BUILDING (SPRING 1946)

	Day in Manhattan.  An impressive Bank Building in the
	financial center of New York.  Many limousines are parked,
	uniforms and plain-clothed CHAUFFEURS waiting quietly.

	INT DAY: BOARD ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The Board Room of a bank, daylight shines in the windows.

	CARLO TRAMONTI, an impressive, handsome middle-aged man,
	sits quietly, smoking a Di Napoli cigar, OUR VIEW moves to a
	MAN sitting to his left, and a little to the rear, and
	settles on JOSEPH ZALUCHI, a moon-faced amiable-looking man;
	as the view continues, around the table, we HEAR:

				DON CORLEONE (O.S.)
		I want to thank you all for coming.
		I consider it a service done to me
		personally and I am in the debt of
		each and every one of you.
		Especially those of you who have
		traveled from such distances as
		California, St. Louis, Kansas City;
		and New Orleans...

	The VIEW PASSES to FRANK FALCONE and ANTHONY MOLINARI, both
	younger than any of the others; then on to DOMENICK PANZA,
	short and squat sitting in a wheelchair; then around the
	table to DON VINCENENZO FORLENZA, who is whispering to his
	JEWISH ASSISTANT; the VIEW PASSES on to ANTHONY STRACCI, an
	older man, sipping from a drink and smoking a cigar; OTTILIO
	CUNEO, in his middle sixties with a jolly round face; then
	DON PHILLIP TATTAGLIA, a delicate older man with dyed hair
	and a pencil mustache; and finally, EMILIO BARZINI, in his
	early sixties, a man to 'respect'; whom we had seen at
	CONNIE's Wedding.

				DON CORLEONE
		Ah well, let's get down to business.
		We are all honorable men here, we
		don't have to give assurances as if
		we were lawyers.
			  (he sits, gazes out
			  at them, and sighs)
		How did things ever go so far?
		Well, no matter.  A lot of
		foolishness has come to pass.  It
		was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

	The VIEW examines the room once again, as the DON speaks.  A
	large, clicking board is changing numbers at various times,
	and two tapes, showing the fluctuations of the Market during
	the day's trading, and projected above.

	DON CORLEONE pauses; and TOM HAGEN hands him a cold drink.

				DON CORLEONE
		Tattaglia has lost a son; I have
		lost a son.  We are quits.  Let
		there be a peace...
			  (he gestures
			  expressively,
			  submissively, with
			  his hands)
		That is all I want...

				BARZINI
		Don Corleone is too modest.  He had
		the judges and politicians in his
		pocket and he refused to share them.
		His refusal is not the act of a
		friend.  He takes the bread out of
		the mouths of our families.  Times
		have changed, it's not like the old
		days where everyone can go his own
		way.  If Don Corleone had all the
		judges and politicians in New York,
		then he must share them or let
		others use them.  Certainly he can
		present a bill for such services,
		we're not Communists, after all.
		But he has to let us draw water
		from the well.  It's that simple.

				DON CORLEONE
		My friends, I didn't refuse out of
		malice.  You all know me.  When
		have I ever refused an accommodation?
		But why, this time?  Because I
		think this drug business will
		destroy us in the years to come.
		It's not like whiskey or gambling
		or even women which most people
		want and is forbidden them by the
		pezzonovante of the Church and the
		Government.  But drugs?  No.  Even
		policemen, who help us in gambling
		and other things would refuse to
		help us in drugs.  But...I am
		willing to do whatever all of you
		think is necessary.

				DON ZALUCHI
		I don't believe in drugs.  For
		years I paid my people extra so
		they wouldn't do that kind of
		business...$200 a week.  But it
		didn't matter.  Somebody comes to
		them and says, "I have powders, if
		you put up three, four thousand
		dollar investment, we can make
		fifty thousand distributing."  Who
		can resist such a profit?
		There's no way to control it, as a
		business...to keep it respectable.
			  (rapping the table)
		I don't want it near schools!  I
		don't want it sold to children.
		That is an infamita.
			  (thinking)
		In my city I would try to keep the
		traffic in the dark people, the
		colored.  They are the best
		customers, the least troublesome,
		and they are animals anyway.  They
		have no respect for their wives or
		their families or themselves.  Let
		them lose their souls with drugs.
		But something has to be done, we
		can't have everybody running around
		doing just what they please, like a
		bunch of anarchists.

				BARZINI
		Then, are we agreed; the traffic in
		drugs will be permitted, but
		controlled; and Don Corleone agrees
		to give it protection in the East.

	DON CORLEONE nods.

				BARZINI
		That's the whole matter then, we
		have the peace, and let me pay my
		respects to Don Corleone, whom we
		have all known over the years as a
		man of his word.
			  (noticing TATTAGLIA
			  is uneasy)
		Don Philip?

				TATTAGLIA
		I agree to everything here, I'm
		willing to forget my own misfortune.
		But I must hear strict assurance
		from Corleone.  When time goes by
		and his position becomes stronger,
		will he attempt any individual
		vengeance?

	They all look at the DON; especially HAGEN, who feels that
	DON CORLEONE has given a great deal, and must have something
	else in mind.  Slowly the DON rises.

				DON CORLEONE
		I forego my vengeance for my dead
		son, for the common good.  But I
		have selfish reasons.  My youngest
		son had to flee, accused of
		Sollozzo's murder, and I must now
		make arrangements so that he can
		come home with safety, cleared of
		all those false charges.  That is
		my affair, and I will make those
		arrangements.
			  (with strength)
		But I am a superstitious man...and
		so if some unlucky accident should
		befall my youngest son, if some
		police officer should accidentally
		shoot him, or if he should hang
		himself in his cell, or if my son
		is struck by a bolt of lightning,
		then I will blame some of the
		people here.  That, I could never
		forgive, but...aside from that, let
		me swear by the souls of my
		Grandchildren that I will never be
		the one to break the peace we have
		made.

	EXT NITE: DON'S LIMO (SPRING 1946)

	The DON's black limousine.  He sits quietly in the padded
	rear seat; TOM HAGEN next to him.

	It is night.  Lights flash by them every so often.

				HAGEN
		When I meet with Tattaglia's
		people; should I insist that all
		his drug middle-men be clean?

				DON CORLEONE
		Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini
		is a man who will know that without
		being told.

				HAGEN
		You mean Tattaglia.

				DON CORLEONE
			  (shaking his head)
		Barzini.

				HAGEN
			  (a revelation)
		He was the one behind Sollozzo?

				DON CORLEONE
		Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could
		never have outfought Santino.  But
		I wasn't sure until this day.  No,
		it was Barzini all along.

	The black limousine speeds away from us in the night.

	------------------------------------------FADE OUT------

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: ESTABLISHING SICILY SHOT

	A CLOSE VIEW OF MICHAEL, moving as he walks, sullen and
	downcast, the left side of his face healed, but left
	grotesque and misshapen.

	GRADUALLY, THE VIEW LOOSENS, he wears a warm navy Pea
	jacket, and walks with his hands in his pockets.

	THE VIEW LOOSENS FURTHER, revealing a Sicilian SHEPHERD on
	either side of him, each carrying a shotgun slung over his
	shoulder, CALO, a squat and husky young man with a simple
	honest quality, and FABRIZZIO, slender and handsome, likable,
	and with a pleasing build.  Each of the SHEPHERDS  carry
	knapsacks.

	The THREE YOUNG MEN continue over the Sicilian landscape,
	overlooking an impressive view of land and sea.

	EXT DAY: SICILY ROAD

	The THREE move through a flock of wind-blown sheep, and make
	their way to a dusty rural road.  We HEAR a rinky horn
	sound, as a pre-war Italian automobile makes its way to them.
	An OLD MAN peeks from the window, waving to MICHAEL.  The
	car pulls in front of them and stops.  MICHAEL nods
	respectfully.

				MICHAEL
		Don Tommassino.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Michael, why must you do this.  We
		have been lucky so far, all these
		months you've been here we've kept
		your name a secret.  It is from
		love for your father that I've
		asked you never to more than an
		hour from the Villa.

				MICHAEL
		Calo and Fabrizzio are with me;
		nothing will happen.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		You must understand that your
		Father's enemies have friends in
		Palermo.

				MICHAEL
		I know.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Where are you going?

				MICHAEL
		Corleone.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		There is nothing there.  Not anymore.

				MICHAEL
		I was told that my Grandfather was
		murdered on its main street; and
		his murderers came to kill my
		father there when he was twelve
		years old.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Long ago.  Now there is nothing:
		the men killed each other in family
		vendettas...the others escaped to
		America.

				MICHAEL
		Don Tommassino...I should see this
		place.

	DON TOMMASSINO thinks a moment, then concedes.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		That is your birthright...but
		Michael, use this car.

				MICHAEL
		No...I would like to walk to
		Corleone.

	The OLD MAN sighs, and then returns to his car.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Be careful Michael, don't let them
		know your name.

	The old car sputters off; MICHAEL watches, and then continues
	on his journey.

	EXT DAY: COUNTRYSIDE

	The THREE pass through abundant areas of flowers and fruit
	trees, in bloom and bursting with life.

	EXT DAY: VILLAGE

	They continue in the empty streets of a little town; the
	post-war poverty is evident in the skinny dogs; and the
	empty streets.  Occasionally, a military vehicle, the only
	gasoline-powered vehicles on the road, will pass.  And there
	are many POLICE evident, most of them carrying machine guns.

	The THREE pass under an enormous banner slung over the main
	road "VOTA COMMUNISTA".

	EXT DAY: COUNTRY ROAD

	They continue through dusty country roads, where occasionally
	a donkey pulling a cart, or a lone horseman will pass them.

	EXT DAY: FIELD

	Out in a field, in the distance, they come upon a procession
	of peasants and activists, perhaps two hundred strong,
	marching, and singing, and in the lead, are five or six men
	carrying billowing red banners.

	EXT DAY: GROVE

	They are in an orange grove; on the other side of the trees
	is a deep, tall field of wild flowers.

	The Shepherds unsling their guns and knapsacks, and take out
	loaves of bread, some wine, sausage and cheese.

	MICHAEL rests against a tree, and uses his handkerchief.

				FABRIZZIO
		You tell us about America.

				MICHAEL
		How do you know I come from America?

				FABRIZZIO
		We hear.  We were told you were a
		Pezzonovanta...big shot.

				MICHAEL
		Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.

				FABRIZZIO
		Hey America!  Is she as rich as
		they say?

				MICHAEL
		Yes.

				FABRIZZIO
		Take me to America!  You need a
		good lupara in America?
			  (pats his shotgun)
		You take me, I'll be the best man
		you got.  "Oh say, can you
		seeee...By da star early light..."

	MICHAEL laughs.

	EXT DAY: ANOTHER ROAD

	The TRIO continues down a dirt road, as an American Military
	convoy speeds by; FABRIZZIO waves, and calls out to each of
	the U.S. drivers, as they move by.

				FABRIZZIO
		America.
		Hey America!
		Take me with you!
		Hey, take me to America G.I.!

	EXT DAY: CORLEONE HILL

	They continue their long hike, high on a promentory; until
	they hesitate, and look down.

				CALO
		Corleone.

	They can see a grim Sicilian village, almost devoid of people.

	EXT DAY: CORLEONE STREET

	MICHAEL and his bodyguards move through the empty streets of
	the village.  They walk behind him, and spread to either
	side about fifteen feet away from him.

	They move down ancient steps, past an old stone fountain.
	MICHAEL hesitates, cups his hands and drinks some water.
	They go on.

	They move up a very narrow old street.  MICHAEL looks at the
	doorways that they pass.

	MOVING VIEW: Each door has a plaque, with a ribbon or flower.

	CALO sees MICHAEL looking.

				CALO
		The names of the dead.

	MICHAEL hesitates in the center of the main street.  He looks.

	The street is empty, barren.  Occasionally, an old woman
	will pass.

	MICHAEL turns his head.

	The other side of the street: empty and deathly.

	A HIGH VIEW of MICHAEL standing in the center of the old
	street, the shepherds a respectful distance away.

	-------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------

	EXT DAY: BARONIAL ESTATE

	A green ribboned field of a baronial Estate.  Further ahead
	is a villa so Roman it looks as though it had just been
	discovered in the ruins of Pompeii.  There is a group of
	young village GIRLS accompanied by two stocky MATRONS,
	dressed in black.  They have been gathering the pink sulla,
	purple wisteria, and mixing them with orange and lemon
	blossoms.  They are singing, off in the distance as they work.

	MICHAEL, CALO and FABRIZZIO are silent as they watch this
	Fantasy-like scene.

				FABRIZZIO
			  (calling out to them)
		Hey, beautiful girls!

				MICHAEL
			  (sternly)
		Shhhhh.

	He settles down to watch.

	The GIRLS are dressed in cheap gaily painted frocks that
	cling to their bodies.  They are still in their teens, but
	developed and womanly.

	They are moving along the fields, picking blossoms, not
	aware of the three men watching them from the orange grove.
	Three or four of the girls begin chasing one of them
	playfully, in the direction of the grove.

	The GIRL being chased holds a bunch of purple grapes in her
	left hand and with the right, picks more grapes, and throws
	them back at her pursuers laughing.

	They come closer and closer.  Just short of the grove, she
	poses, startled, her large, oval shaped eyes catching the
	view of the THREE MEN.  She stands there on her toes about
	to run.

	MICHAEL sees her; now face to face.  He looks.

	Her face.  Incredibly beautiful with olive skin, black hair
	and a rich mouth.

				FABRIZZIO
			  (murmuring)
		Jesus Christ, take my soul.  I'm
		dying.

	Quickly, she turns, and runs away.

	MICHAEL stands up never taking his eyes from her.  We hold
	on him for a long while; and eventually hear the SHEPHERDS
	laughing.  Then he turns to them.

				FABRIZZIO
		You got hit by the thunderbolt, eh?

	CALO pats him on the shoulder.

				CALO
		Easy man.

				MICHAEL
		What are you talking about?

				FABRIZZIO
		You can't hide it when you're hit
		by the thunderbolt.

	EXT DAY: BARONIAL VILLAGE

	The little village built attendant to the Baronial Estate,
	is decked with the flowers the girls had been picking.

	MICHAEL, followed by the bodyguards, moves into the central
	square, and onto the balcony of a little cafe.

	The proprietor of the cafe, VITELLI, is a short burly man;
	he greets them cheerfully, and sets a dish of chickpeas at
	their table.

				FABRIZZIO
		You know all the girls in this
		town, eh?  We saw some beauties
		coming down the road.  One in
		particular got our friend hit with
		the Thunderbolt...
			  (he indicates MICHAEL)

	VITELLI gives a big knowing laugh, and looks at MICHAEL with
	new interest.

				VITELLI
		You had better bring a few bottles
		home with you, my friend; you'll
		need help sleeping tonight.
			  (he laughs)

				FABRIZZIO
		This one could seduce the devil.  A
		body! and eyes as big and black as
		olives.

				VITELLI
			  (laughing with
			  them...pouring more wine)
		I know about what you mean!

				FABRIZZIO
		This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?

				VITELLI
			  (laughing)
		Beautiful all over, eh?

				FABRIZZIO
		And hair.  Black and curly, like a
		doll.  And such a mouth.

	VITELLI does not laugh quite so much.

				VITELLI
		Yes, we have beautiful girls here...
		but virtuous.

	VITELLI is no longer drinking with them.

				MICHAEL
		She wore a red dress, and a red
		ribbon in her hair.  She looks more
		Greek than Italian.  Do you know a
		beauty like that?

	As MICHAEL describes her, VITELLI laughed less and less,
	until he wears a scowl.

				VITELLI
		No.

	Then he curtly leaves him, and walks into the back room.

				FABRIZZIO
		God in Heaven, I think I
		understand...

	He goes into the back room after the innkeeper.  Then he
	returns.

				FABRIZZIO
		Let's get out of here; he's boiling
		up his blood to do us mischief.
		It's his daughter.

	They start to leave; but MICHAEL doesn't move.

				CALO
		Come quickly.

				MICHAEL
		Innkeeper.  More wine!

				FABRIZZIO
			  (whispered)
		The old bastard mentioned two sons
		he only has to whistle up.

	MICHAEL turns to FABRIZZIO with his cold authority.

				MICHAEL
		Tell him to come to me.

	The two BODYGUARDS shoulder their luparas, and disappear in
	a moment they return with the red-faced angry VITELLI
	between them.

				MICHAEL
			  (quietly)
		I understand I've offended you by
		talking about your daughter.  I
		offer you my apologies, I'm a
		stranger in this country, I don't
		know the customs very well.  Let me
		say this, I meant no disrespect to
		you or her...

	CALO and FABRIZZIO are impressed.

				VITELLI
			  (shrugs)
		Who are you and what do you want
		from my daughter?

				MICHAEL
		I am an American hiding in Sicily
		from the police of my country.  My
		name is Michael.  You can inform
		the police and make your fortune
		but then your daughter would lose a
		father rather than gain a husband.
		In any case, I want to meet your
		daughter.  With your permission and
		under the supervision of your
		family.  With all decorum.  With
		all respect.  I am an honorable man.

	CALO and FABRIZZIO are stupefied; VITELLI pauses, and then
	asks:

				VITELLI
		Are you a friend of the friends?

				MICHAEL
		When the proper time comes, I'll
		tell you everything that a wife's
		father should know.

				FABRIZZIO
		It's the real Thunderbolt, then.

				VITELLI
			  (formally)
		Come Sunday morning:  My name is
		Vitelli and my house is up there on
		the hill, above the village.

				MICHAEL
		Your daughter's name?

				VITELLI
		Appolonia.

	-------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------

	EXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD

	MUSIC comes up; as MICHAEL, dressed in new clothes from
	Palermo, and carrying a stack of wrapped gifts, gets into an
	Alfa Romeo.  CALO and FABRIZZIO each dressed in their Sunday
	best, are in the rear seat, huddled together, with their
	luparas on their shoulders.

	DON TOMMASSINO waves them off, as the little car drives off,
	rocky and bouncing on the dirt road.

	The Sunday churchbells ring.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT DAY: VITELLI HOUSE

	MICHAEL is presented to each of the Vitelli relatives, by
	the yard of their little hilltop house; the BROTHERS; the
	MOTHER, who is given a gift; several UNCLES and AUNTS.
	Finally APPOLONIA enters, dressed beautifully in appropriate
	Sunday clothing.  Now he presents the wrapped gift to
	APPOLONIA.  She looks at her MOTHER, who with a nod gives
	her permission to open it.  She unwraps it.  Her eyes light
	at the sight of a heavy gold chain; to be worn as a necklace.

	She looks at him.

				APPOLONIA
		Grazia.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT DAY: VITELLI CAFE

	Now the little Alpha drives into the village near VITELLI's
	cafe.

	MICHAEL is, as ever, accompanied with his two BODYGUARDS,
	though they are all dressed differently.

	They go up to the cafe...and sit with VITELLI, who is
	talking and talking.

	MICHAEL looks at APPOLONIA; who sits, respectfully quiet.
	She wears the gold necklace around her neck.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT DAY: HILLTOP NEAR VITELLI HOME

	MICHAEL and APPOLONIA are walking through a hilltop path,
	seemingly alone, although a respectful distance apart.

	As the VIEW PANS with them, we notice that her MOTHER and a
	half dozen AUNTS are twenty paces behind them, and ten paces
	further behind are CALO and FABRIZZIO, their luparas on
	their shoulders.

	Further up the hill, APPOLONIA stumbles on a loose stone,
	and falls briefly onto MICHAEL's arm.  She modestly regains
	her balance, and they continue walking.

	Behind them, her MOTHER giggles to herself.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT DAY: VITELLI VILLAGE CHURCH

	Church bells in an ancient belfry ring out.  Music, old and
	dissonant, plays.

	There is a bridal procession in the street of the village;
	the same in feeling and texture as it might have been five
	hundred years ago.

	Donkeys and other animals have been decorated with abundant
	flowers; children carrying candles and wearing white
	confirmation gowns walk in the procession, followed by
	countless townspeople, members of the clergy, even the police.

	We present the entire bridal procession and ceremony with
	all the ritual and pageantry, as it has always been, in
	Sicily.

	APPOLONIA is radiant as the Bride; MICHAEL is handsome
	despite the grotesque jaw and occasional white handkerchief.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT NITE: VITELLI VILLAGE SQUARE

	CALO and FABRIZZIO dance wildly through the night of the
	great wedding celebration.  It is held in the Village
	Square; under the watchful eyes of SHEPHERDS above on the
	tops of buildings, carrying luparas.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	INT NITE: MICHAEL'S ROOM IN VILLA

	MICHAEL opens the shutters in his darkened room; moonlight
	fills the room.

	He turns, and there, in her wedding slip, is APPOLONIA.  A
	little frightened; but lovely.

	He moves to her; and for a moment just stands before her,
	looking at her incredible face; her lovely hair and body.

	Slowly and tenderly he kisses her.  Her tiny hands come up
	to his face; touch his cheek and embrace him.

	She lets her bridal slip fall to the floor.

	--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

	INT DAY: MICHAEL'S ROOM AT VILLA

	Morning.  MICHAEL sits on the window ledge, gazing into the
	room.

	APPOLONIA is asleep; she is naked, and only partially
	covered by the bedsheets.

	He looks at her for a long time in the early morning light.

	EXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD

	HIGH ANGLE ON DON TOMMASSINO'S VILLA

	We HEAR girlish laughter; the little Alpha is driving
	erratically, knocking down an occasional wall, and almost
	hitting th inner court wall.

	APPOLONIA is laughing, driving.  MICHAEL pretends to be
	frightened, as he teaches her to drive.

	Outside the walls, we notice SHEPHERDS with luparas, walking
	guard duty.

	The car stops and a laughing MICHAEL gets out.

				MICHAEL
		It's safer to teach you English.

				APPOLONIA
		Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
		Thursday, Friday...See, I learned
		it.  Now teach me to drive!

	DON TOMMASSINO enters the Courtyard.  He seems tired and
	concerned.

				MICHAEL
		Ciao, Don Tommassino.

	APPOLONIA kisses him.

				MICHAEL
		Things went badly in Palermo?

				DON TOMMASSINO
		The younger men have no respect.
		Things are changing; I don't know
		what will happen.  Michael, because
		of the wedding, people now know
		your name.

				MICHAEL
		Is that why there are more men on
		the walls?

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Even so, I don't think it is safe
		here anymore.  I've made plans to
		move you to a villa near Siracuse.
		You must go right away.

				MICHAEL
		What is it?

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Bad news from America.  Your
		brother, Santino.  He has been
		killed.

	For a moment, the whole world of New York, Sollozzo, the
	Five Family War, all comes back to MICHAEL.

	EXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD

	Morning.  MICHAEL leans out of the bedroom window.

	Below, FABRIZZIO is sitting in one of the garden chairs,
	combing his thick hair.

	MICHAEL whistles and FABRIZZIO looks up to his window.

				MICHAEL
		Get the car.  I'll be leaving in
		ten minutes.  Where's Calo?

				FABRIZZIO
		Calo is having a cup of coffee in
		the kitchen.  Is your wife coming
		with you?

				MICHAEL
		No, she's going home to her family.
		She'll join me in a few weeks...

	INT DAY: VILLA KITCHEN

	MICHAEL, dressed, crosses from the hallway, and into the
	kitchen.  CALO is just finishing a bite.  He rises when he
	sees MICHAEL.

				CALO
		Should I get your bag?

				MICHAEL
		No, I'll get it.  Where's Appolonia?

				CALO
			  (smiling)
		She is sitting in the driver's seat
		of the car, dying to step on the
		gas.  She'll be a real American
		woman before she gets to America.

	MICHAEL smiles.

				MICHAEL
		Tell Fabrizzio and wait for me in
		the car.

	He leaves the kitchen, after a quick sip of coffee.

	He looks out from the opening in the doorway.

	EXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD

	There is the car, with APPOLONIA sitting in the driver's
	seat, playing with the wheel like a child.

	CALO moves to the car, and puts a lunch basket in the rear
	seat.

	Then MICHAEL seems disturbed.

	Over, on the other side of the courtyard, he sees FABRIZZIO
	disappear through the gate.

				MICHAEL
			  (muttering to himself)
		Where the hell is he going?

	MICHAEL goes down the hallway, and outside.

	MICHAEL steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer
	courtyard, causing him to shade his eyes.

	APPOLONIA sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay
	where he is.

				APPOLONIA
			  (calling out)
		I'll drive to you.

	He smiles affectionately.

	CALO stands beside the car, smiling, with his lupara dangling
	by his side.  There is no sight of FABRIZZIO.  Suddenly the
	smile fades from MICHAEL's face.  He steps forward and holds
	out his hand.

				MICHAEL
		No.  No!

	His shout is drowned in the roar of a tremendous EXPLOSION,
	as she switched on the ignition.

	Part of the wall is caved in, the kitchen door is blown off;
	and there is nothing left of the Alpha, or of Appolonia.

	MICHAEL is thrown against the wall, and knocked unconscious.

	INT DAY: VILLA BEDROOM

	MICHAEL is unconscious in a darkened room.  We hear
	whispering around him, but can't make any of it out.  A soft
	cloth is applied to his face; gradually his eyes open.  DON
	TOMMASSINO is there, close to him.  He looks at them and
	from their grave expressions, he knows his wife is dead.

				MICHAEL
		Fabrizzio.  Let your shepherds know
		that the one who gives me Fabrizzio
		will own the finest pastures in
		Sicily.

	--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1951)

	Easter.

	A HIGH VIEW ON THE CORLEONE MALL in the springtime.  Hordes
	of little CHILDREN including many of the Corleone Children
	and Grandchilren, rush about carrying little Easter baskets,
	searching here and there for candy treasures and hidden
	Easter eggs.

	The DON himself, much older, much smaller in size, wearing
	baggy pants and a plaid shirt and an old hat, moves around
	his garden, tending rows and rows of rich tomato plants.

	Suddenly, he stops and looks.

	MICHAEL stands there, still holding his suitcase.

	Great emotion comes over the DON, who takes a few steps in
	MICHAEL's direction.

	MICHAEL leaves his suitcase and walks to his favorite son
	and embraces him.

				DON CORLEONE
		Be my son...

	INT DAY: THE OLIVE OIL FACTORY

	DON CORLEONE leads MICHAEL through the corridors of the
	building.

				DON CORLEONE
		This old building has seen its day.
		No way to do business...too small,
		too old.

	They enter the DON's glass-panelled office.

				DON CORLEONE
		Have you thought about a wife?  A
		family?

				MICHAEL
			  (pained)
		No.

				DON CORLEONE
		I understand, Michael.  But you
		must make a family, you know.

				MICHAEL
		I want children, I want a family.
		But I don't know when.

				DON CORLEONE
		Accept what's happened, Michael.

				MICHAEL
		I could accept everything that's
		happened; I could accept it, but
		that I never had a choice.  From
		the time I was born, you had laid
		this all out for me.

				DON CORLEONE
		No, I wanted other things for you.

				MICHAEL
		You wanted me to be your son.

				DON CORLEONE
		Yes, but sons who would be
		professors, scientists,
		musicians...and grandchildren who
		could be, who knows, a Governor, a
		President even, nothing's impossible
		here in America.

				MICHAEL
		Then why have I become a man like
		you?

				DON CORLEONE
		You are like me, we refuse to be
		fools, to be puppets dancing on a
		string pulled by other men.  I
		hoped the time for guns and killing
		and massacres was over.  That was
		my misfortune.  That was your
		misfortune.  I was hunted on the
		streets of Corleone when I was
		twelve years old because of who my
		father was.  I had no choice.

				MICHAEL
		A man has to choose what he will be.
		I believe that.

				DON CORLEONE
		What else do you believe in?

	MICHAEL doesn't answer.

				DON CORLEONE
		Believe in a family.  Can you
		believe in your country?  Those
		Pezzonovante of the State who
		decide what we shall do with our
		lives?  Who declare wars they wish
		us to fight in to protect what they
		own.  Do you put your fate in the
		hands of men whose only talent is
		that they tricked a bloc of people
		to vote for them?  Michael, in five
		years the Corleone family can be
		completely legitimate.  Very
		difficult things have to happen to
		make that possible.  I can't do
		them anymore, but you can, if you
		choose to.

	MICHAEL listens.

				DON CORLEONE
		Believe in a family; believe in a
		Code of Honor, older and higher,
		believe in Roots that go back
		thousands of years into your Race.
		Make a family, Michael, and protect
		it.  These are our affairs, sono cosa
		nostra, Governments only protect
		men who have their own individual
		power.  Be one of those men...you
		have the choice.

	--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

	EXT DAY: STOCK FOOTAGE LAS VEGAS (1955)

	A MOVING VIEW, driving up the Las Vegas Strip of 1955.

				FREDO (O.S.)
		There's a new one.  Construction
		going on everywhere.

	MORE VIEWS, showing new hotels and casinos being built; the
	bill marquees read: "MARTIN AND LEWIS", "PATTI PAGE", etc.

				FREDO (O.S.)
		That's one of the family's new ones.
		Not bad, eh?

	EXT DAY: FLAMINGO (1955)

	The car pulls up at the Flamingo Hotel.

	Inside the car: MICHAEL, FREDO, TOM HAGEN and a new man,
	NERI, quiet and sinister.

				MICHAEL
		Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the
		airport?

				FREDO
		He had business at the hotel, but
		he'll drop in for dinner.

	From the expression on MICHAEL's face we know this is a
	discourtesy.

	INT DAY: FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE (1955)

	A whole entourage precedes FREDO and his V.I.P. party of
	MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI.  Great fuss is made.  They are
	being shown into the hotel's 'special' suite.

				FREDO
		You look wonderful, kid; really
		wonderful.  That doctor did some
		job on your face.

				MICHAEL
		You look good, too.

	They enter the suite.

				FREDO
		Nice, eh?

	FREDO is as excited as a kid, snapping orders at the
	bellboys, waiters and maids.

				FREDO
			  (hurrying into the bedroom)
		Kid, take a look-see.

	MICHAEL gives a look to HAGEN, and continues into the bedroom.

	There is an enormous circular bed on a huge platform,
	mirrors to each side.  FREDO points upward.

	A VIEW into a large CEILING mirror.

				FREDO
		Ever seen anything like that before?

				MICHAEL
			  (dryly)
		No.

	INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE BEDROOM (1955)

	MICHAEL is alone in the bedroom.  He is just finishing
	dressing; he puts on his jacket.  From the window, with the
	lights blinking, we can tell it's late at night.  MICHAEL
	passes into the other room.

	He stops, looks.  He is disturbed.

	INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)

	A magnificent, circular table has been set up in his suite;
	a lavish table setting for eight.  Standing by the table are
	HAGEN, JOHNNY FONTANE, looking wonderful, a little heavier,
	beautifully dressed; FREDO, a dandy, and TWO LAS VEGAS GIRLS.
	NERI stands quietly by the door.

				FREDO
		Mike!  The party starting!

				MICHAEL
		Come here a minute, Fredo.

	FREDO goes to him, a big smile all over his face.

				MICHAEL
		Who are those girls?

				FREDO
			  (jokingly)
		That's for you to find out.

				MICHAEL
		Give them some money and send them
		home.

				FREDO
		Mike!

				MICHAEL
		Get rid of them...

	INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)

	They are seated around the lavish table in Michael's suite.
	MICHAEL is speaking to JOHNNY.

				MICHAEL
		Johnny, the Corleone family is
		thinking of selling out all our
		interests in the Olive Oil business
		and settling here.  Moe Greene will
		sell us his interest so it can be
		wholly owned by friends of the
		family.

	FREDDIE seems anxious.

				FREDO
		Mike, you sure about Moe selling.
		He never mentioned it to me and he
		loves the business.

				MICHAEL
		I'll make him an offer he can't
		refuse.

	MICHAEL turns to JOHNNY.

				MICHAEL
		Johnny, the Don wants you to help
		us get started.  We figure
		entertainment will be the big
		factor in drawing gamblers.  We
		hope you'll sign a contract to
		appear five times a year for maybe
		a week long engagement.
		We hope your friends in the movies
		will do the same.  We count on you
		to convince them.

				JOHNNY
		Sure, I'll do anything for my
		Godfather.  You know that, Mike.

	There is knock on the door.  NERI rises, looks at MICHAEL,
	who nods.  NERI opens the door, and MOE GREENE enters,
	followed by TWO BODYGUARDS.  He is a handsome hood, dressed
	in the Hollywood style.  His BODYGUARDS are more West Coast
	style.

				MOE
		Mike, good to see you.  Got
		everything you want?

				MICHAEL
		Thanks.

				MOE
		The chef cooked for you special;
		the dancers will kick your tongue
		out and you credit is good!
			  (to his BODYGUARDS)
		Draw chips for all these people so
		they can play on the house.

				MICHAEL
		Is my credit good enough to buy you
		out?

	MOE laughs.

				MOE
		Buy me out?...

				MICHAEL
		The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone
		family wants to buy you out.

	GREENE stops laughing; the room becomes tense.  NERI eyes
	the BODYGUARDS.

				MOE
			  (furious)
		The Corleone family wants to buy me
		out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy
		me out.

				MICHAEL
		Your casino loses money.  Maybe we
		can do better.

				MOE
		You think I scam?

				MICHAEL
			  (the worst insult)
		You're unlucky.

				MOE
		You goddamn dagos.  I do you a
		favor and take Freddie in when
		you're having a bad time, and then
		you try to push me out.

				MICHAEL
		You took Freddie in because the
		Corleone family bankrolled your
		casino.  You and the Corleone
		family are evened out.  This is for
		business; name your price.

				MOE
		The Corleone family don't have that
		kind of muscle anymore.  The
		Godfather is sick.  You're getting
		chased out of New York by Barzini
		and the other families, and you
		think you can find easier pickings
		here.  I've talked to Barzini; I
		can make a deal with him and keep
		my hotel!

				MICHAEL
			  (quietly, deadly)
		Is that why you thought you could
		slap Freddie around in public?

				FREDO
			  (his face turns red)
		Ah Mike, that was nothing.  Moe
		didn't mean anything.  He flies off
		the handle sometimes; but me and
		him are good friends.  Right, Moe?

				MOE
		Yeah sure.  Sometimes I gotta kick
		asses to make this place run right.
		Freddie and I had a little argument
		and I had to straighten him out.

				MICHAEL
		You straightened my brother out?

				MOE
		Hell, he was banging cocktail
		waitresses two at a time.  Players
		couldn't get a drink.

	MICHAEL rises from his chair, and says in a tone of dismissal:

				MICHAEL
		I have to go back to New York
		tomorrow.  Think of your price.

				MOE
		You son of a bitch, you think you
		can brush me off like that?  I made
		my bones when you were going out
		with cheerleaders.

				FREDO
			  (frightened)
		Tom, you're the Consigliere; you
		can talk to the Don and advise him.

				MICHAEL
		The Don has semi-retired.  I'm
		running the Family business now.
		So anything you have to say, say it
		to me.

	Nobody answers.  MICHAEL nods to NERI, who opens the door.
	MOE exits angrily.

				MICHAEL
		Freddie, you're my older brother.
		I love you.  But don't ever take
		sides with anybody against the
		Family again.

	EXT DAY: N.Y. AIRPORT (1955)

	KAY sits in the back of a limousine parked by the Newark
	AIRPORT.  ROCCO LAMPONE is leaning against it.

	She has a little three year old boy; MICHAEL's son, who
	plays with a cardboard bird on a string.

	Two other cars are stationed discreetly, with men we have
	learned to tell are bodyguards.

	MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI exit the airport with TWO NEGRO
	PORTERS carrying luggage.

	NERI sees something, and taps MICHAEL on the shoulder.

	MICHAEL turns, and sees KAY.

	LAMPONE opens the car door; KAY steps out with the BOY, and
	MICHAEL embraces her, and kisses his son.  Automatically,
	the luggage is put in.  NERI replaces LAMPONE as the driver;
	and LAMPONE joins the other men.  HAGEN gets into one of the
	other cars.

	And the limo drives off, preceded and followed by the other
	sedans.

	INT DAY: LIMO (1955)

	The little BOY looks out the window as they drive.

				MICHAEL
		I have to see my father and his
		people when we get back to the Mall.

				KAY
		Oh Michael.

				MICHAEL
		We'll go to the show tomorrow
		night--we can change the tickets.

				KAY
		Don't you want dinner first?

				MICHAEL
		No, you eat...don't wait up for me.

				KAY
		Wake me up when you come to bed?

	The little BOY flies his cardboard bird out of the speeding
	limousine window.

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	The limousine arrives at the Mall.  We are inside.

				KAY
		Your sister wants to ask you
		something.

				MICHAEL
		Let HER ask.

	NERI opens the door.  KAY wants to talk just a little more.

				KAY
		She's afraid to.  Michael...

	MICHAEL nods to NERI; who gives them their privacy a moment
	longer.

				KAY
		Why are you so cold to her and
		Carlo?  They live with us on the
		Mall now, but you never get close
		to them.

				MICHAEL
		I'm busy.

				KAY
		Connie and Carlo want you to be
		godfather to their little boy.

	NERI opens the door; MICHAEL starts to get out; KAY too.

	He smiles at her, tired, and a little sad.

				KAY
		Will you?

				MICHAEL
		Let me think about it, O.K.?

	She smiles; MICHAEL goes with NERI to the Main House; KAY
	and the little BOY move to the house that was Sonny's.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (1955)

	VIEW ON DON CORLEONE, much older, much smaller in size.  He
	wears baggy pants, and a warm plaid shirt.  He sits in a
	chair, gazing out through the window, into the garden.

				TESSIO (O.S.)
		Barzini's people chisel my territory
		and we do nothing about it.  Pretty
		soon there won't be one place in
		Brooklyn I can hang my hat.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		Just be patient.

				TESSIO
		I'm not asking you for help, Mike.
		Just take off the handcuffs.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		Be patient.

				CLEMENZA (O.S.)
		We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at
		least recruit our regimes to full
		strength.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		No, I don't want to give Barzini an
		excuse to start fighting.

				TESSIO (O.S.)
		Mike, you're wrong.

				CLEMENZA (O.S.)
		Don Corleone...Don Corleone.

	The OLD MAN looks up.  CLEMENZA stand before him in the Den.
	Beside him is an anxious TESSIO.  NERI stands by the door;
	HAGEN is seated; MICHAEL sits behind the big desk.

				CLEMENZA
		You said there would come a day
		when Tessio and me could form our
		own Families.  Only with your
		benediction, of course.  I ask
		permission...

				DON CORLEONE
		My son is head of the Family now.
		If you have his permission, you
		have my good will.

				MICHAEL
		In six months you can break off
		from the Corleone Family and go on
		your own.  Carlo, I'm counting on
		you to make the move to Nevada;
		you'll be my right-hand man out
		there.  Tom Hagen is no longer the
		Consigliere.

	Everyone is a bit surprised; look to see HAGEN's reaction.
	He remains inexpressive.

				MICHAEL
		He's going to be our lawyer in
		Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any
		other business as of now, this
		minute.  No reflection on Tom;
		that's the way I want it.  Besides,
		if I ever need any advice, who's a
		better Consigliere than my father.

				CLEMENZA
		Then in a six month time we're on
		our own; is that it?

				MICHAEL
		Maybe less...

				TESSIO
		Let us fill up our Regimes.

				MICHAEL
		No.  I want things very calm for
		another six months.

				TESSIO
		Forgive me, Godfather, let our
		years of friendship be my excuse.
		How can you hope for success there
		without your strength here to back
		you up?  The two  go hand in hand.
		And with you gone from here the
		Barzini and the Tattaglias will be
		too strong for us.

				CLEMENZA
		And I don't like Barzini.  I say
		the Corleone Family has to move
		from strength, not weakness.  We
		should build our Regimes and take
		back our lost territories in Staten
		Island, at least.

				DON CORLEONE
		Do you have faith in my judgement?

				CLEMENZA
		Yes, Godfather...

				DON CORLEONE
		Then do what Michael says...

				MICHAEL
		All I can say is that things are
		being resolved that are more
		effective than a thousand buttonmen
		on the streets.  Understood?

	There are uneasy looks all around.

				CARLO
		Understood.  I just wish I was
		doing more to help out.

				MICHAEL
		I'll come to you when I need you.

	He looks at CLEMENZA, TESSIO and HAGEN.  They all nod,
	reluctantly.

				MICHAEL
		All right, then it's resolved.

	NERI knows the meeting is over, he opens the Den's door.

	CLEMENZA and TESSIO pay their respects to the DON and leave,
	then CARLO.  NERI watches CARLO as he walks down the
	corridor, casting a nervous look back at the sinister man.

	Then NERI closes the door.

	MICHAEL relaxes.

				HAGEN
		Mike, why are you cutting me out of
		the action?

				MICHAEL
		Tom, we're going to be legitimate
		all the way, and you're the legal
		man.  What could be more important
		than that.

				HAGEN
		I'm not talking about that.  I'm
		talking about Rocco Lampone building
		a secret regime.  Why does Neri
		report directly to you, rather than
		through me or a caporegime?

				DON CORLEONE
		I told you that it wouldn't escape
		his eye.

				MICHAEL
		How did you find out?

				HAGEN
		Bookkeepers know everything.
		Rocco's men are all a little too
		good for the jobs they're supposed
		to be doing.  They get a little
		more money than the job's worth.
			  (pause)
		Lampone's a good man; he's operating
		perfectly.

				MICHAEL
		Not so perfectly if you noticed.

				HAGEN
		Mike, why am I out?

				MICHAEL
		You're not a wartime Consigliere.
		Things may get tough with the move
		we're trying.

				HAGEN
		OK, but then I agree with Tessio.
		You're going about it all wrong;
		you're making the move out of
		weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and
		if he tears you apart, the other
		families won't come running to help
		the Corleones...

				DON CORLEONE
		Tom, I never thought you were a bad
		Consigliere, I thought Santino a
		bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a
		good heart but he wasn't the right
		man to head the family when I had
		my misfortune.  Michael has all my
		confidence, as you do.  For reasons
		which you can't know, you must have
		no part in what will happen.

				HAGEN
		Maybe I can help.

				MICHAEL
			  (coldly)
		You're out, Tom.

	TOM pauses, thinks...and then he nods in acquiescence.  TOM
	leaves.

	MICHAEL looks at NERI.

				MICHAEL
		I'm going to talk to my father.

	NERI nods, and then leaves.  The DON opens the doors,
	breathes in the air, and steps outside.

	EXT DAY: THE GARDEN (1955)

				DON CORLEONE
		I see you have your Luca Brasi.

				MICHAEL
		I'll need him.

				DON CORLEONE
		There are men in this world who
		demand to be killed.  They argue in
		gambling games; they jump out of
		their cars in a rage if someone so
		much as scratches their fender.
		These people wander through the
		streets calling out "Kill me, kill
		me."  Luca Brasi was like that.
		And since he wasn't scared of
		death, and in fact, looked for
		it...I made him my weapon.  Because
		I was the only person in the world
		that he truly hoped would not kill
		him.  I think you have done the
		same with this man.

	They walk through the DON's vegetable garden.  Tomatoes,
	peppers, carefully tended, and covered with a silky netting.
	MICHAEL follows; the DON turns and looks at him.  Then
	stoops over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over.

				DON CORLEONE
		Barzini will move against you first.

				MICHAEL
		How?

				DON CORLEONE
		He will get in touch with you
		through someone you absolutely
		trust.  That person will arrange a
		meeting, guarantee your safety...

	He rises, and looks at Michael...

				DON CORLEONE
		...and at that meeting you will be
		assassinated.

	The DON walks on further.

				DON CORLEONE
		Your wife and children...you're
		happy with them?

				MICHAEL
		Yes.

				DON CORLEONE
		Good.

	MICHAEL wants to express something...hesitates, then:

				MICHAEL
		I've always respected you...

	A long silence.  The DON smiles at MICHAEL.

				DON CORLEONE
		And I...you.

	EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	KAY and MAMA walking from the black car that has just left
	them off.

				KAY
		How is your husband feeling?

				MAMA
		He's not the same since they shot
		him.  He lets Michael do all the
		work.  He just plays the fool with
		his garden, his peppers, his
		tomatoes, as if he was some peasant
		still.  But men are like that...

	She stops toward the Church.

				MAMA
		You come in, too.

	KAY shakes her head.

				MAMA
		The Priest ain't gonna bite you
		cause you're not Catholic.
			  (whispered)
		He's in the back drinkin' his wine.

	KAY laughs and follows MAMA up the steps of the Church.
	They enter.

	INT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	Inside the Church, KAY watches as MAMA blesses herself from
	the holy water.

				MAMA
		You can.

	Tentatively, KAY dips her fingers into the water, and
	blesses herself.  Then SHE follows MAMA down the aisle, in
	awe at the high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally
	the Altar.

	MAMA stops by the impressive tiers of candles.  There is a
	large coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting
	candles.  MAMA fumbles in her purse for change; KAY gives
	her some.

	MAMA drops the coins in the box, one by one; then takes the
	taper, and in a pattern known only to her, and with great
	dignity, she closes her eyes, says a prayer, and then lights
	twenty candles.

	She finishes, and bows her head.

	EXT DAY: BONASERA'S FUNERAL HOME

	Very few people in the streets.  TOTAL SILENCE.  But black
	flower cars as far as the eye can see, for blocks and blocks.
	An expression of respect, of honor and fear that is enormous.
	Certainly no more could be done for a President or a King.

	Each car carries an elaborate floral decoration.  We show
	these in detail; and the flowered messages: "A Benefactor to
	Mankind", "He Knew and Pitied"..."Our Don Our Leader"..."The
	Sacred Heart"...

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL

	Silence.

	The flower cars, funeral limousines, and private cars fill
	all the areas attendant to the Corleone residence.

	Hundreds of people fill the Mall, reminiscent in size of the
	wedding of Connie and Carlo; of course, now the mood is
	somber and respectful.

	MICHAEL, MAMA, FREDO and HAGEN stand by the flowered platform
	which holds the ornate coffin.  We cannot see the remains of
	Don Corleone.

	BONASERA is nearby, ready to do service to the bereaved
	family.  One by one the mourners come by, weeping, or merely
	with grave expressions; pay their respects and continue on.

	The VIEW ALTERS,

	and we see that the line is endless.  JOHNNY FONTANE, tears
	openly falling, takes his turn.

	Children are taken by the hand, and lifted for their last
	look at the great man.

	CLEMENZA whispers into the ear of LAMPONE.  LAMPONE
	immediately arranges for the members of the Five New York
	Families to pay their respects.

	First CUNEO, then STRACHI and then ZALUCHI.  Then PHILIP
	TATTAGLIA, who merely passes by the Coffin.

	Then BARZINI in a black homburg, standing a long time.

	MICHAEL watches the scene.

	BARZINI crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined
	by his men.

	As BARZINI leaves, it seems as though everyone is fawning on
	him; perhaps asking for favors: But at any rate, it is clear
	from the doors opened for him, the cigars lit for him, that
	he is the new Capo di Capi--the place formerly held by Don
	Corleone.

	MICHAEL watches silently.

	BARZINI is searching for somebody with his eyes.  First
	CLEMENZA.  Then TESSIO.

	CONNIE rushes into MICHAEL's arms, tears in her eyes.  He
	embraces and comforts her.

	Everywhere MICHAEL goes, NERI is a few feet away--watching
	all who come close to him.

	EXT DAY: MALL (LATER)

	Later on the Mall; some people have left, although there are
	still hundreds of mourners.

	A young GIRL approaches TESSIO.  She's about 18.

				GIRL
		Do you remember me?

				TESSIO
		No...

				GIRL
		We danced together at Connie's
		wedding.

	TESSIO makes a gesture, which is to say 'How you've grown',
	and they move though the crowd, looking for Michael.  He
	finds him.

				TESSIO
		Mike, could I have a minute?

	MIKE; nods; and they move to a private place.  NERI is close
	by.

				TESSIO
		Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.
		Says we can straighten any of our
		problems out.

				MICHAEL
		He talked to you?

				TESSIO
			  (nods)
		I can arrange security.

	MICHAEL looks at him.

	EXT DAY: CEMETERY (1955)

	The Cemetery.  Late day.

	The hundreds of cars, limousines and flower cars line the
	stone wall that surrounds this Italian-Catholic cemetary in
	Queens Village.

	Hundreds of people stand in a cluster; others watch; take
	pictures, etc.

	MICHAEL stands with his family, his MOTHER...and TOM HAGEN.

				MICHAEL
			  (softly)
		Christ, Tom; I needed more time
		with him.  I really needed him.

				HAGEN
		Did he give you his politicians?

				MICHAEL
		Not all...I needed another four
		months and I would have had them
		all.
			  (he looks at TOM)
		I guess you've figured it all out?

				HAGEN
		How will they come at you?

				MICHAEL
		I know now.
			  (a passion wells up
			  inside of MICHAEL)
		I'll make them call me Don.

				HAGEN
		Have you agreed on a meeting?

				MICHAEL
			  (nods)
		A week from tonight.  In Brooklyn
		on Tessio's ground, where I'll be
		safe.

	HAGEN looks at him; understands.

				MICHAEL
		But after the Baptism.  I've
		decided to stand as godfather to
		Connie's baby.

	They look up.

	The coffin is lowered into an excavation, behind which
	stands an enormous stone monument; it is of a weeping angel,
	with the bold inscription: CORLEONE.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	INT DAY: NERI'S APT. (1955)

	ALBERT NERI moves around in his small Corona Apartment; he
	pulls a small trunk from under his bed.  He opens it, and we
	see in it, nearly folded, a New York City Policeman's
	uniform.  He takes it out piece by piece, almost reverently.
	Then the badge, and the identification card; with his
	picture on it.  Slowly, in the solitude of his room, he
	begins to dress.

	INT DAY: MICHAEL'S BEDROOM (1955)

	MICHAEL and KAY are getting dressed for the christening in
	their room.  MICHAEL looks very well; very calm; KAY is
	beginning to take on a matronly look.

	INT DAY: MOTEL ROOM (1955)

	In a Long Island motel.

	ROCCO LAMPONE carefully disassembles a revolver; oils it,
	checks it, and puts it back together.

	EXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (1955)

	PETER CLEMENZA about to get in his Lincoln.  He hesitates,
	takes a rag and cleans some dirt off of the fender, and then
	gets in, drives off.

	EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	The Church.

	Various relatives and friends are beginning to gather at the
	Church.  They laugh and talk.  A MONSIGNOR is officiating.
	Not all of the participants have arrived yet.

	CONNIE is there, with a beaming CARLO.  She holds the
	infant; showing him off to interested people.

	EXT DAY: U.N. PLAZA (1955)

	NERI walks down the sidewalk in the neighborhood of the UN
	Building.  He is dressed as, and has the bearing of, a
	policeman.  He carries a huge flashlight.

	EXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY (1955)

	LAMPONE steps out onto the little balcony of a Sea-Resort
	Motel; We can see the bright, neon lit sign advertising
	"ROOMS FACING THE SEA--VACANY".

	INT DAY: CHURCH

	The Church.

	CONNIE holds the baby; the MONSIGNOR is speaking; KAY and
	MICHAEL stand side by side around the urn.

				PRIEST
			  (to MICHAEL)
		Do you pledge to guide and protect
		this child if he is left fatherless?
		Do you promise to shield him
		against the wickedness of the world?

				MICHAEL
		Yes, I promise.

	EXT DAY: FIFTH AVE.

	NERI continues up the 55th St. and Fifth Avenue area.  He
	continues until he is in front of Rockefeller Center.  On
	his side of the street, he spots a limousine waiting directly
	across from the main entrance of the building.  Slowly he
	approaches the limo, and taps on its fender with his
	nightstick.

	The DRIVER looks up in surprise.

	NERI points to the "No Parking" sign.

	The DRIVER turns his head away.

				NERI
		OK, wise guy, you wanna summons, or
		you wanna move?

				DRIVER
			  (obviously a hood)
		You better check with your precinct.

				NERI
		Move it!

	The DRIVER takes a ten dollar bill, folds it deliberately,
	and hands it out the window, trying to put it under NERI's
	jacket.

	NERI backs up, letting the bill fall onto the street.  Then
	he crooks a finger at the DRIVER.

				NERI
		Let me see you license and
		registration.

	EXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY

	LAMPONE on the motel balcony spots a Cadillac pulling up.
	It parks.  A young, pretty GIRL gets out.  Quickly, he
	returns into the room.

	INT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)

	CLEMENZA is climbing the back stairs of a large hotel.  He
	rounds the corner, puffs a little, and then continues upward.

	INT DAY: CHURCH

	The Church.  Close on the PRIEST's fingers as he gently
	applies oil to the infant's ears and nostrils.

				PRIEST
		Ephetha...be opened...So you may
		perceive the fragrance of God's
		sweetness.

	EXT DAY: ROCKEFELLER CENTER (1955)

	The DRIVER of the limousine in front of Rockefeller Center
	is arguing with NERI.

	Now the DRIVER looks up.

	WHAT HE SEES:

	TWO MEN in topcoats exit the building, through the revolving
	glass doors.

	NERI opens up fire, trapping BARZINI in the shattering glass
	doors.  The doors still rotate, moving the dead body of
	BARZINI within them.

	INT DAY: CHURCH

	In the Church--the VIEW on MICHAEL.  The PRIEST hands him
	the infant.

				PRIEST
		Do you renounce Satan.

				MICHAEL
		I do renounce him.

				PRIEST
		And all his works?

				MICHAEL
		I do renounce them.

	INT DAY: MOTEL MURDER (1955)

	LAMPONE, backed up by two other MEN in his regime, runs down
	the iron-rail steps, and kicks in the door on Room 7F.
	PHILIP TATTAGLIA, old and wizened and naked, leaps up; a
	semi-nude young GIRL leans up.

	They are riddled with gunfire.

	INT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)

	CLEMENZA, huffing and puffing, climbs the back stairs, with
	his package.

	INT DAY: CHURCH

	The PRIEST pours water over the forehead of the infant
	MICHAEL holds.

				PRIEST
		Do you wish to be baptized?

				MICHAEL
		I do wish to be baptized.

	INT DAY: HOTEL ELEVATOR MURDER (1955)

	CLEMENZA, out of breath, climbs the final few steps.

	He walks through some glass doors, and moves to an ornate
	elevator waiting shaft.

	The lights indicate the elevator has arrived.

	The doors open, and we see a surprised CUNEO standing with
	the dapper MOE GREENE.

	CLEMENZA fires into the small elevator with a shotgun.

	The PRIEST hands a lighted candle to MICHAEL.

				PRIEST
		I christen you Michael Francis Rizzi.

	Flash bulbs go off.  Everyone is smiles, and crowds around
	MICHAEL, KAY, CONNIE...and CARLO.

	--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

	EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	The christening party outside the Church.

	Four or five limousines have been waiting; now pull up to
	receive MAMA, CONNIE and the baby; and the others.

	Everyone is very happy; only MICHAEL seems aloof and grave.

	As the fuss is going on, a car pulls up.  LAMPONE gets out
	and works his way to MICHAEL.  He whispers in his ear.  This
	is the news MICHAEL has been waiting for.

	CONNIE holds the baby up to MICHAEL.

				CONNIE
		Kiss your Godfather.

	The infant turns its head, and MICHAEL uses that as an
	excuse to back away.

				MICHAEL
		Carlo...we've had a change in the
		plans.  Mama, Connie, Kay and the
		kids will have to take the trip out
		to Vegas without us.

				CONNIE
		Oh Mike, it's our first vacation
		together.

				CARLO
			  (anxious to please)
		Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...

				MICHAEL
		Go back to your house and wait for
		me...

	He kisses KAY.

				MICHAEL
			  (to KAY)
		I'll just be a couple of days...

	People are guided to the correct limousines; they start to
	drive off.

	INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN

	TESSIO sits in the Kitchen of the Main House on the Mall.

	HAGEN enters.

				HAGEN
		You'd better make your call to
		Barzini; Michael's ready.

	TESSIO nods; moves to the telephone and dials a number.

				TESSIO
		We're on our way to Brooklyn.

	He hangs up and smiles.

				TESSIO
		I hope Mike can get us a good deal
		tonight.

				HAGEN
			  (gravely)
		I'm sure he will.

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	The TWO MEN walk out onto the Mall, toward a car.  On their
	way they are stopped by TWO BODYGUARDS.

				BUTTON MAN
		The boss says he'll come in a
		separate car.  He says for you two
		to go on ahead.

				TESSIO
			  (frowning)
		Hell, he can't do that.  It screws
		up all my arrangements.

	THREE MORE BODYGUARDS appear around him.

				HAGEN
			  (gently)
		I can't go with you either, Tessio.

	He flashes at the men surrounding him; for a moment he
	panics, and then he accepts it.

				TESSIO
			  (after the pause)
		Tell Mike it was business...I
		always liked him.

				HAGEN
		He understands that.

	TESSIO looks at the men, and then pauses.

				TESSIO
			  (softly)
		Tom, can you get me off the hook?
		For old times' sake?

				HAGEN
		I can't.

	HAGEN turns, and walks away from the group.  Then about
	twenty paces away, he stops, and looks back.

	TESSIO is led into a waiting car.

	HAGEN looks away, and walks off.

	INT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

	CARLO RIZZI is alone in his house, smoking, waiting rather
	nervously.  He moves to the window and looks out.

	WHAT HE SEES:

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	MICHAEL, still dressed in a dark suit; followed by NERI,
	LAMPONE and CLEMENZA, then HAGEN.

	They move toward us.

	Excitedly, CARLO moves to the front door; opens it.

	He wears a broad smile.

				CARLO
		Godfather!

				MICHAEL
		You have to answer for Santino.

	The smile on CARLO's face slowly fades, then, in a foolish
	attempt for safety, he slams the door in their faces and
	backs into the living room.

	INT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

	The door opens, and the grim party enters.

				MICHAEL
		You fingered Sonny for the Barzini
		people.  That little farce you
		played out with my sister.  Did
		Barzini kid you that would fool a
		Corleone?

				CARLO
			  (dignity)
		I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on
		the head of my children, I'm
		innocent.  Mike, don't do this to
		me, please Mike, don't do this to me!

				MICHAEL
			  (quietly)
		Barzini is dead.  So is Philip
		Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo
		and Moe Greene...I want to square
		all the family accounts tonight.
		So don't tell me you're innocent;
		admit what you did.

	CARLO is silent; he wants to talk but is terrified.

				MICHAEL
			  (almost kindly)
		Don't be frightened.  Do you think
		I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you
		think I'd make your children
		fatherless?  After all, I'm
		Godfather to your son.  No, your
		punishment is that you're out of
		the family business.  I'm putting
		you on a plane to Vegas--and I want
		you to stay there.  I'll send
		Connie an allowance, that's all.
		But don't keep saying you're
		innocent; it insults my intelligence
		and makes me angry.  Who approached
		you, Tattaglia or Barzini?

				CARLO
			  (sees his way out)
		Barzini.

				MICHAEL
			  (softly)
		Good, good.  Leave now; there's a
		car waiting to take you to the
		airport.

	CARLO moves to the door; opens it.  There is a car waiting;
	with a group of MEN around it.

	He looks back at MICHAEL, who reassures him.

				MICHAEL
		I'll call your wife and tell her
		what flight you're on.

	EXT DAY: MALL

	CARLO moves out to the Mall; the BUTTONMEN are putting his
	things in the trunk.

	ONE opens the front door for him.

	SOMEONE is sitting in the rear seat, though we cannot see who.

	CARLO gets into the car; out of nervousness, he looks back
	to see the other man.

	It is CLEMENZA, who nods cordially.

	The motor starts, and as the car pulls away, CLEMENZA
	suddenly throws the garrote around CARLO's neck.  He chokes
	and leaps up like a fish on a line, kicking his feet.

	The garrote is pulled tighter; CARLO's face turns color.

	His thrashing feet kick right through the front windshield.

	Then the body goes slack.

	CLEMENZA makes a foul face, and opens the window as the car
	drives off.

	EXT DAY: CARLO'S STEPS (1955)

	MICHAEL and his party.  They watch.

	Then he turns and walks off, and they follow.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	INT NITE: MICHAEL'S LIMO EN ROUTE (1955)

	MICHAEL sits alone in the back of his car; NERI is driving.

	They do not speak for a long time; it is night--car lights
	flash by.

	NERI turns back.

				NERI
		You know I would never question
		anything you say.

				MICHAEL
			  (smiles)
		Speak your mind.

				NERI
		I'll do this for you; you know I
		should.

				MICHAEL
		No.  This I have to do.

	EXT NITE: PIZZA STREET (1955)

	MICHAEL's car pulls up in a quiet neighborhood, near an
	Italian Pizzeria.  NERI opens the door.

				MICHAEL
		Sit in the car.

	INT NITE: PIZZA PLACE (1955)

	He walks alone into the restaurant.  A MAN is tossing pizza
	dough in the air.

				MICHAEL
		Where's the boss?

				MAN
		In the back.  Hey Frank, someone
		wants you.

	A MAN comes out of the shadows, with a strong Italian accent.

				MAN
		What is it?

	He stops, frozen in fear.  It is FABRIZZIO.

	VIEW ON MICHAEL.  Gunfire from under his coat.  FABRIZZIO is
	cut down.  MICHAEL throws the gun down; turns and exits.

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL

	Several moving vans are parked in the Mall; one feels that
	these are the final days; the families are moving out; signs
	indicating that the property is for sale are evident.

	A black limousine pulls up, and before it has even stopped,
	the rear door flies open, and CONNIE attempts to run out,
	restrained by MAMA.  She manages to break free and runs
	across the Mall into Michael's house.

	INT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

	Inside the Corleone house.  Big boxes have been packed;
	furniture prepared for shipping.

				CONNIE
		Michael!

	She hurries into the living room, where she comes upon
	MICHAEL and KAY.

				KAY
			  (comforting)
		Connie...

	But CONNIE avoids her, and moves directly to MICHAEL.  NERI
	is watchful.

				CONNIE
		You lousy bastard; you killed my
		husband...

				KAY
		Connie...

				CONNIE
		You waited until our father died
		and nobody could stop you and you
		killed him, you killed him!  You
		blamed him about Sonny, you always
		did, everybody did.  But you never
		thought about me, never gave a damn
		about me.
			  (crying)
		What am I going to do now, what am
		I going to do.

	TWO of Michael's BODYGUARDS move closer, ready for orders
	from him.  But he stands there, waiting for his sister to
	finish.

				KAY
		Connie, how could you say such
		things?

				CONNIE
		Why do you think he kept Carlo on
		the Mall?  All the time he knew he
		was going to kill my husband.  But
		he didn't dare while my father was
		alive.  And then he stood Godfather
		to our child.  That coldhearted
		bastard.
			  (to KAY)
		And do you know how many men he had
		killed with Carlo?  Just read the
		papers.  That's your husband.

	She tries to spit into MICHAEL's face; but in her hysteria
	she has no saliva.

				MICHAEL
		Get her home and get a doctor.

	The TWO BODYGUARDS immediately take her arms and move her,
	gently but firmly.

	KAY is shocked; never taking her look of amazement from
	MICHAEL.  He feels her look.

				MICHAEL
		She's hysterical.

	But KAY won't let him avoid her eyes.

				KAY
		Michael, it's not true.  Please
		tell me.

				MICHAEL
		Don't ask me.

				KAY
		Tell me!

				MICHAEL
		All right, this one time I'll let
		you ask about my affairs, one last
		time.

				KAY
		Is it true?

	She looks directly into his eyes, he returns the look, so
	directly that we know he will tell the truth.

				MICHAEL
			  (after a very long pause)
		No.

	KAY is relieved; she throws her arms around him, and hugs
	him.  Then she kisses him.

				KAY
			  (through her tears)
		We both need a drink.

	INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (1955)

	She moves back into the kitchen and begins to prepare the
	drinks.  From her vantage point, as she smilingly makes the
	drinks, she sees CLEMENZA, NERI and ROCCO LAMPONE enter the
	house with their BODYGUARDS.

	She watches with curiosity, as MICHAEL stands to receive
	them.  He stands arrogantly at ease, weight resting on one
	foot slightly behind the other.  One hand on his hip, like a
	Roman Emperor.  The CAPOREGIMES stand before him.

	CLEMENZA takes MICHAEL's hand, kissing it.

				CLEMENZA
		Don Corleone...

	The smile fades from KAY's face, as she looks at what her
	husband has become.

	INT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	KAY wears a shawl over her hand.  She drops many coins in
	the coin box, and lifts a burning taper, and one by one, in
	a pattern known only to herself, lights thirty candles.

                                      Screenplay by

                                        Eric Roth

                                   Based on a novel by

                                      Winston Groom

                

               EXT. A SAVANNAH STREET - DAY (1981)

               A feather floats through the air. The falling feather.

               A city, Savannah, is revealed in the background. The feather 
               floats down toward the city below. The feather drops down 
               toward the street below, as people walk past and cars drive 
               by, and nearly lands on a man's shoulder.

               He walks across the street, causing the feather to be whisked 
               back on its journey. The feather floats above a stopped car. 
               The car drives off right as the feather floats down toward 
               the street.

               The feather floats under a passing car, then is sent flying 
               back up in the air. A MAN sits on a bus bench. The feather 
               floats above the ground and finally lands on the man's 
               mudsoaked shoe.

               The man reached down and picks up the feather. His name is 
               FORREST GUMP. He looks at the feather oddly, moves aside a 
               box of chocolates from an old suitcase, then opens the case.

               Inside the old suitcase are an assortment of clothes, a 
               pingpong paddle, toothpaste and other personal items.

               Forrest pulls out a book titled "Curious George," then places 
               the feather inside the book. Forrest closes the suitcase.

               Something in his eyes reveals that Forrest may not be all 
               there.

               Forrest looks right as the sound of an arriving bus is heard.

               A bus pulls up. Forrest remains on the bus bench as the bus 
               continues on.

               A BLACK WOMAN in a nurse's outfit steps up and sits down at 
               the bus bench next to Forrest. The nurse begins to read a 
               magazine as Forrest looks at her.

                                     FORREST
                         Hello. My name's Forrest Gump.

               He opens a box of chocolates and holds it out for the nurse.

                                     FORREST
                         You want a chocolate?

               The nurse shakes her head, a bit apprehensive about this 
               strange man next to her.

                                     FORREST
                         I could eat about a million and a 
                         half of these. My momma always said, 
                         "Life was like a box of chocolates.
                         You never know what you're gonna 
                         get."

               Forrest eats a chocolate as he looks down at the nurse's 
               shoes.

                                     FORREST
                         Those must be comfortable shoes. 
                         I'll bet you could walk all day in 
                         shoes like that and not feel a thing. 
                         I wish I had shoes like that.

                                     BLACK WOMAN
                         My feet hurt.

                                     FORREST
                         Momma always says there's an awful 
                         lot you could tell about a person by 
                         their shoes. Where they're going.
                         Where they've been.

               The black woman stares at Forrest as he looks down at his 
               own shoes.

                                     FORREST
                         I've worn lots of shoes. I bet if I 
                         think about it real hard I could 
                         remember my first pair of shoes.

               Forrest closes his eyes tightly.

                                     FORREST
                         Momma said they'd take my anywhere.

               INT. COUNTRY DOCTOR'S OFFICE - GREENBOW, ALABAMA - DAY 
               (1951)

               A little boy closes his eyes tightly. It is young Forrest as 
               he sits in a doctor's office.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She said they was my magic shoes.

               Forrest has been fitted with orthopedic shoes and metal leg 
               braces.

                                     DOCTOR
                         All right, Forrest, you can open 
                         your eyes now. Let's take a little 
                         walk around.

               The doctor sets Forrest down on its feet. Forrest walks around 
               stiffly. Forrest's mother, MRS. GUMP, watches him as he clanks 
               around the room awkwardly.

                                     DOCTOR
                         How do those feel? His legs are 
                         strong, Mrs. Gump. As strong as I've 
                         ever seen. But his back is as crooked 
                         as a politician.

               Forrest walks foreground past the doctor and Mrs. Gump.

                                     DOCTOR
                         But we're gonna straighten him right 
                         up now, won't we, Forrest?

               A loud thud is heard as, outside, Forrest falls.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Forrest!

               EXT. GREENBOW, ALABAMA

               Mrs. Gump and young Forrest walk across the street. Forrest 
               walks stiffly next to his mother.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now, when I was a baby, Momma named 
                         me after the great Civil War hero, 
                         General Nathan Bedford Forrest...

               EXT. RURAL ALABAMA

               A black and white photo of General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

               The photo turns into live action as the General dons a hooded 
               sheet over his head.

               The General is in full Ku Klux Klan garb, including his horse.

               The General rides off, followed by a large group of Klan 
               members dressed in full uniform.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She said we was related to him in 
                         some way. And, what he did was, he 
                         started up this club called the Ku 
                         Klux Klan. They'd all dress up in 
                         their robes and their bedsheets and 
                         act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks 
                         or something. They'd even put 
                         bedsheets on their horses and ride 
                         around. And anyway, that's how I got 
                         my name. Forrest Gump.

               EXT. GREENBOW

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk across the street.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Momma said that the Forrest part was 
                         to remind me that sometimes we all 
                         do things that, well, just don't 
                         make no sense.

               Forrest stops suddenly as his brace gets stuck. Forrest's 
               brace is caught in a gutter grate. Mrs. Gump bends down and 
               tries to free Forrest. Two old cronies sit in front of a 
               barber shop and watch.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Just wait, let me get it.

               Mrs. Gump struggles to pull the stuck brace from the grate.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Let me get it. Wait, get it this 
                         way. Hold on.

               Forrest pulls his foot out of the grate.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         All right.

               Mrs. Gump helps Forrest up onto the sidewalk. She looks up 
               and notices the two old man.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Oooh. All right. What are you all 
                         staring at? Haven't you ever seen a 
                         little boy with braces on his legs 
                         before?

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along the sidewalk past the two 
               old men. Mrs. Gump holds tightly onto Forrest's hand.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Don't ever let anybody tell you 
                         they're better than you, Forrest. If 
                         God intended everybody to be the 
                         same, he'd have given us all braces 
                         on our legs.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Momma always had a way of explaining 
                         things so I could understand them.

               EXT. OAK ALLEY/THE GUMP BOARDING HOUSE

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along a dirt road. A row of 
               mailboxes stands left.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         We lived about a quarter mile of 
                         Route 17, about a half mile from the 
                         town of Greenbow, Alabama. That's in 
                         the county of Greenbow. Our house 
                         had been in Momma's family since her 
                         grandpa's grandpa's grandpa had come 
                         across the ocean about a thousand 
                         years ago. Something like that.

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along the Gump Boarding House 
               driveway.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Since it was just me and Momma and 
                         we had all these empty rooms, Momma 
                         decided to let those rooms out. Mostly 
                         to people passing through. Like from, 
                         oh, Mobile, Montgomery, place like 
                         that. That's how me and Mommy got 
                         money. Mommy was a real smart lady.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Remember what I told you, Forrest.
                         You're no different than anybody 
                         else is.

               Mrs. Gump heads Forrest to the porch. She bends down to look 
               Forrest in the eye.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Did you hear what I said, Forrest?
                         You're the same as everybody else. 
                         You are no different.

               INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL / PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         Your boy's... different, Mrs. Gump.
                         Now, his I.Q. is seventy-five.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Well, we're all different, Mr.
                         Hancock.

               The principal sighs, then stands up.

               INT. HALLWAY

               Forrest sits outside the principal's office and waits.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She wanted me to have the finest 
                         education, so she took me to the 
                         Greenbow County Central School. I 
                         met the principal and all.

               The principal stands in front of Mrs. Gump. Forrest, sitting 
               left, listens.

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         I want to show you something, Mrs.
                         Gump. Now, this is normal.

               The principal holds up a chart with a designations according 
               to I.Q. and points to the center of the graph, labeled 
               "Normal." A red line below the normal area is labeled "State 
               Acceptance." The principal points to the section below the 
               acceptance line labeled "Below."

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         Forrest is right here. The state 
                         requires a minimum I.Q. of eighty to 
                         attend public school, Mrs. Gump.
                         He's gonna have to go to a special 
                         school. Now, he'll be just fine.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         What does normal mean, anyway? He 
                         might be a bit on the slow side, but 
                         my boy Forrest is going to get the 
                         same opportunities as everyone else.
                         He's not going to some special school 
                         to learn to how to re-tread tires. 
                         We're talking about five little points 
                         here. There must be something can be 
                         done.

               Forrest sits outside the principal's office.

                         We're a progressive school system.
                         We don't want to see anybody left 
                         behind.

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         He's on vacation.

               EXT. GUMP BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT

               Forrest sits on a swing outside the house. Loud organic male 
               grunts are heard coming from inside the house. Forrest sits 
               on the swing as the grunts continue. The principal steps out 
               of the Gump House and wipes the sweat from his face.

               Forrest is sitting on the porch.

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         Well, your momma sure does care about 
                         your schooling, son. Mm-mm-mm.

               The principal wipes the sweat from his neck, then looks back 
               at Forrest.

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         You don't say much, do you?

               Forrest grunts, imitating him. The principal, embarrassed, 
               turns and walks away.

               INT. GUMP BOARDING HOUSE/FORREST'S BEDROOM

               Mrs. Gump reads from the book "Curious George" as Forrest 
               sits on the bed and listens.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Finally, he had to try it. It looked 
                         easy, but, oh, what happened. First 
                         there...

                                     FORREST
                         Momma, what's vacation mean?

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Vacation?

                                     FORREST
                         Where Daddy went?

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Vacation's when you go somewhere, 
                         and you don't ever come back.

               Forrest lies down on his bed and looks up.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Anyway, I guess you could say me and 
                         Momma was on our own.

               EXT. GUMP BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               A cab driver closes the trunk of the car as two women walk 
               toward the house. A milkman steps down from the porch.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         But we didn't mind. Our house was 
                         never empty. There was always folks 
                         comin' and goin'.

                                     MRS. GUMP (V.O.)
                         Suppa.

               INT. GUMP BOARDING HOUSE

               Mrs. Gump steps forward and speaks to all the boarders.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         It's suppa, everyone. Forrest...

               A MAN WITH A CANE steps left across the hall.

                                     MAN WITH CANE
                         My, my. That sure looks special.

               Mrs. Gump looks into a sitting room and informs the boarders 
               about dinner.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Gentlemen, would you care to join us 
                         for supper? Hurry up and get it before 
                         the flies do. I prefer you don't 
                         smoke that cigar so close to mealtime.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Sometimes we had so many people 
                         stayin' with us that every room was 
                         filled with travelers. You know, 
                         folks livin' out of their suitcases, 
                         and hat cases, and sample cases.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Well, you go ahead and start. I can't 
                         find Forrest.

               Mrs. Gump walks up the stairs.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Forrest... Forrest...

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         One time a young man was staying 
                         with us, and he had him a guitar 
                         case.

               Mrs. Gump looks into Forrest's room. She hears singing coming 
               from another room and walks over to a closed door. Mrs. Gump 
               opens the door, revealing a young man with long sideburns as 
               he plays the guitar and sings. Forrest holds onto a broom 
               and dances oddly. The young man is ELVIS PRESLEY.

                                     ELVIS PRESLEY
                              (sings)
                         "Well, you ain't never caught a 
                         rabbit, and you ain't no friend of 
                         mine."

               Forrest's legs rock back and forth to the guitar.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Forrest! I told you not to bother 
                         this nice young man.

                                     ELVIS
                         Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am. I 
                         was just showin' him a thing or two 
                         on the guitar here.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         All right, but your supper's ready 
                         if y'all want to eat.

                                     ELVIS
                         Yeah, that sounds good. Thank you, 
                         ma'am.

               Mrs. Gump leaves and closes the door. Elvis sits back down.

               Forrest stands left, and looks himself in a mirror.

                                     ELVIS
                         Say, man, show me that crazy little 
                         walk you just did there. Slow it 
                         down some.

               Forrest begins to dance again as Elvis plays the guitar and 
               sings.

                                     ELVIS
                              (sings)
                         "You ain't nothin' but a hound, hound 
                         dog..."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I liked that guitar.

               Forrest dances as he watches himself in the mirror.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         It sounded good.

                                     ELVIS
                              (sings)
                         "...cryin' all the time"

               Forrest rocks up and down on his braced legs, then begins to 
               step.

                                     ELVIS
                              (sings)
                         "You ain't nothin' but a hound dog..."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I started moving around to the music, 
                         swinging my hips. This one night me 
                         and Momma...

               EXT. GREENBOW - NIGHT

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along a sidewalk. A television 
               inside a store window reveals Elvis Presley as he performs 
               "Houng Dog" on a stage.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...was out shoppin', and we walked 
                         right by Benson's Furniture and 
                         Appliance store, and guess what.

               The television reveals Elvis as he thrusts his hips and sings.

                                     ELVIS
                              (sings)
                         You ain't nothin' but a hound dog...

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest watch the television. Elvis dances 
               around in the same manner Forrest did. A woman in the audience 
               screaming and applauding.

                                     ELVIS
                              (sings)
                         You ain't nothin' but a hound dog...

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         This is not children's eyes.

               Mrs. Gump walks away, pulling Forrest with her. Forrest stops 
               and takes one last look. Elvis continues to perform over the 
               television.

                                     ELVIS
                              (sings)
                         "Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit 
                         and you ain't no friend of mine."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Some years later, that handsome young 
                         man who they called "The King," well, 
                         he sung too many songs, had himself 
                         a heart attack or something.

               EXT. SAVANNAH/BUS BENCH - DAY

               Forrest is still sitting on the bus bench. The black nurse 
               looks at him.

                                     FORREST
                         Must be hard being a king. You know, 
                         it's funny how you remember some 
                         things, but some things you can't.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD/ALABAMA - MORNING (1954)

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest wait for the school bus. The bus pulls 
               up as Mrs. Gump prepares Forrest for his first day of school.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         You do your very best now, Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         I sure will, Momma.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I remember the bus ride on the first 
                         day of school very well.

               The bus driver opens the door and looks down. Forrest walks 
               to the steps of the bus and looks at the bus driver. She is 
               smoking a cigarette.

                                     BUS DRIVER
                         Are you comin' along?

                                     FORREST
                         Momma said not to be taking rides 
                         from strangers.

                                     BUS DRIVER
                         This is the bus to school.

                                     FORREST
                         I'm Forrest Gump.

                                     BUS DRIVER
                         I'm Dorothy Harris.

                                     FORREST
                         Well, now we ain't strangers anymore.

               The bus driver smiles as Forrest steps up into the bus.

               INT. BUS

               Forrest steps up onto the bus. Mrs. Gump waves to Forrest as 
               the bus drives away. Forrest begins to walk down the aisle.

               TWO YOUNG BOYS look up from the seat.

                                     BOY #1
                         This seat's taken.

                                     BOY #2
                         It's taken!

               Forrest looks around. A larger girl slides over so Forrest 
               can't sit next to her. She shakes her head. Forrest looks to 
               the other side where a boy sits alone on a larger seat. They 
               boy glares up at Forrest.

                                     BOY #3
                         You can't sit here.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         You know, it's funny what a young 
                         man recollects. 'Cause I don't 
                         remember being born.

               EXT. SAVANNAH/BUS BENCH - DAY

               Forrest continues talking as he sits on the bus bench.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I, I... don't recall what I got for 
                         my first Christmas and I don't know 
                         when I went on my first outdoor 
                         picnic. But, I do remember the first 
                         time I heard the sweetiest voice...

               INT. BUS - MORNING (1954)

               Young Forrest is still standing in the aisle on the bus.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...in the wide world.

                                     GIRL
                         You can sit here if you want.

               Forrest looks back at JENNY CURRAN, a young girl about 
               Forrest's age.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I had never seen anything so beautiful 
                         in my life. She was like an angel.

                                     JENNY
                         Well, are you gonna sit down, or 
                         aren't ya?

               Forrest sits down next to Jenny.

                                     JENNY
                         What's wrong with your legs?

                                     FORREST
                         Um, nothing at all, thank you. My 
                         legs are just fine and dandy.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I just sat next to her on that bus 
                         and had conversation all the way to 
                         school.

                                     JENNY
                         Then why do you have those shoes on?

                                     FORREST
                         My momma said my back's crooked like 
                         a question mark. These are going to 
                         make me as straight as an arrow.
                         They're my magic shoes.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And next to Momma, no one ever talked 
                         to me or asked me questions.

                                     JENNY
                         Are you stupid or something.

                                     FORREST
                         Mommy says stupid is as stupid does.

               Jenny puts her hand out toward Forrest. Forrest reaches over 
               and shakes her hand.

                                     JENNY
                         I'm Jenny.

                                     FORREST
                         I'm Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         From that day on, we was always 
                         together. Jenny and me was like peas 
                         and carrots.

               EXT. OAK TREE - DAY

               Young Jenny and Forrest run toward a large oak tree.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She taught me how to climb...

               Jenny sits on a large branch and calls down to Forrest.

                                     JENNY
                         Come on, Forrest, you can do it.

               Forrest dangles from the branch.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...I showed her how to dangle.

               Jenny and Forrest sit on a tree branch and read.

                                     FORREST
                         "...a good little monkey and..."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She helped me to learn how to read.

               Forrest hangs upside down from a branch and swings back and 
               forth. Forrest's braces are wedged in the tree.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And I showed her to swing.

               EXT. OAK TREE - NIGHT

               The silhouete of the oak tree, Jenny and Forrest as they sit 
               on a branch.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Sometimes we'd just sit out and wait 
                         for the stars.

                                     FORREST
                         Momma's gonna worry about me.

               Jenny puts her hand on Forrest's hand.

                                     JENNY
                         Just stay a little longer.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         For some reason, Jenny didn't never 
                         want to go home.

                                     FORREST
                         Okay, Jenny. I'll stay.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She was my most special friend.

               INT. SAVANNAH/BUS STOP - DAY

               Forrest nods as he remembers.

                                     FORREST
                         My only friend.

               Forrest continues talking to the black woman. She doesn't 
               seem to be listening as she reads her magazine. She looks up 
               from her magazine.

                                     FORREST
                         Now, my Momma always told me that 
                         miracles happen every day. Some people 
                         don't think so, but they do.

               EXT. OAK ALLEY - ANOTHER DAY (1954)

               Jenny and Forrest walk. A dirt clod hits Forrest in the back 
               of the head. Jenny looks as Forrest rubs his head. THREE 
               YOUNG BOYS get off their bikes and pick up more rocks.

                                     BOY #1
                         Hey... dummy!

               Forrest is hit in the eye with another dirt clod. Forrest 
               falls backward onto the ground as the boys glare at him.

                                     BOY #2
                         Are you retarded, or just plain 
                         stupid?

                                     BOY #3
                         Look, I'm Forrest Gump.

               Jenny helps Forrest back up. Boy #1 and Boy #2 throw more 
               dirt clods at Forrest.

                                     JENNY
                         Just run away, Forrest.

               Another dirt clod hits Forrest in the arm.

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest!

               Forrest tries to run along the road, but his braces makes it 
               impossible. He hobbles along as Jenny yells after him.

                                     JENNY
                         Run away! Hurry!

               Boy #1 and Boy #2 turn back toward the bikes.

                                     BOY #2
                         Get the bikes!

                                     BOY #3
                         Hurry up!

               The boys pick up their bikes and ride after Forrest.

                                     BOY #3
                         Let's get him! Come on!

                                     BOY #2
                         Look out, dummy, here we come!

               The boys ride after Forrest. Jenny stands and watches.

                                     BOY #2
                         We're gonna get you!

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest! Run!

               Forrest hobbles along the dirt road.

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest!

               Forrest looks over his shoulder. The three boys race on their 
               bikes.

                                     BOY #1
                         Come back here, you!

               Forrest begins to run faster with his braces on. Forrest 
               continues running as the boys chase him. Blood drips down 
               from a cut on his head. The boys on the bikes are gaining on 
               Forrest. Forrest hobbles along. He begins to gain speed.

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest! Run!

               SLOW MOTION --

               Forrest runs from the chasing room. He looks over his shoulder 
               in fear.

               The boys on the bikes peddle faster as they gain on Forrest, 
               running.

               Forrest tries to run even faster to get away. Suddenly his 
               braces shatter, sending steel and plastic flying into the 
               air.

               Forrest runs and look down at his legs in surprise.

               Forrest continues to run faster as the metal braces and straps 
               fly off his legs.

               Forrest runs free of his braces and begins to pick up speed.

               The chasing boys ride over the remains of Forrest's braces.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now, you wouldn't believe it if I 
                         told you.

               EXT. SAVANNAH/ BUS BENCH - DAY

                                     FORREST
                         But I can run like the wind blows.

               The black woman continues to read her magazine. Forrest smiles 
               as he remembers.

                                     FORREST
                         From that day on, if I was going 
                         somewhere, I was running!

               EXT. OAK ALLEY - DAY (1954)

               Forrest sprints away from the boys. The boys stop the chase 
               and watch in disbelief. Forrest is already at the far end of 
               the road, clear of the chasing boys.

                                     BOY #2
                         He's gettin' away! Stop him!

               Boy #1 throws his bike down in frustration. Forrest runs 
               across a field.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD

               Forrest runs past a chain gang in their prison uniforms.

               They are cutting at the weeds on the side of the road.

               EXT. GREENBOW

               Forrest runs across the street. THE TWO OLD MEN sit in front 
               of the barber shop.

                                     OLD CRONY
                         That boy sure is a running fool.

               EXT. JENNY'S HOUSE

               Forrest runs down a driveway toward Jenny's small house.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now remember how I told you that 
                         Jenny never seemed to want to go 
                         home? Well, she lived in a house 
                         that was as old as Alabama. Her Momma 
                         had gone up to heaven when she was 
                         five and her daddy was some kind of 
                         a farmer.

               Forrest knocks on Jenny's door.

                                     FORREST
                         Jenny? Jenny?

               Forrest look around the field at the left. He notices Jenny 
               and runs toward her.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         He was a very lovin' man. He was 
                         always kissing and touchin' her and 
                         her sisters. And then this one time, 
                         Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to 
                         school.

               Forrest runs to Jenny.

                                     FORREST
                         Jenny, why didn't you come to school 
                         today?

                                     JENNY
                         Hsh! Daddy's takin' a nap.

               Jenny grabs Forrest's hand and runs into the field. Jenny's 
               DAD drunk, steps out onto the porch and shouts.

                                     JENNY'S DAD
                         Jenny!

                                     JENNY
                         Come on!

                                     JENNY'S DAD
                         Jenny, where'd you run to? You'd 
                         better come back here, girl!

               Jenny's dad steps out toward the field. Jenny leads Forrest 
               into the thick tobacco field. Jenny's dad runs through the 
               field searching for Jenny with a liquor bottle in his hand.

                                     JENNY'S DAD
                         Where you at?

               Jenny and Forrest run into a corn field as Jenny's dad tries 
               to chase her.

                                     JENNY'S DAD
                         Jenny! Jenny! Where you at? Jenny!

               Jenny drops to her knees and pulls Forrest down with her.

                                     JENNY
                         Pray with me, Forrest. Pray with me.

                                     JENNY'S DAD
                         Jenny!

                                     JENNY
                         Dear God, make me a bird so I can 
                         fly far, far, far away from here.
                         Dear God, make me a bird so I can 
                         fly far, far, far away from here.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Momma always said that God is 
                         mysterious.

                                     JENNY'S DAD
                         Jenny! Get back here!

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         He didn't turn Jenny into a bird 
                         that day. Instead...

               EXT. TRAILER PARK/ALABAMA - DAY (1955)

               A police officer escorts Jenny to her grandmother's trailer.

               Jenny's grandmother meets Jenny outside and leads her toward 
               the trailer.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...he had the police say Jenny didn't 
                         have to stay in that house no more.
                         She went to live with her grandma 
                         just over on Creekmore Avenue, which 
                         made me happy 'cause she was so close.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - NIGHT (1955)

               Jenny climbs over a second-floor railing and enters the house.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Some nights, Jenny'd sneak out and 
                         come over to my house, just 'cause 
                         she said she was scared. Scared of 
                         what, I don't know...

               INT. GUMP HOUSE/FORREST'S BEDROOM

               Jenny lies in bed next to young Forrest. She hugs him.

               Suddenly Forrest is hit in the back with a rock. Forrest and 
               Jenny turn around.

                                     OLDER BOY #1

                         Quit it!

               A teenage boy throws another rock as a pickup truck pulls up 
               behind him. Jenny turns and looks at Forrest.

                                     JENNY
                         Run, Forrest, run!

                         Run, Forrest!

               Forrest drops his books and runs down the road. The teenage 
               boy jumps into the back of the pickup truck with another boy 
               as the truck speeds after Forrest. Jenny steps left and gets 
               out of the way.

                                     OLDER BOY #2

                         Move it, jack rabbit!

               The truck follows right on Forrest's heels. A rebel flag 
               license plate adorns the truck's grill.

                                     OLDER BOY #1
                         Come on!

               Forrest runs along the road as the truck chases him. The 
               boys in the back of the truck pound on the roof as the truck 
               turns right, after Forrest. The truck drives into a field.

               Forrest runs toward a fence.

                                     BOY
                         Run! Faster! Yeah! Go! Go! Come on, 
                         Forrest! Yeah!

                         Run, Forrest!

               Forrest leaps over a five-foot fence as the boys try to catch 
               him.

               Forrest looks left as he continues telling his life story.

                                     FORREST
                         Now, it used to be, I ran to get 
                         where I was goin'. I never thought 
                         it would take me anywhere.

               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL/ROAD - DAY (1961)

               Forrest runs along the road in front of the high school. The 
               truck continues to chase him as the boys pound on the roof.

                                     OLDER BOY
                         Come on. Whoo-hoo!

               The truck speeds past Forrest as he turns from the road and 
               runs onto the high school football field. Forrest runs across 
               the field during a football scrimmage.

               In the stands watching the scrimmage is the legendary 
               University of Alabama football coach BEAR BRYANT, wearing 
               his trademark plaid hat.

               A group of assistant coaches sit around him, as well as the 
               high school football coach. The quarterback throws the ball 
               into the air.

               Forrest runs past the quarterback. The receiver catches the 
               ball. Forrest runs past the receiver as an opposing player 
               tackles the stunned receiver.

               The football coach stands, followed by the assistant coaches.

                                     FOOTBALL COACH
                         Who in the hell is that?

                         That there is Forrest Gump. Coach.
                         Just a local idiot.

               Forrest runs under the field goal post and through the end 
               zone.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And can you believe it? I got to go 
                         to college, too.

               EXT. UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA STADIUM - DAY (1962)

               The crowd roars with excitement as a football is kicked off.

               The football players run around on the field. The crowd of 
               cheering fans create a huge sign that reads: "GO."

               Forrest is in a University of Alabama football uniform. He 
               looks up into the cheering crowd as his teammate fields the 
               kickoff. The teammate runs over to Forrest and hands him the 
               ball.

                                     FOOTBALL COACH
                         Okay! Run!

               The football coach, the assistants, and Alabama players cheer 
               for Forrest.

                                     FOOTBALL COACH
                         Run, you stupid son-of-a-bitch! Run!

               Forrest runs across the field. He speeds past the defending 
               players. Forrest runs past the opposite players. The crowd 
               cheers wildly, holding up cards, making a large sign that 
               reads: "Go."

               They turn the cards over, creating the word: "ALABAMA." The 
               football coach runs along the sidelines as he yells.

                                     FOOTBALL COACH
                         You stupid son-of-a-bitch! Run! Go!
                         Run!

               Forrest cuts and runs toward the sidelines. Two opposing 
               players collide. The football coach, the assistants and the 
               players all motion for Forrest to run toward the end zone.

                                     FOOTBALL COACH
                         Run! Turn! Go!

               Forrest turns up the sidelines and runs toward the end zone.

               Some opposing players fall down. Forrest runs along the 
               sidelines. The opposing players try to catch him.

               Forrest runs into the end zone as an opposing player dives 
               at his feet. The referee holds up his arm, signaling a touch 
               down. The crowd cheers wildly.

               Forrest continues to run, smashing through the band members, 
               then all the way toward the team tunnel. The football coach 
               looks at an assistant coach.

                                     FOOTBALL COACH
                         He must be the stupidest son-of-a-
                         bitch alive. But he sure is fast!

                         Now, maybe it was just me but college 
                         was very confusing times.

                         We must have no violence today, or 
                         any other day, because these National

                         and prevented violence.

               An assistant coach looks at the television, then at the other 
               coaches.

                         Say, wasn't that Gump?

               The football coach and two assistant coaches look. Forrest 
               dries himself off with a towel as he steps from the showers.

               Forrest steps up to the coaches' area and grabs a clean towel.

               The coaches turn and stare at Forrest. Forrest gives them 
               one of his silly waves, then walks away.

                         A few years later, that angry little 
                         man at the schoolhouse door thought 
                         it would be a good idea, and ran for 
                         President.

               COLOR FOOTAGE - Governor Wallace mingles in a crowd. Gunshots 
               are fired, wounding him. Some men wrestle the shooter. Wallace 
               lies wounded on the ground.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         But, somebody thought that it wasn't.

               EXT. SAVANNAH/BUS BENCH - DAY (1981)

               Forrest sits on the bench as the black woman looks at him. A 
               WHITE WOMAN with a bay sits left.

                                     FORREST
                         But he didn't die.

               A bus pulls up to the bus stop. The BLACK WOMAN looks down 
               at her watch.

                                     BLACK WOMAN
                         My bus is here.

                                     FORREST
                         Is it the number 9?

                                     BLACK WOMAN
                         No, it's the number 4.

               The Black Woman gets up and steps over to the bus.

                                     FORREST
                         It was nice talkin' to you.

               The white woman sits closer to Forrest.

                                     WHITE WOMAN
                         I remember when that happened, when 
                         Wallace got shot. I was in college.

                                     FORREST
                         Did you go to a girls' college, or 
                         to a girls' and boys' together 
                         college?

                                     WHITE WOMAN
                         It was co-ed.

                                     FORREST
                         'Cause Jenny went to a college I 
                         couldn't go to. It was a college 
                         just for girls.

               EXT, GIRLS' COLLEGE/JENNY'S DORM - NIGHT (1963)

               Forrest sits outside Jenny's dorm in the rain.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         But, I'd go and visit her every chance 
                         I got.

               A car pulls up. A song is heard from the radio. Forrest, 
               holding a box of chocolates, looks at the car. The two people 
               inside the car begins to kiss and embrace each other. Jenny 
               is inside the car with a boy. She leans back against the 
               passenger side door as they struggle to get comfortable.

                                     JENNY
                         Ouch! That hurts.

               Forrest gets up and runs toward the car. He tries to look in 
               the window as he steps over to the driver's side door. He 
               opens the door and begins to punch the boy inside. Jenny 
               jump out of the car and runs over to Forrest.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest! Forrest! Forrest, stop it!
                         Stop it!

                                     BILLY
                         Jesus!

                                     JENNY
                         What are you doing?

                                     FORREST
                         He was hurtin' you.

               Jenny's date, named BILLY, gets out of the car angrily.

                                     BILLY
                         What the hell is going on here?

                                     JENNY
                         No, he's not!

                                     BILLY
                         Who is that? Who is that?

                                     JENNY
                         Get over there!

               Jenny turns and looks at Billy. He shoves Jenny's hands away 
               from him.

                                     JENNY
                         Billy, I'm sorry.

                                     BILLY
                         What in the hell, git, would you git 
                         away from me!

                                     JENNY
                         Don't... Wait a second!

                                     BILLY
                         Git, just git away from me!

                                     JENNY
                         Don't go! Billy, wait a second!

               Billy gets back into the car.

                                     JENNY
                         He doesn't know any better!

               Billy pulls away as Jenny steps toward Forrest.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, why'd you do that?

               Forrest holds out the box of chocolates.

                                     FORREST
                         I brought you some chocolates. I'm 
                         sorry. I'll go back to my college 
                         now.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, look at you! Come on. Come 
                         on.

               Jenny grabs Forrest hand and leads him toward the dorm.

               INT. JENNY'S DORM/HALLWAY

               Jenny and Forrest sneak to Jenny's door.

                                     FORREST
                         Is this your room?

                                     JENNY
                         Shh!

               Jenny unlocks the door and they step inside.

               INT. JENNY'S DORM ROOM

               Jenny pulls a robe off of her sleeping roommate's bed. Jenny 
               hands the robe to Forrest, sitting on Jenny's bed.

                                     JENNY
                         Do you ever dream, Forrest, about 
                         who you're gonna be?

                                     FORREST
                         Who I'm gonna be?

                                     JENNY
                         Yeah.

                                     FORREST
                         Aren't I going to be me?

                                     JENNY
                         Well, you'll always be you, just 
                         another kind of you. You know? I 
                         want to be famous.

               Jenny picks up a towel, then walks back toward Forrest. Jenny 
               dries the water from her hair.

                                     JENNY
                         I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.
                         I just want to be an empty stage 
                         with my guitar, my voice... just me.

               Jenny takes off her slip and sits on the bed next to him.

               She is only wearing her bra and panties. Forrest looks at 
               Jenny like he's never seen a woman in her underwear before.

                                     JENNY
                         And I want to reach people on a 
                         personal level. I want to be able to 
                         say things, just one-to-one.

               Forrest looks down at Jenny's breasts. Jenny realizes that 
               he is looking at her.

                                     JENNY
                         Have you ever been with a girl, 
                         Forrest?

                                     FORREST
                         I sit next to them in my home 
                         economics class all the time.

                         Northern Alabama. I'm Joel Dorn...

               Forrest looks at Jenny as she removes her bra. Forrest looks 
               away, a bit shamed. Jenny takes his hand and guides it up to 
               her breast.

                                     DJ

                         long so stay with us, get warm, get 
                         cozy, get under the covers to the 
                         cool sounds of WHHY.

               Forrest looks over at Jenny's breasts, the shudder as he has 
               an orgasm.

                                     FORREST
                         Ohh... Oh... I'm sorry. Sorry.

                                     JENNY
                         It's okay.

               Forrest breathes heavily. Jenny puts her bra back on.

                                     JENNY
                         It's all right.

               Jenny leans over and puts her head on Forrest's shoulder.

                                     JENNY
                         It's okay.

                                     FORREST
                         Oh, I'm dizzy.

               A song is coming over the radio. Jenny hugs Forrest.

                                     JENNY
                         I bet that never happened in home

                         No.

               Jenny laughs and kisses Forrest on the cheek. Forrest and 
               Jenny hug on the bed as Jenny's roommate pretends to be 
               asleep, but is listening, horrified, with her eyes open.

                                     FORREST
                         I think I ruined your roommate's 
                         bathrobe.

                                     JENNY
                         I don't care. I don't like her, 
                         anyway.

               Forrest runs across the field as the defending team chases 
               him. The crowd yells for Forrest. They flip a sign that reads: 
               "Go Forrest."

                                     CROWD
                         Run! Run! Run!

                         Run! Run! Run!

               Forrest runs into the end zone. The band members rush toward 
               Forrest with their hands up, signaling him to stop. The crowd 
               flips over cards, creating a sign that reads "STOP."

                                     CROWD
                         Stop!

               Forrest stops in the end zone as he hears the crowd yells.

               The band motions for Forrest to stop and stay in the end

               zone. A group of defending players fall over each other in 
               the end zone. Forrest looks as the crowd cheers wildly.

               INT. WHITE HOUSE RECEPTION AREA - DAY (1963)

               The All-American players mingle around the food table. Forrest 
               steps up to the table. A large spread of food and soda is on 
               the table.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now, the real good thing about meeting 
                         the President of the United States 
                         is the food.

               Forrest takes a bottle of Dr. Pepper from the buffet table.

               Numerous bottle of Dr. Pepper are displayed on the table. A 
               servant opens the bottle for him.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         They put you in this little room 
                         with just about anything you'd want 
                         to eat or drink. And since number 
                         one, I wasn't hungry, but thirsty...

               Forrest begins to guzzle the Dr. Pepper.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...and number two, they was free, I 
                         musta drank me about fifteen Dr. 
                         Peppers.

               Forrest sets down an empty Dr. Pepper bottle next to a large 
               number of other empty bottles. Forrest holds his stomach and 
               burps.

               Another player steps up to the President and shakes the

                         I gotta pee.

               photo from Marilyn Monroe and a photo of John with his brother 
               Bobby.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Sometime later, for no particular 
                         reason, somebody shot that nice young 
                         President when he was ridin' in his 
                         car.

                         And a few years after that...

               ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE - Robert Kennedy stands at a podium as people 
               around him applaud.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...somebody shot his little brother, 
                         too, only he was in a hotel kitchen.

               Forrest sits on the bench and shakes his head.

                                     FORREST
                         It must be hard being brothers. I 
                         wouldn't know.

               EXT. UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA - DAY - GRADUATION DAY (1966)

               Students in their caps and gowns step forward the podium to 
               receive their diplomas. Forrest's name is called. He steps 
               up and accepts his diploma.

                                     DEAN
                         Forrest Gump.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now can you believe it? After only 
                         five years of playing football, I 
                         got a college degree.

               The dean shakes Forrest's hand vigorously. Forrest looks out 
               into the crowd.

                                     DEAN
                         Congratulations, son.

               Mrs. Gump, sitting in the audience, cries.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Momma was proud.

               Forrest and Mrs. Gump have their picure taken in front of a 
               large statue. A military recruiter spots Forrest and steps 
               up to him.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Forrest, I'm so proud of you. Here, 
                         I'll hold this for you.

               Mrs. Gump takes the diploma from Forrest. The recruiter slaps 
               Forrest on the shoulder and hands him some military 
               literature.

                                     MILITARY RECRUITER
                         Congratulations, son. Have you given 
                         any thought to your future?

                                     FORREST
                         Thought?

               Forrest looks at a pamphlet with a photo of "Uncle Sam" and 
               the caption "EXCELLENT CAREERS FOR EXCELLENT YOUNG MAN. Apply 
               now at your local U.S. Army Recruiting Center."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Hello, I'm Forrest...

               INT. ARMY BUS - DAY (1966)

               Forrest steps onto the army bus. Rain pours outside as the 
               army bus driver yells at Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         ...Forrest Gump.

                                     ARMY BUS DRIVER
                         Nobody gives a hunk of shit who you 
                         are, fuzzball! You're not even a 
                         lowlife scum sucking maggot! Get 
                         your faggoty ass on the bus. You're 
                         in the Army now!

               Forrest is about to sit on the first available seat, but the 
               recruit sitting there refuses Forrest.

                                     RECRUIT #1
                         This seat's taken.

               Forrest tries to sit on the next seat, but the 2nd recruit 
               slides over, blocking him.

                                     RECRUIT #2
                         It's taken.

               Forrest steps forward, looking much like he did on his first 
               bus ride to school years ago.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         At first, it seemed like I made a 
                         mistake.

               A large black recruit with a strange look on his face, much 
               like Forrest's, looks up from his seat. His name is BUBBA.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...seeing how it was my induction 
                         day and I was already gettin' yelled 
                         at.

               Bubba moves his case over, making room for Forrest to sit 
               down.

                                     BUBBA
                         You can sit down... if you want to.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I didn't know who I might meet or 
                         what they might ask.

               Bubba hands Forrest a handkerchief.

                                     BUBBA
                         You ever been on a real shrimp boat?

                                     FORREST
                         No, but I been on a real big boat.

                                     BUBBA
                         I'm talkin' about a shrimp catchin' 
                         boat. I've been workin' on shrimp 
                         boats all my life. I started out my 
                         uncle's boat, that's my mother's 
                         brother, when I was about maybe nine.
                         I was just lookin' into buyin' a 
                         boat of my own and got drafted. My 
                         given name is Benjamin Buford Blue.

               Bubba and Forrest shake hands.

                                     BUBBA
                         People call me Bubba. Just like one 
                         of them redneck boys. Can you believe 
                         that?

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         So Bubba was from Bayou La Batre, 
                         Alabama, and his momma cooked shrimp.

               table in front of a wealthy white man.

                                     DRILL SERGEANT
                         Gump! What's your sole purpose in 
                         this Army?

                                     FORREST
                         To do whatever you tell me, Drill 
                         Sergeant!

                                     DRILL SERGEANT
                         Godamnit, Gump! You're a goddamned 
                         genius! That's the most outstanding 
                         answer I've ever heard. You must 
                         have a godamned I.Q. of a hundred 
                         and sixty! You are godamned gifted, 
                         Private Gump!

               The Drill Sergeant moves down the line to the next man.

                                     DRILL SERGEANT
                         Listen up, people...

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now, for some reason, I fit in the 
                         Army like one of them round pegs.
                         It's not really hard. You just make 
                         your bed real neat and remember to 
                         stand up straight.

                                     DRILL SERGEANT
                         That is one very intelligent 
                         individual! You lock your scuzzy 
                         bodies up behind that private and do 
                         exactly what he does and you will go 
                         far in this man's army!

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And always answer every question 
                         with "Yes, Drill Sergeant!"

                                     DRILL SERGEANT
                         Is that clear?

                                     FORREST & RECRUITS
                         Yes, Drill Sergeant!

               ANOTHER DAY

               The recruits are sitting at the base of their bunks assembling 
               their rifles. Bubba speaks to Forrest.

                                     BUBBA
                         What you do is you just drag your 
                         nets across the bottom. On a good 
                         day, you can catch over a hundred 
                         pounds of shrimp. If everything goes 
                         all right, two men shrimpin' ten 
                         hours, less what you spends on gas, 
                         you can...

               Forrest finishes assembling his rifle as the other recruits 
               are still working on theirs.

                                     FORREST
                         Done, Drill Sergeant!

                                     DRILL SERGEANT
                         Gump!

               The Drill Sergeant rushes up to Forrest.

                                     DRILL SERGEANT
                         Why did you put that weapon together 
                         so quickly, Gump?

                                     FORREST
                         You told me to, Drill Sergeant.

               The Drill Sergeant looks at his stop watch.

                                     DRILL SERGEANT
                         Jesus Christ! This is a new company 
                         record. If it wouldn't be a waste of 
                         such a damn fine enlisted man, I'd 
                         recommended you for O.C.S., Private 
                         Gump. You are gonna be a General 
                         some day, Gump! Now, disassemble 
                         your weapon and continue!

               The Drill Sergeant walks away as Forrest begins to disassemble 
               his rifle. After the Drill Sergeant walks past Bubba, Bubba 
               looks up at Forrest. Bubba continues talking about shrimp in 
               his slow southern drawl.

                                     BUBBA
                         Anyway, like I was sayin', shrimp is 
                         the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue 
                         it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute 
                         it. There, uh, shrimp kabobs, shrimp 
                         creole...

               ANOTHER DAY

               Bubba and Forrest shine their boots.

                                     BUBBA
                         ...shrimp gumbo, panfried, deep fried, 
                         stir fried. There's pineapple shrimp, 
                         lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper 
                         shrimp...

               ANOTHER DAY

               Bubba and Forrest are on their hands and knees as they scrub 
               the floor with toothbrushes.

                                     BUBBA
                         ...shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp 
                         salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp 
                         burger, shrimp sandwich... that's, 
                         that's about it.

               NIGHT

               Bubba lies in his bunk and looks up quietly.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Nighttime in the Army is a lovely 
                         time.

               Forrest lies in his bunk and looks up.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         We'd lay there in our bunks, and I'd 
                         miss my momma. And I'd miss Jenny.

               A young private tosses a Playboy magazine onto Forrest.

                                     YOUNG PRIVATE
                         Hey, Gump. Get a load of the tits on 
                         her!

               Forrest pick up the magazine and turns the page, revealing 
               Jenny as she poses with a school sweater on, and that's all.

               The pictorial is titled: "Girls of the South." Forrest looks 
               up with shock. He cranes his head up for a closer look.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Turns out, Jenny had gotten into 
                         some trouble over... some photos of 
                         her in her college sweater. And she 
                         was thrown out of school.

                                     SONG
                         "My baby does the hanky-panky..."

               INT. NASHVILLE/NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT (1966)

               Forrest, in his army uniform, steps into the foyer of the 
               club.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         But that wasn't a bad thing. Because 
                         a man who owns a theater in Memphis, 
                         Tennessee, saw those photo and offered 
                         Jenny a job singing in a show. The 
                         first chance I got, I took the bus 
                         up to Memphis to see her perform in 
                         that show.

               EMCEE steps out onto the stage.

                                     EMCEE
                         That was Amber, Amber Flame. Give 
                         her a big hand, guys. Good job, Amber.
                         And now, for your listening and 
                         viewing pleasure, direct from 
                         Hollywood, California, our very own 
                         beatnik beauty, let's give a big 
                         round of applause to the luscious 
                         Bobbie Dylan.

                                     CROWD
                         Bobbie... Bobbie...

               The emcee walks back off the stage and the curtain opens, 
               revealing Jenny as she sits on a stool on the stage. She 
               holds a guitar up and begins to play. She is topless.

                                     JENNY
                              (sings)
                         "Yes, and how many seas must the 
                         white dove said, before she sleeps 
                         in the sand."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Her dream had come true. She was a 
                         folk singer.

                                     JENNY
                              (sings)
                         "Yes, how many times must the 
                         cannonballs fly before they're forever

                                     MAN #1
                         You gotta lose the guitar, darling.

                                     MAN #2
                         Hey, come on, baby. Shake it up.
                         Shake it up now.

                                     MAN #3
                         Hey, somebody ought to get her a 
                         harmonica.

               The men laugh.

                              (sings)
                         "The answer, my friend is blowing in 
                         the wind. The answer is blowing in...

                         Yeah! Come on!

               Man #5 reaches up and tries to stick some money in Jenny's 
               shoe.

                                     MAN #5 :
                         Hey, honey, I got something here for 
                         you.

               Jenny kicks his hand. He yells angrily as he sits back down, 
               then tosses his drink on her.

                                     MAN #5
                         Goddamnit!

                                     JENNY
                         Hey! Hey! Stupid jerk! I'm singing a 
                         song here. Polly, get out here!

                                     MAN #

                                     JENNY
                         Shut up! Oh, shut up!

               Forrest walks up to Man #5 and grabs him and tosses him down 
               on the ground. Man #4 tries to grab Forrest, but Forrest 
               shoves him down too.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, what are you doing here? 
                         What are you doing?

               Forrest climbs up onto the stage and picks Jenny up, guitar 
               and all, and carries her.

                                     FORREST
                         Come on.

                                     JENNY
                         What are you doing? Forrest, let me 
                         down!

               Jenny struggles and frees herself from Forrest. Forrest steps 
               back in surprise. Jenny shoves the guitar at Forrest. Jenny 
               walks off as Forrest holds the guitar. He follows after her.

               EXT. MEMPHIS BRIDGE - NIGHT

               Forrest follows Jenny over a bridge outside the night club.

                                     JENNY
                         You can't keep doing this, Forrest.
                         You can't keep tryin' to rescue me 
                         all the time.

                                     FORREST
                         They was tryin' to grab you.

                                     JENNY
                         A lot of people try to grab me. Just --
                         you can't keep doing this all the 
                         time!

                                     FORREST
                         I can't help it. I love you.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, you don't know what love 
                         is.

               Jenny turns and looks over the bridge.

                                     JENNY
                         You remember that time we prayed, 
                         Forrest? We prayed for God to turn 
                         me into a bird so I could fly far, 
                         far away?

                                     FORREST
                         Yes, I do.

                                     JENNY
                         You think I can fly off this bridge?

                                     FORREST
                         What do you mean, Jenny?

                                     JENNY
                         Nothing.

               Jenny turns and looks at the light of an approaching vehicle.

               She steps into the street.

                                     JENNY
                         I gotta get outta here.

               Jenny runs and flags down the approaching vehicle.

                                     FORREST
                         But wait. Jenny!

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, you stay away from me, okay?
                         You just stay away from me, please.

               A pickup truck pulls over as Jenny looks at the driver.

                                     JENNY
                         Can I have a ride?

                                     DRIVER
                         Where you going?

                                     JENNY
                         I don't care.

                                     DRIVER
                         Get in the truck.

                                     FORREST
                         So bye-bye, Jenny. They sendin' me 
                         to Vietnam. It's this whole other 
                         country.

               Jenny walks toward Forrest. She looks at the driver.

                                     JENNY
                         Just hang on a minute.

               Jenny walks up to Forrest.

                                     JENNY
                         Listen, you promise me something, 
                         okay? Just if you're ever in trouble, 
                         don't try to be brave, you just run, 
                         okay? Just run away.

                                     FORREST
                         Okay. Jenny, I'll write you all the 
                         time.

               Jenny takes a last look at Forrest, then climbs into the 
               truck. Forrest watches Jenny in the pickup as it drives away.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And just like that.

               EXT. GREENBOW/GUMP BOARDING HOUSE/RIVER - DAY

               Forrest, dressed in his uniform, sits on a log and looks out 
               at a river.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...she was gone.

               Mrs. Gump walks toward Forrest and sits down next to him on 
               the log. Forrest leans down, placing his head on his mother's 
               shoulder.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         You come back safe to me, do ya hear?

               EXT. VIETNAM/MEKONG DELTA - MORNING (1967)

               The shadow of a helicopter over the rice field below. A 
               soldier is manning a gun from inside the helicopter. The 
               solider looks left, Forrest and Bubba ride in the helicopter.

               EXT. FIREBASE/4TH PLATOON

               The helicopter circles overhead, then lands at the firebase.

                                     SONG
                         "Some folks are born made to wave 
                         the flag. Ooh, they're red, white 
                         and blue. And when the band plays 
                         "Hail to the Chief," ohh, they point 
                         the cannon at you all. It ain't me.
                         It ain't me. I ain't no Senator's 
                         son, no. It ain't me. It ain't me..."

               Bubba and Forrest jump out of the helicopter with their gear/ 
               They walk and look around oddly.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now, they told us that Vietnam was 
                         gonna be very different from the 
                         United Sates of America.

               The soldier places a case of beer on a large stack of cases.

               He takes two beers out and walks away. In the background, 
               soldiers are barbecuing steaks and drinking beer.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Except for all the beer cans and the 
                         barbecue, it was.

                                     BUBBA
                         Y'know, I bet there's shrimp all in 
                         these waters. They tell me these 
                         Vietnams is good shrimp. You know, 
                         after we win this war, and we take 
                         over everything we can get American 
                         shrimpers to come on here and shrimp 
                         these waters. We'll just shrimp all 
                         the time, man. So much shrimp, why, 
                         you wouldn't believe it.

               Lieutenant DAN TAYLOR steps out of a tent. Shirtless, he 
               holds a roll of toilet paper in his hand.

                                     LT. DAN
                         You must be my F.N.G.'s.

                                     BUBBA AND FORREST
                         Morning', sir!

                                     LT. DAN
                         Ho! Get your hands down. Do not salute 
                         me. There are goddamned snipers all 
                         around this area who would love to 
                         grease an officer. I'm Lieutenant 
                         Dan Taylor. Welcome to Fourth Platoon.

               Lt. Dan looks at Bubba.

                                     LT. DAN
                         What's wrong with your lips?

                                     BUBBA
                         I was born with big gums, sir.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Yeah, well, you better tuck that in.
                         Gonna get that caught on a trip wire. 
                         Where you boys from in the world?

                                     BUBBA & FORREST
                         Alabama, sir!

                                     LT. DAN
                         You twins?

               Forrest and Bubba look at each other oddly, they don't get 
               the joke.

                                     FORREST
                         No, we are not relations, sir.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Look, it's pretty basic here.

               Lt. Dan starts to walk. Bubba and Forrest grab their gear 
               and follow him.

                                     LT. DAN
                         You stick with me, you learn from 
                         the guys who been in country awhile, 
                         you'll be right. There is one item 
                         of G.I. gear that can be the 
                         difference between a live grunt and 
                         a dead grunt.

               Lt. Dan stops and looks at the boys.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Socks, cushion, sole, O.D. green. 
                         Try and keep your feet dry when we're 
                         out humpin'. I want you boys to 
                         remember to change your socks wherever 
                         we stop. The Mekong will eat a grunt's 
                         feet right off his legs.

               Lt. Dan steps over to a large black soldier named SERGEANT 
               SIMS.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Sergeant Sims! Goddamnit, where is 
                         that sling-rope I told you to order.

                                     SGT. SIMS
                         I put in requisitions at Battalion.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Yeah, yeah, yeah, well you call those 
                         sonabitches again, call them again 
                         and again and again. I don't care 
                         how much it takes...

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Lt. Dan sure knew his stuff. I felt 
                         real lucky he was my lieutenant. He 
                         was from a long, great military 
                         tradition. Somebody in his family 
                         had fought and died in every single 
                         American war.

               EXT. VALLEY FORGE/THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR - DAY (1778)

               A distant relative of Lt. Dan's, wearing a revolutionary war 
               uniform, falls dead in the snow.

               EXT. GETTYSBURG/THE CIVIL WAR - DAY (1863)

               Another relative, wearing a civil war uniform and bearing a 
               striking resemblance to Lt. Dan, falls down dead.

               EXT. NORMANDY/WORLD WAR II - DAY (1944)

               Another relative, wearing a World War II, falls down dead on 
               the beach at Normandy.

               EXT. VETNAM/MEKONG DELTA/FIREBASE - DAY (1967)

                                     LT. DAN
                         Goddamnit, kick some ass!

                                     SGT. SIMS
                         I'm on it, Lieutenant.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Get on it!

               Lt. Dan steps back up to Bubba and Forrest.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I guess you could say he had a lot 
                         to live up to.

               Lt. Dan walks along the walkway and Bubba and Forrest follow.

                                     LT. DAN
                         So, you boys are from Arkansas, huh?
                         Well, I've been through there. Little 
                         Rock's a fine town. Now, go shake 
                         down your gear, see the platoon 
                         sergeant, draw what you need for the 
                         field.

               Lt. Dan steps inside the latrine, still holding the roll of 
               toilet paper.

                                     LT. DAN
                         If you boys are hungry, we got steaks 
                         burnin' right here.

               Lt. Dan sits down out of sight in the latrine, then stands 
               up, looking at the boys.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Two standing orders in this platoon.
                         One, take good care of your feet. 
                         Two, try not to do anything stupid, 
                         like gettin' yourself killed.

               Lt. Dan sits back down out of sight in the latrine. Bubba 
               and Forrest look at each other.

                                     FORREST
                         I sure hope I don't let him down.

               EXT. RICE FIELD - ANOTHER DAY

               Forrest, Bubba, and other soldiers in the Fourth Platoon 
               walk across the rice field. Some Vietnamese rice farmers are 
               working as the soldiers walk past.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I got to see a lot of countryside. 
                         We would take these real long walks.

               EXT. JUNGLE/DIRT ROAD - ANOTHER DAY

               Forrest's unit walks along a dirt road.

                                     SONG
                         And we were always lookin' for this 
                         guy named Charlie. I can't get no 
                         relief.

               Suddenly Lt. Dan holds up his fist, a signal for the unit to 
               stop. He motions for them to get down.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Hold it up!

                                     SGT. SIMS
                         Hold up, boys!

               Forrest gets down and looks around.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         It wasn't always fun. Lt. Dan always 
                         gettin' these funny feelings about a 
                         rock or a trail, or the road, so 
                         he'd tell you to get down, shut up!

                                     LT. DAN
                         Get down! Shut up!

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         So we did.

               Lt. Dan motions for the lead soldier to get down. Lt. Dan 
               crouches down. Lt. Dan looks at the soldiers and points to 
               his eyes. He lies down on the dirt road and crawls.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now, I don't know much about anything, 
                         but I think some of American's best 
                         young men served in this war. There 
                         was Dallas, from Phoenix. Cleveland, 
                         he was from Detroit.

                         hell's going on?

               Tex holds up his hand, motioning that he doesn't know.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And Tex was, well, I don't remember 
                         where Tex come from.

                         Ah, nothin'. Fourth Platoon, on your 
                         feet! Still got ten clicks to go to 
                         that river.

               Forrest stands up and begins to walk with the platoon.

                                     LT. DAN
                         All right, move out! Comin' out.

                         The good thing about Vietnam is there 
                         was always someplace to go.

               Lt. Dan walks away as Forrest rushes over, aims two pistols 
               in the hole, then climbs inside.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And there was always something to 
                         do.

               ANOTHER DAY - The platoon walks through a rice paddy, waits 
               deep in water. It begins to rain.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         One day it started raining, and it 
                         didn't quit for four months.

               EXT. JUNGLE

               The rain pours down on Forrest and Bubba as they sit in a 
               foxhole.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         We been through every kind of rain 
                         there is. Little bitty stingin' 
                         rain...

               ANOTHER DAY - The platoon walks through the jungle as rain 
               pours down on them.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...and big ol' fat rain.

               ANOTHER DAY - The platoon shelters themselves as they walk 
               through the wind and rain.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Rain that flew in sideways.

               ANOTHER DAY - Forrest and other soldiers walk chest-deep 
               through a river. The rain splatters back up from the river, 
               hitting the soldiers. Forrest holds his hand up to protect 
               his face.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And sometimes rain even seemed to 
                         come straight up from underneath.

               EXT. ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

               The rain pours down on the men of the platoon as they sit in 
               a camp. Bubba sits down next to Forrest.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Shoot, it even rained at night.

               Bubba leans his back up against Forrest's back.

                                     BUBBA
                         Hey Forrest...

                                     FORREST
                         Hey Bubba...

                                     BUBBA
                         I'm gonna lean up against you, you 
                         just lean right back against me.

                                     BUBBA
                         This way, we don't have to sleep 
                         with our heads in the mud. You know 
                         why we a good partnership, Forrest?
                         'Cause we be watchin' out for one 
                         another. Like brothers and stuff. 
                         Hey, Forrest, there's somethin' I've 
                         been thinkin' about. I got a very 
                         important question to ask you. How 
                         would you like to go into the 
                         shrimpin' business with me?

                                     FORREST
                         Okay.

                                     BUBBA
                         Man, I tell you what, I got it all 
                         figured out, too. So many pounds of 
                         shrimp to pay off the boat, so many 
                         pounds for gas, we can just live 
                         right on the boat. We ain't got to 
                         pay no rent. I'll be the captain; we 
                         can just work it together. Split 
                         everything right down the middle.
                         Man, I'm tellin' you, fifty-fifty. 
                         And, hey, Forrest, all the shrimp 
                         you can get.

                                     FORREST
                         That's a fine idea.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Bubba did have a fine idea.

               ANOTHER NIGHT - Some soldiers patrol the area. Forrest lies 
               in a pup tent and writes a litter as the rain pours down. He 
               uses his flashlight to see.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I even wrote Jenny and told her all 
                         about it. I sent her letters. Not 
                         every day, but almost. I told her 
                         what I was doin' and asked her what 
                         she was doing, and I told her how I 
                         thought about her always.

               EXT. JENNY'S GRANDMOTHER'S TRAILER - DAY

               Jenny steps out of the trailer with a backpack and a guitar.

               She hugs a hippie guy, then jumps into the back of a 
               Volkswagen bus with another guy.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And how I was looking forward to 
                         getting a letter from her just as 
                         soon as she had the time I'd always 
                         let her know that I was okay.

               EXT. VIETNAM - NIGHT

               Forrest writes a letter in his tent.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Then I'd sign each letter, "Love, 
                         Forrest Gump."

               EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

               The Fourth Platoon makes their way through the jungle and 
               rain.

                                     SONG

                         What it is ain't exactly clear. 
                         There's a man with a gun over there,

                         This one day, we was out walking, 
                         like always, and then, just like 
                         that, somebody turned off the rain 
                         and the sun come out.

               Forrest looks up as the sun suddenly appears. Forrest's 
               platoon is attacked. A bullet kills the soldier standing 
               next to Forrest. Bombs explode all around as the soldiers 
               scramble to the ground.

               Forrest crawls over a berm as bullets fly overhead and explode 
               all around him. Forrest rolls over and pulls his pack off 
               Lt. Dan lies next to Forrest.

               Two soldiers with a machine gun fire into the jungle. Lt.

               The machine gunner fires into the treeline. Another soldier 
               helps him with the ammunition. The machine gun jams.

               A rocket explodes on the machine gunner and the other soldier,

               The platoon gets up and runs toward the cover of the jungle.

               Rockets explode all around the field. Forrest runs into the 
               jungle. The soldiers run through the jungle as bullets explode 
               all around. A soldier is blown up by a rocket. A soldier

                         Bubba was my best good friend. I had 
                         to make sure he was okay.

               Rockets explode in the jungle. Forrest runs back into the

               Forrest stops and aims his weapon. He looks around, scared.

                         Bubba?

               Something moves. Forrest turns and looks, then rushes over.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And on my way back to find Bubba, 
                         well, there was this boy laying on 
                         the ground.

                                     FORREST
                         Tex!

               Tex lies on the ground, his face distorted with pain.

                                     FORREST
                         Okay.

               Forrest reaches down and picks up Tex from the ground. Forrest 
               pulls Tex up over his shoulder, then runs.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I couldn't just let him lay there 
                         all alone, scared the way he was, so 
                         I grabbed him up and run him out of 
                         there.

               Forrest carries Tex out of the jungle and into the clearing.

               He sets Tex down on the bank of a river, and runs back into 
               the jungle.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And every time I went back looking 
                         for Bubba, somebody else was saying, 
                         "Help me, Forrest. Help me."

               Forrest drops another wounded soldier down at the bank of 
               the river next to Tex, and then runs back toward the jungle.

               Forrest grabs the third wounded soldier up from the ground 
               and turns him over. It is DALLAS.

                                     DALLAS
                         Can't hear... Can't hear...

               Dallas is dropped off at the bank next to the other wounded 
               soldiers. Forrest turns to go back to the jungle.

                                     2ND WOUNDED SOLDIER
                         No sweat, man. Just lay back. You're 
                         gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I started to get scared that I might 
                         never find Bubba.

                         over.

               Forrest trips over something and falls to the ground. He 
               looks up to find two bloody legs. It is Lt. Dan, who is 
               wounded. He speaks into the radio.

                                     LT. DAN

                                     FORREST

                                     LT. DAN
                         I know he's dead! My whole goddamned 
                         platoon is wiped out!

                              (over radio)
                         Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6, how copy you 
                         this transmission? Over.

               Forrest tries to pick up Lt. Dan, who tries to push Forrest 
               away.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Goddammit! What are you doing? Leave 
                         me here! Get away. Just leave me 
                         here! Get out!

               Forrest pulls Lt. Dan over his shoulder and runs through the 
               jungle.

                                     STRONGARM
                         Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6. This is 
                         Strongarm, be advised, your fast 
                         movers are inbound at this time, 
                         over.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Then it felt like something just 
                         jumped up and bit me.

               Forrest falls down.

                                     FORREST
                         Ah, something bit me!

               Forrest gets up as Lt. Dan yells. Lt. Dan fires his pistol 
               at the unseen enemy as Forrest pulls him away.

                                     LT. DAN
                         You dink son-of-a-bitch! I can't 
                         leave the platoon! I told you to 
                         leave me there, Gump. Forget about 
                         me. Get yourself out! Did you hear 
                         what I said! Goddammit, pull me down!
                         Get your ass out of here!

               Forrest drops Lt. Dan down at the bank, next to the other 
               wounded soldiers. Lt. Dan grabs Forrest by the shirt, angry.

                                     LT. DAN
                         I didn't ask you to pull me out of 
                         there, goddamn you! What the hell do 
                         you think you're going?

                                     FORREST
                         To get Bubba.

                                     LT. DAN
                         I got an air strike inbound right 
                         now. They're gonna nape the whole 
                         area.

               Forrest gets up and runs as Lt. Dan yells after him.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Gump, you stay here, goddammit! That's 
                         an order!

                                     FORREST
                         I gotta find Bubba!

               Forrest runs through the jungle searching for Bubba. Forrest 
               slows down and looks around carefully.

                                     BUBBA
                         Forrest...

                                     FORREST
                         Bubba...

               Bubba looks up as he lies on the ground.

                                     BUBBA
                         I'm okay.

               Bubba holds a palm frond over his wound. Forrest removes the 
               frond to look at the wound. Bubba's chest has been blown 
               open.

                                     FORREST
                         Oh, Bubba, no...

                                     BUBBA
                         Naw, I'm gonna be all right.

               Forrest looks around as he hear the voices of the enemy.

                                     FORREST
                         Come on. Come on. Come here...

               Forrest carries Bubba through the jungle. The sound of 
               approaching planes fills the air.

                                     BUBBA
                         I'm okay, Forrest. I'm all right.

               The roar of approaching planes is deafening. Forrest looks 
               up in fear. Three planes dive down toward the jungle. They 
               fire napalm as the jungle explodes with massive fireballs.

               Forrest runs, carrying Bubba. The fireballs explode behind 
               him. The entire jungle area is in flames as Forrest runs.

               Forrest carries Bubba to the bank of the river. Lt. Dan and 
               the other wounded soldiers wait for a rescue helicopter.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Helo's inbound. Pop smoke, get it up 
                         there!

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         If I'd a known this was gonna be the 
                         last time me and Bubba was gonna 
                         talk, I'd a thought of something 
                         better to say.

               Forrest looks down at Bubba. A soldier releases a smoke 
               canister.

                                     FORREST
                         Hey, Bubba...

                                     BUBBA
                         Hey, Forrest. Forrest, why'd this 
                         happen?

                                     FORREST
                         You got shot.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Then Bubba said something I won't 
                         even forget.

                                     BUBBA
                         I wanna go home.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Bubba was my best good friend. And 
                         even I know that ain't something you 
                         can find just around the corner.
                         Bubba was gonna be a shrimpin' boat 
                         captain, but instead he died right 
                         there by that river in Vietnam.

               The helicopter fly overhead.

               BUS STATION - DAY

               Forrest continues with his life story. A MAN is sitting next 
               to Forrest on the bus bench.

                                     FORREST
                         That's all I have to say about that.

                                     MAN
                         It was a bullet, wasn't it?

                                     FORREST
                         A bullet?

                                     MAN
                         That jumped up and bit you.

                                     FORREST
                         Oh, yes sir. Bit me directly in the 
                         buttocks. They said it was a million 
                         dollar wound, but the Army must keep 
                         that money, 'cause I still ain't 
                         seen a nickel of that million dollars.
                         The only good thing about being 
                         wounded in the buttocks...

               FLASHBACK - INT. US. ARMY HOSPITAL/VIETNAM - DAY

               Forrest holds two ice cream cones in his hands as he is 
               wheeled on a rolling stretcher.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...is the ice cream. They gave me 
                         all the ice cream I could eat. And 
                         guess what. A good friend of mine 
                         was in the bed right next door.

               Forrest, lying on his stomach, is wheeled to his bed.

               Forrest's butt sticks up and is bandaged. Forrest looks at 
               Lt. Dan lying on the bed. Forrest holds out an ice cream 
               cone for Lt. Dan.

                                     FORREST
                         Lieutenant Dan, I got you some ice 
                         cream. Lieutenant Dan, ice cream.

               Lt. Dan, annoyed, takes the ice cream cone and drops it into 
               his bed pan. Forrest slides himself onto his bed. A NURSE 
               reaches toward Lt. Dan.

                                     MALE NURSE
                         It's time for your bath, Lieutenant.

               The male nurse places Lt. Dan's hands on a pull-up bar, then 
               picks up Lt. Dan, whose legs have been amputated.

                                     MALE NURSE
                         Harper...

               Another nurse wheels the rolling bed under Lt. Dan. The male 
               nurse sets Lt. Dan down on the rolling bed. Forrest looks up 
               at Lt. Dan as he is wheeled away. A soldier reads the names 
               from a pile of letters.

                                     SOLDIER

                                     FORREST
                         I'm Forrest Gump.

               The soldier hands Forrest a large pile of letters.

               "Undeliverable as addressed. No forwarding order on file."

               Jenny Curran Rural Route 2 Greenbow, Ala. 39902 Forrest looks 
               down at the pile of letters.

               INT. ARMY HOSPITAL/VIETNAM - DAY

               A group of wounded soldiers hang out in the hospital, 
               recuperating. Forrest sits and watches "Gomer Pyle" on the 
               television.

                                     SOLDIER

               Forrest turns the TV off and he is hit on the back of the 
               head by a ping-pong ball.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Good catch, Gump. You know how to 
                         play this?

               Forrest shakes his head.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Come on, let me show you. Here.

               The wounded ping-pong player hands Forrest a paddle. Forrest 
               and the wounded ping-pong player step toward the ping-pong 
               table.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Now the secret to this game is, no 
                         matter what happens, never, never 
                         take your eye off the ball.

               He holds the ball up and moves it back and forth. Forrest 
               keeps his eyes on the ball.

                                     SOLDIER
                         All right...

               The wounded ping-pong player tosses the ball down onto the 
               table. Forrest begins to hit the ball back to the other 
               player.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         For some reason, ping pong came very 
                         natural to me.

                                     SOLDIER
                         See, any idiot can play.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         So I started playing it all the time.

               Forrest hits ping-pong balls.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I played ping-pong even when I didn't 
                         have anyone to play ping-pong with.

               The balls at land in a bed pan positioned on a chair. A group 
               of wounded soldier sit and watch Forrest play with himself. 
               Forrest hits two balls at a time against the opposite side 
               of the table.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         The hospital's people said it made 
                         me look like a duck in water, whatever 
                         that means. Even Lieutenant Dan would 
                         come and watch me play.

               Lt. Dan stares out the window. Forrest lies in his bed asleep. 
               A hand reaches and grabs him.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I played ping-pong so much, I even 
                         played it in my sleep.

               Lt. Dan pulls Forrest to the floor, and holds Forrest down.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Now, you listen to me. We all have a 
                         destiny. Nothing just happens, it's 
                         all part of a plan. I should have 
                         died out there with my men! But now, 
                         I'm nothing but a goddamned cripple! 
                         A legless freak. Look! Look! Look at 
                         me! Do you see that? Do you know 
                         what it's like not to be able to use 
                         your legs?

                                     FORREST
                         Well... Yes, sir, I do.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Did you hear what I said? You cheated 
                         me. I had a destiny. I was supposed 
                         to die in the field! With honor! 
                         That was my destiny! And you cheated 
                         me out of it! You understand what 
                         I'm saying, Gump? This wasn't supposed 
                         to happen. Not to me. I had a destiny. 
                         I was Lieutenant Dan Tyler.

                                     FORREST
                         Yo-You're still Lieutenant Dan.

               Lt. Dan looks at Forrest, lets go of Forrest and rolls.

               Lt. Dan sits up as Forrest looks at him.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Look at me. What am I gonna do now?
                         What am I gonna do now?

               INT. REC ROOM/VIETNAM HOSPITAL - ANOTHER DAY

               Forrest plays ping-pong by himself. An OFFICER walks up to 
               him.

                                     OFFICER
                         P.F.C. Gump?

               Forrest immediately grabs the ball and places it down on the 
               table under its paddle. Stands at attention.

                                     FORREST
                         Yes, sir!

                                     OFFICER
                         As you were.

               The officer holds up an envelope.

                                     OFFICER
                         Son, you've been awarded the Medal 
                         of Honor.

               INT. VIETNAM HOSPITAL WARD

               Forrest steps up to Lt. Dan's bed.

                                     FORREST
                         Guess what, Lieutenant Dan, they 
                         want to give me a me...

               Forrest stops in mid-sentence as he looks down at the bed. A 
               heavily bandaged soldier with bloodstains lies there. Forrest 
               turns and look at the NURSE.

                                     FORREST
                         Ma'am, what'd they do with Lieutenant 
                         Dan?

                                     NURSE
                         They sent him home.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Two weeks later, I left Vietnam.

                         The ceremony was kicked off with a 
                         candid speech by the President 
                         regarding the need for further 
                         escalation of the war in Vietnam. 
                         President Johnson awarded four Medals

               The television reveals Forrest as he is awarded the Medal of 
               Honor by President Johnson.

                                     PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                         America owes you a debt of gratitude,

                         I understand you were wounded. Where 
                         were you hit?

                                     FORREST

                         Oh, that must be a sight.

               President Johnson leans and whispers into Forrest's ear.

                                     PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                         I'd kinda like to see that.

               President Johnson looks down and smiles. The three men in 
               the barber shop look up in disbelief. Mrs. Gump looks up in 
               shock.

                                     PRESIDENT JOHNSON
                         Goddamn, son.

               EXT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - DAY

               Forrest walks by the Lincoln Memorial. A fence surrounds the 
               Memorial, as well as armed military guards.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         After that, Momma went to the hotel 
                         to lay down, so I went out for a 
                         walk to see our national capital.

                                     ISABEL
                         Hilary, all right, I've got the vets, 
                         what do you want me to do with them?

                         What are you doing here so late?

               Forrest takes a photo of the memorial as a woman named Hilary 
               gathers together some veterans against the Vietnam War.

                                     HILARY
                         We've been waiting for you for half 
                         an hour, so just get them in a line, 
                         will you. Hey, hey, come on, pictures 
                         later. You look great. Oh come on,

                         let him in here.

               Hilary grabs Forrest and puts him in the line with the other 
               vets against the war.

                         It's a good thing Momma was resting, 
                         'cause the street was awful crowded 
                         with people looking at all the statues 
                         and monuments. And some of them people 
                         were loud and pushy.

               Hilary leads the line of vets toward the large anti-Vietnam 
               War rally.

               The group of vets walk as Forrest tries to take another 
               picture. A vet behind him pushes him along.

                         your help.

               Forrest walks in the line. A banner reads "Veterans against 
               the War in Vietnam."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)

               Hilary leads the vets through a crowd of people outside the

               the back of a stage.

               A man, wearing an American flag shirt, stands on the stage.

               He is anti-war activist ABBIE HOFFMAN.

                         There was this man, giving a little 
                         talk. And for some reason, he was

                         ...and he liked to say the "F" word.
                         A lot. "F" this and "F" that. And

                         ...he said "F" word, people, for 
                         some reason, well, they'd cheer.

                                     ABBIE HOFFMAN
                         ...these guys just told Lyndon Johnson 
                         where to stick this fucking war! 
                         Yeah!

               Forrest looks up at the cheering crowd. Abbie turns and 
               motions for Forrest to come up on the stage.

                         Come on, man. Come up here, man.

                                     HILARY
                         Come on. Come on. Yeah, you!

               Hilary pulls Forrest up onto the stage.

                                     HILARY
                         Come on, get up there. Come on. Move, 
                         move. Let's go! Let's go.

               The other vets follow Forrest pushes onto the stage and push 
               him toward the microphones.

                                     VET
                         Come on, go. You can do it. Just get 
                         up there. Go on. That's it.

               Thousands of cheering protesters stand around the Washington 
               Monument. Forrest looks at the crowd. Abbie Hoffmann steps 
               up to Forrest.

                                     ABBIE HOFFMAN
                         Tell us a little bit about the war, 
                         man.

                                     FORREST
                         The war in Vietnam?

                                     ABBIE HOFFMAN
                         The war in Viet-fucking-nam!

               Abbie raises his fist as the crowd cheers wildly.

                                     FORREST
                         Well...

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         There was only one thing I could say 
                         about the war in Vietnam.

                                     FORREST
                         ...there was only one thing I could 
                         say about the war in Vietnam.

               Forrest looks at the crowd as he speaks. A policeman looks 
               around as he sneaks over to the audio circuit board.

                                     FORREST
                         In Vietnam war...

               The policeman pulls the patch cords out of the audio board.

               Forrest's amplified voice becomes inaudible. Forrest continues 
               to speak into the microphone, even though no one can hear 
               what he is saying. Hilary looks over and notices the 
               policeman. Hilary rushes over toward the audio board, pushes 
               the policeman away and grabs his night stick. Another 
               protester grabs the policeman and pulls him away.

                                     POLICEMAN
                         Hey, what the hell are you doing?

                                     HILARY
                         I'll beat your head in, you goddamned 
                         oinker!

               Isabel, Hilary and another protester try to plug the tangled 
               mess of wires back into the audio board.

                                     ISABEL
                         Christ, what'd they do with this?

               Forrest continues to speak into the microphone. The crowd 
               grows restless.

                                     CROWD
                         We can't hear you! We can't hear 
                         anything!

                                     HILARY
                         This one! This one! Give me that!

               Hilary plugs in the right patch cord.

                                     HILARY
                         That's it.

                                     FORREST
                         ...and that's all I have to say about 
                         that.

               Forrest looks at the massive crowd. They are silent. Abbie 
               Hoffman steps over to Forrest and pats him on the shoulder.

                                     ABBIE HOFFMAN
                         That's so right on, man. You said it 
                         all. What's your name, man?

                                     FORREST
                         My name is Forrest Gump. Forrest 
                         Gump.

                                     ABBIE HOFFMAN
                         Forrest Gump!

               Abbie raises his fist into the air. Abbie steps away from 
               Forrest. The crowd cheers.

                                     CROWD
                         Forrest Gump!

                                     JENNY
                              (screaming)
                         Forrest! Forrest!

               Jenny wades out into the reflection pool and waves her hand 
               into the air. Forrest recognizes her.

                                     FORREST
                         Jenny!

               Forrest rushes off the stage as Jenny makes her way out into 
               the pool.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest!

               Forrest jumps down into the crowd and runs. Jenny smiles as 
               she tries to run through the water. The crowd parts as Forrest 
               runs into the pool. Jenny rushes toward him.

                                     JENNY
                         Hey! Hey!

               The massive crowd cheers for the embracing couple in the 
               pool.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         It was the happiest moment of my 
                         life.

               EXT. WASHINGTON MONUMENT/PROTESTER'S ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

               Forrest and Jenny walk past the protesters who are camping 
               out on the lawn.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Jenny and me were just peas and 
                         carrots again. She showed me around, 
                         and even introduced me...

               INT. BLACK PANTHER HEADQUARTERS/STOREFRONT, D.C. - NIGHT

               Forrest stands at an open window and looks at the White House.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...to some of her new friends.

               A Black Panther, named RUBEN, steps over and pulls the shades 
               down.

                                     RUBEN
                         Shut that blind, man. And get your 
                         white ass away from that window.
                         Don't you know we in war here?

               Another Black Panther named MASAI grabs Forrest and pats him 
               down.

                                     JENNY
                         Hey man, he's cool. He's cool. He's 
                         one of us. He's one of us.

                                     MASAI
                         Let me tell you about us.

                                     WESLEY
                         Where the hell have you been?

                                     JENNY
                         I ran into a friend.

                                     MASAI
                         Our purpose here is to protect our 
                         black leaders from the racial 
                         onslaught of the pig who wishes to 
                         brutalize our black leaders, rape 
                         our women, and destroy our black 
                         communists.

                                     BLACK PANTHER
                         Masai, phone. Talk to these guys.

                                     WESLEY
                         Who's the baby killer?

                                     JENNY
                         This is my good friend I told you 
                         about. This is Forrest Gump. Forrest, 
                         this is Wesley. Wesley and I live 
                         together in Berkeley, and he's the 
                         president of the Berkeley chapter of 
                         S.D.S.

                                     MASAI
                         Let me tell you something else.

                                     WESLEY
                         I want to talk to you.

                                     JENNY
                         Okay, but...

                                     WESLEY
                         No. Now! Goddammit!

                                     MASAI
                         We are here to offer protection and 
                         help for all of those who need our 
                         help, because we, the Black Panthers, 
                         are against the war in Vietnam. Yes, 
                         we are against any war where black 
                         soldiers are sent to the front line 
                         to die for a country that hates them.
                         Yes, we are against any war where 
                         black soldiers go to fight and come 
                         to be brutalized and killed in their 
                         own communities as they sleep in 
                         their beds at night. Yes, we are 
                         against all these racists and imperial 
                         dog acts.

                                     JENNY
                         You are a fucking asshole!

               Wesley hits Jenny across the face. Slow motion -- Jenny falls 
               back. Slow motion -- Forrest steps forward with rage.

               Slow motion -- Wesley turns and looks at Forrest. Forrest 
               tackles Wesley and slams him onto a table. Jenny turns and 
               looks as Masai pulls out a gun.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest! Quit it! Quit it! Forrest!
                         Stop it!

               Jenny rushes over to Forrest and pulls Forrest off Wesley.

                                     JENNY
                         Stop it!

               Jenny tries to help Wesley as he moans on the floor. Wesley 
               knocks Jenny's hand away. He gets up, holding his bloody 
               lip.

                                     WESLEY
                         Oh, God. I shouldn't have brought 
                         you here. I should have known it was 
                         just gonna be some bullshit hassle.

                                     FORREST
                         He should not be hitting you, Jenny.

                                     JENNY
                         Come on, Forrest.

               Jenny steps out the door as Forrest picks up his hat.

                                     FORREST
                         Sorry I had a fight in the middle of 
                         your Black Panther party.

               The group of Black Panthers glare at Forrest. Forrest turns 
               and walks out the room.

               EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

               Forrest and Jenny walk past the White House. Protesters hold 
               a candlelight vigil behind them.

                                     JENNY
                         He doesn't mean it when he does things 
                         like this. He doesn't.

                                     FORREST
                         I would never hurt you, Jenny.

                                     JENNY
                         I know you wouldn't, Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         I wanted to be your boyfriend.

               They walk in silence. Jenny touches Forrest's uniform.

                                     JENNY
                         That uniform is a trip, Forrest. You 
                         look handsome in it. You do.

                                     FORREST
                         You know what?

                                     JENNY
                         What?

                                     FORREST
                         I'm glad we were here together in 
                         our national capitol.

                                     JENNY
                         Me too, Forrest. I have so much to 
                         tell you, you won't believe what's 
                         been going on...

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         We walked around all night, Jenny 
                         and me, just talkin'.

               EXT. ROUTE 66 - FLASHBACK - DAY

               Jenny stands in the rain, hitchhiking. A car pulls over to 
               pick her up. Jenny and other other girls get into the car.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)

                         And how she'd discovered ways to

                         I was a very special night for the 
                         two of us. I didn't want it to end.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - EARLY MORNING

               Jenny carries a backpack as she prepares to board a bus back 
               to Berkeley.

                                     FORREST
                         I wish you wouldn't go, Jenny.

                         I have to, Forrest.

                         Jenny? Things got a little out of 
                         hand. It's just this war and that, 
                         that lyin' son-of-a-bitch Johnson. I 
                         would never hurt you. You know that.

                         You know what I think? I think you 
                         should go home to Greenbow. Alabama!

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, we have very different lives, 
                         you know.

               Forrest looks down at Jenny. He pulls his Medal of Honor 
               from around his neck.

                                     FORREST
                         I want you to have this.

               Forrest places the Medal of Honor in Jenny's hand. Jenny 
               looks up at him.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, I can't keep this.

                                     FORREST
                         I got it just by doing what you told 
                         me to do.

                                     JENNY
                         Why're you so good to me?

                                     FORREST

                         I'll always be your girl.

               Jenny and Forrest hug each other. Wesley waits for Jenny.

               Jenny turns and walks up to Wesley. They walk toward the 
               entrance of the bus. Forrest smiles as Jenny looks at her.

               Jenny climbs up into the bus. Wesley glares at Forrest.

               Forrest gives Wesley the "evil eye." Jenny through the near 
               window of the bus, knocks on the window. Forrest turns and 
               looks. Jenny waves to Forrest. Forrest looks up and smiles 
               sadly. Jenny gives Forrest the peace sign as the bus pulls 
               away. The sign on the back of the bus reads "Berkeley to 
               D.C." Forrest gives Jenny the peace sign.

                         And just like that, she was gone out 
                         of my life again.

                         That's one small step for man, one 
                         giant leap for mankind. The, uh, the 
                         surface is fine and powdery. I can, 
                         I can pick it up loosely.

               Forrest demonstrates a ping-pong to some wounded vets.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I thought I was going back to Vietnam, 
                         but instead, they decided the best 
                         way for me to fight communists was 
                         to play ping-pong. So I was in the 
                         Special Services, traveling around 
                         the country cheering up all them 
                         wounded veterans and showing them 
                         how to play...

                         ...ping-pong. I was so good that 
                         some years later...

               EXT. CHINA/PING-PONG TOURNAMENT - FLASHBACK - DAY

               Forrest plays ping-pong against a Chinese player. A large 
               mural of Mao Tse-tung hangs on the wall. A crowd of communist 
               leaders sit and watch.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...the Army decided I should be on 
                         the All-American Ping-Pong Team. We 
                         were the first Americans to visit 
                         the land of China in like a million 
                         years or something like that, and 
                         somebody said that world peace was 
                         in our hands. But all I did was play 
                         ping-pong. When I got home...

               Forrest makes his way onto the stage, shakes hands with Dick 
               Cavett.

                         You had quite a trip. Can you, uh, 
                         tell us, uh, what was China like?

               John Lennon lights a cigarette.

                         Well, in the land of China, people 
                         hardly got nothing at all.

                         Well, it's easy if you try, Dick.

               Forrest looks oddly at John Lennon.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Some years later, that nice young 
                         man from England was on his way home 
                         to see his little boy and was signing 
                         some autographs. For no particular 
                         reason at all, somebody shot him.

               EXT. STUDIO - LATER

               A guard lets Forrest out a side entrance door. Forrest steps,

               Forrest looks at Lt. Dan. He is a dirty with long hair.

               Lt. Dan's wheelchair begins to slide down the ramp and spins 
               around on the icy ground. Forrest looks down at Lt. Dan 
               crashes at the bottom of the ramp.

                         Lieutenant Dan said he was living in 
                         a hotel. And because he didn't have 
                         no legs, he spent most of his time 
                         exercising his arms.

               A taxi driver honks his horn as Forrest wheels Lt. Dan out 
               in front of the taxi.

               A taxi skids to a stop, almost hitting them as they cross 
               the street. The taxi honks at Lt. Dan. Lt. Dan slaps the

                         Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?

                                     FORREST
                         I didn't know I was supposed to be 
                         looking for him, sir.

               Lt. Dan chuckles, drinks the rest of a bottle of wine and 
               tosses it down. He looks at Forrest. He wheels himself over 
               to television and turns it off.

                                     LT. DAN
                         That's all these cripples, down at 
                         the V.A., that's all they ever talk 
                         about.

               Lt. Dan picks up another bottle of port wine, but it is empty. 
               He tosses it onto the floor.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Jesus this and Jesus that. Have I 
                         found Jesus? They even had a priest 
                         come and talk to me. He said God is 
                         listening, but I have to help myself.
                         Now, if I accept Jesus into my heart, 
                         I'll get to walk beside him in the 
                         Kingdom of Heaven.

               Lt. Dan tosses the empty liquor bottle down and picks another 
               bottle. He becomes enraged as he throws the bottle and looks 
               at Forrest.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Did you hear what I said? Walk beside 
                         him in the Kingdom of Heaven. Well, 
                         kiss my crippled ass. God is 
                         listening. What a crock of shit.

                                     FORREST
                         I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Huh? Ah, well, before you go, why 
                         don't you get your ass down to the 
                         corner and get us another bottle of 
                         wine.

                                     FORREST
                         Yes, sir.

               INT. TIMES SQUARE BAR - NIGHT

               A television shows DICK CLARK as he emcees the Times Square 
               New York Eve celebration.

                                     DICK CLARK
                         We are at approximately 45th Street 
                         in New York City at One Astor Plaza.
                         This is the site of the old Astor 
                         Hotel. Down below us, well over a 
                         hundred thousand people are milling 
                         about, cheering with horns and 
                         whistles and hats...

                                     LT. DAN
                         What the hell's in Bayou La Batre?

                                     FORREST
                         Shrimpin' boats.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Shrimpin' boats? Who gives a shit 
                         about shrimpin' boats?

                                     FORREST
                         I gotta buy me one of them shrimpin' 
                         boats as soon as I have some money.
                         I made me a promise to Bubba in 
                         Vietnam, that as soon as the war was 
                         over, we'd go in partners. He'd be 
                         the captain of the shrimpin' boat 
                         and I'd be his first mate. But now 
                         that he's dead, that means that I 
                         gotta be the captain.

                                     LT. DAN
                         A shrimp boat captain.

                                     FORREST
                         Yes, sir. A promise is a promise, 
                         Lieutenant Dan.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Now hear this! Private Gump here is 
                         gonna be a shrimp boat captain. Well, 
                         I tell you what, Gilligan, the day 
                         that you are a shrimp boat captain, 
                         I will come and be your first mate.

                                     FORREST
                         Okay.

                                     LT. DAN
                         If you're ever a shrimp boat captain, 
                         that's the day I'm an astronaut.

               Two sleazy women, named LENORE and CARLA, walk up to Lt. 
               Dan.

                                     LENORE
                         Danny, what are you complaining about?

                                     CARLA
                         What are you doing, huh?

                                     LENORE
                         Mr. Hot Wheels. Who's your friend?

                                     FORREST
                         My name is Forrest, Forrest Gump.

                                     LT. DAN
                         This is Cunning Carla, and Long-Limbs 
                         Lenore.

               Carla puts a "Happy New Year" crown on Lt. Dan's head. Lenore 
               fixes her makeup.

                                     CARLA
                         So where you been, baby-cakes, huh? 
                         Haven't seen you around lately. You 
                         know, you should have been here for 
                         Christmas 'cause Tommy bought a round 
                         on the house and gave everybody a 
                         turkey sandwich.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Well, well, I had, uh, company.

                                     LENORE
                         Hey, hey! We was, we was just there.
                         That's at Times Square.

               Lenore leans and speaks into Forrest's ear.

                                     LENORE
                         Don't you just love New Year's? You 
                         get to start all over.

                                     CARLA
                         Hey, Lenore.

                                     LENORE
                         Everybody gets a second chance.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         It's funny, but in the middle of all 
                         that fun, I began to think about 
                         Jenny.

                         ...pour here in Times Square. It's 
                         been off-and-on all night, but these 
                         people hang in there.

               Jenny fills her bag with her belongings.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Wondering how she was spending her 
                         New Year's night out in California.

               A man lies passed out on the bed. Jenny looks at her black 
               eye in a mirror, then leaves the apartment. The TV shows the 
               ball in Times Square.

                                     CROWD
                              (over television)

               INT. TIMES SQUARE BAR - NIGHT

               The ball is lowered, lighting up a sign that reads "1972."

                                     CROWD
                              (over television)
                         ...1! Happy New Year!

               The people in the bar cheer and kiss each other. They blow 
               horns and toss confetti into the air. Forrest looks around 
               as Carla and Lenore lean over and kiss him.

               INT. LT. DAN'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER

               Carla removes her top and sits on top of Dan in his 
               wheelchair. They kiss and play around. Forrest sits in a 
               chair. Lenore leaps on him and begins to kiss Forrest. She 
               reaches down to Forrest's crotch. Forrest stands up nervously, 
               causing Lenore to fall down on the floor. Lenore stands up, 
               angry.

                                     LENORE
                         What are you, stupid or something?
                         What's your problem? What's his 
                         problem? Did you lose your pecker in 
                         the war or something?

                         I said, is your friend stupid or 
                         something?

                                     LT. DAN
                         Hey! Don't call him stupid!

               Lt. Dan throws Carla back onto the bed.

                                     CARLA
                         Don't push me like that!

                                     LENORE

                         You shut up! Don't you ever call him 
                         stupid!

                                     CARLA
                         What's the matter, baby? Why you 
                         treating me like shit?

               Lt. Dan falls out of his wheelchair and lands down on the 
               floor. Carla and Lenore laugh as they leave the apartment.

                                     CARLA
                         You retard!

                         You loser! You freak!

               Forrest tries to help Lt. Dan. Lt. Dan pushes Forrest away.

                                     LT. DAN
                         No!

               Forrest steps back as Lt. Dan flips back over, then pulls 
               himself back up onto his wheelchair. He breathes heavily.

                                     FORREST
                         I'm sorry I ruined your New Year's 
                         Eve party, Lieutenant Dan. She tastes 
                         like cigarettes.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I guess Lieutenant Dan figured there's 
                         some things you just can't change. 
                         He didn't want to be called crippled, 
                         just like I didn't want to be called 
                         stupid.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Happy New Year.

               EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

               An ANCHORMAN reports in front of the White House.

                                     ANCHORMAN
                         The U.S. Ping-Pong Team met with 
                         President Nixon today at an Oval 
                         Office ceremony...

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And wouldn't you know it...

               PRESENT - BUS STOP

               Forrest looks at the fat man on the bus bench.

                                     FORREST
                         ...a few months later they invited 
                         me and the ping-pong team to visit 
                         the White House. So I went again.
                         And I met the President of the United 
                         States again.

               INT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

               A plaque, presented to Forrest, reads "Presented to Forrest 
               Gump, member of the United States table tennis team as player 
               of the year for 1971. President NIXON holds the plaque.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Only this time they didn't get us 
                         rooms in a real fancy hotel.

                                     PRESIDENT NIXON
                         So are you enjoying yourself in our 
                         national capital, young man?

                                     FORREST
                         Yes, sir.

                                     PRESIDENT NIXON
                         Well, where are you staying?

                                     FORREST
                         It's called the Hotel Ebbott.

                                     PRESIDENT NIXON
                         Oh, no, no, no, no. I know of a much 
                         nicer hotel. It's brand-new. Very 
                         modern. I'll have my people take 
                         care of it for you.

               INT. WATERGATE HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Forrest speaks on the phone.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Security, Frank Wills.

               Forrest steps over to a window. Flashlights are moving around 
               in an office across from Forrest's room.

                                     FORREST
                         Yeah, sir, you might want to send a 
                         maintenance man over to that office 
                         across the way. The lights are off, 
                         and they must be looking for the 
                         fuse box or something, 'cause them 
                         flashlights they're, they're keeping 
                         me awake.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Okay, sir. I'll check it out.

                                     FORREST
                         Thank you.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         No problem.

                                     FORREST
                         Good night.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Good night.

               Forrest hangs up the phone. The camera tilts down, revealing 
               the hotel stationary, which reads "The Watergate Hotel."

               INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

               President Nixon makes a resignation speech on TV.

                                     PRESIDENT NIXON
                              (over television)
                         Therefore, I shall resign the 
                         Presidency effective at noon tomorrow.

               The television cuts to a shot of President Nixon standing 
               outside Air Force One with his hands in the peace sign.

                                     PRESIDENT NIXON
                              (over television)
                         Vice President Ford will be sworn in 
                         as President at that hour in this 
                         office. As I recall the high hopes 
                         for America with which we began this 
                         second term, I feel a great sadness 
                         that I will not be here in this 
                         office...

               Forrest is playing ping-pong by himself at the gymnasium. An 
               officer steps up to him.

                                     OFFICER
                         Sergeant Gump!

                                     FORREST
                         Yes, sir!

                                     OFFICER
                         As you were. I have your discharge 
                         papers. Your service is up, son.

               The officer hands Forrest an envelope, then walks away.

                                     FORREST
                         Does this mean I can't play ping 
                         pong no more?

                                     OFFICER
                         For the Army it does.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And just like that, my service in 
                         the United States Army was over. So 
                         I went home.

               Forrest takes his paddle and runs out of the gymnasium.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - DAY

               Mrs. Gump walks out of the house and smiles. Forrest walks 
               up to the house, wearing his uniform.

                                     FORREST
                         I'm home, Momma.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         I know, I know.

               INT. GUMP HOUSE

               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk into the house.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Louise, he's here. He's here, 
                         everybody.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now, when I got home, I had no idea 
                         that Momma had had all sorts of 
                         visitors.

               In the house are stacks of ping-pong paddles and life-sized 
               cardboard cutouts of Forrest playing ping-pong. The name on 
               the ping-pong paddles boxes reads: "Gump-Mao table tennis."

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         We've had all sorts of visitors, 
                         Forrest. Everybody wants you to use 
                         their ping-pong stuff. One man even 
                         left a check for twenty-five thousand 
                         dollars if you'd be agreeable to 
                         saying you like using their paddle.

                                     FORREST
                         Oh, Momma. I only like using my own 
                         paddle. Hi, Miss Louise.

                                     LOUISE
                         Hey, Forrest.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         I know that. I know that. But it's 
                         twenty-five thousand dollars, Forrest.
                         I thought maybe you could hold it 
                         for a while, see if it grows on you. 
                         Oh, you look good, Forrest. You look 
                         real good.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         That Momma, she sure was right. It's 
                         funny how things work out.

               EXT. BAYOU LA BATRE/BUBBA'S MOM'S HOUSE - DAY

               Forrest walks up to a shack on the edge of the Bayou. A group 
               of black kids play in the front yard.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I didn't stay home for long, because 
                         I'd made a promise to Bubba. And I 
                         always try to keep my promise. So I 
                         went on down to Bayou La Batre to 
                         meet Bubba's family and make their 
                         introduction.

               Bubba's mother named MRS. BLUE and her other children look 
               at Forrest.

                                     MRS. BLUE
                         Are you crazy, or just plain stupid?

                                     FORREST
                         Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue.

                                     MRS. BLUE
                         I guess.

               EXT. BUBBA'S GRAVE - DAY

               Forrest steps over to Bubba's tombstone.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And of course, I paid my respect to 
                         Bubba himself.

                                     FORREST
                         Hey, Bubba, it's me, Forrest Gump. I 
                         remember everything you said, and I 
                         got it all figured out.

               Forrest pulls out notes from his pocket.

                                     FORREST
                         I'm taking the twenty-four thousand, 
                         five hundred and six-two dollars and 
                         forty-seven cents that I got...

               EXT. BAYOU - DAY

               Forrest walks across a yard where men are cleaning shrimp.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...well, that's left after a new 
                         hair cut and a new suit and I took 
                         Momma out to real fancy dinner and I 
                         bought a bus ticket and three Doctor 
                         Peppers.

               Forrest walks along a wooden pier. Forrest pays an old black 
               shrimper a large wad of cash.

                                     OLD SHRIMPER
                         Tell me something. Are you stupid or 
                         something?

                                     FORREST
                         Stupid is as stupid does, sir.

               EXT. BUBBA'S GRAVE

               Forrest stands at the grave.

                                     FORREST
                         Well, that's what's left after me 
                         saying, "When I was in China on the 
                         All-America Ping-Pong Team, I just
                         loved playing ping-pong with my Flex-
                         O-Ping-Pong Paddle." Which everybody 
                         knows it isn't true, but Momma says 
                         it's just a little white lie so it 
                         wouldn't hurt nobody. So, anyway, 
                         I'm putting all that on gas, ropes 
                         and new nets and a brand-new shrimpin' 
                         boat.

               EXT. BAYOU - DAY

               Forrest steers his shrimping boat. The boat is old and rusty.

               Forrest unleashes his nets as his catch of the day drops to 
               the deck. It is a bunch of garbage and shells. Forrest picks 
               up one shrimp.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now, Bubba had told me everything he 
                         knows about shrimpin', but you know 
                         what I found out? Shrimpin' is tough.

               EXT. DOCKS

               Forrest pulls a couple of shrimp out of a bucket.

                                     FORREST
                         I only caught five.

                                     OLD SHRIMPER
                         A couple of more, you can have 
                         yourself a cocktail.

               The old shrimper begins to walk away, then stops and looks 
               at Forrest.

                                     OLD SHRIMPER
                         Hey, you ever think about namin' 
                         this old boat?

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I'd never named a boat before, but 
                         there was only one I could think of.

               Forrest paints a name on the side of his boat. The name is 
               "Jenny."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         The most beautiful name in the wide 
                         world.

               INT. DISCO

               Disco lights flash and people dance. A guy asks a girl to 
               dance.

                                     GIRL
                         Okay.

               Jenny sits at a table with some other people. She is snorting 
               cocaine.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now, I hadn't heard from Jenny in a 
                         long while. But...

               EXT. BAYOU LA BATRE - DAY

               Forrest stands at the helm as the boat glides across the 
               water.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         But I thought about her a lot. And I 
                         hoped that whatever she was doing 
                         made her happy.

               INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Drug paraphernalia and a large wad of cash are spread out on 
               a table. A man drops a syringe on the table. He reaches over 
               and touches Jenny. She is pale with dark lines under her 
               eyes.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Jenny smears some lines of cocaine on a mirror. She looks at 
               herself in the mirror.

               EXT. BALCONY

               Jenny steps out onto the high-rise balcony. She steps up on 
               a table and stands on the edge of the balcony. A busy street 
               lies many stories below. Jenny looks down to the intersection 
               below.

               She slips over the edge, regains her balance, turns and looks 
               back at the intersection below, and begins to get down from 
               the edge.

               Jenny grabs a hold of the ledge and carefully climbs down.

               She sits down on a chair. Jenny rocks back and forth as she 
               cries. She looks up at the sky.

               EXT. BAYOU LA BATRE/FORREST'S BOAT - NIGHT

               The moon shines above in the sky. Forrest lies in a hammock 
               on his boat.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I thought about Jenny all the time.

               EXT. FORREST'S BOAT/BAYOU DOCK - DAY

               Forrest stands at the helm of his boat and slowly glides by 
               the docks. Forrest looks around and notices something and 
               bends down to get a clear view. Lt. Dan sits in his wheelchair 
               on the deck. Forrest looks at Lt. Dan. He smiles, surprised.

                                     FORREST
                         Hi!

               Forrest leaps off of his moving boat and into the water. The 
               boat continues as Forrest clumsily swims. Lt. Dan sits in 
               his wheelchair at the edge of the dock. Forrest flails his 
               arms as he swims up to the dock. Lt. Dan waits for Forrest, 
               smoking a cigar. Forrest climbs up a ladder onto the dock.

                                     FORREST
                         Lieutenant Dan, what are you doing 
                         here?

                                     LT. DAN
                         Well, I thought I'd try out my sea 
                         legs.

                                     FORREST
                         Well, you ain't got no legs, 
                         Lieutenant Dan.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Well, well, Captain Forrest Gump. I 
                         had to see this for myself. And I 
                         told you if you were ever a shrimp 
                         boat captain, that I'd be your first 
                         mate. Well, here I am. I am a man of 
                         my word.

                                     FORREST
                         Okay.

               Forrest shakes Lt. Dan's hand.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Yeah, but don't you be thinking that 
                         I'm gonna be calling you sir.

                                     FORREST
                         No, sir.

               Forrest's boat glides, crushing a dock. Forrest and Lt. Dan 
               look at it.

                                     FORREST
                         That's my boat.

               EXT. BAYOU LA BATRE WATERS - DAY

               Forrest's shrimping boat is alone on the gulf waters.

                                     LT. DAN
                         I have a feeling if we head the east, 
                         we'll find some shrimp. So, take a 
                         left. Take a left.

               Forrest looks up. Lt. Dan is sitting in the rigging.

                                     FORREST
                         Which way?

                                     LT. DAN
                         Over there! They're over there! Get, 
                         get on the wheel and take a left!

                                     FORREST
                         Okay.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Gump, what are you doing? Take a 
                         left! Left! That's where we're gonna 
                         find those shrimp, my boy! That's 
                         where we'll find 'em.

               Forrest empties the net. Their "catch" is debris that falls 
               to the deck.

                                     FORREST
                         Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Okay, so I was wrong.

                                     FORREST
                         Well, how we gonna find them?

                                     LT. DAN
                         Well, maybe you should just pray for 
                         shrimp.

               INT. SMALL CHURCH - DAY

               The all-black gospel choir sings and claps their hands.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         So I went to church every Sunday...

               Lt. Dan is sitting in his chair at the back of the church. 
               He takes swigs from a liquor bottle.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too.
                         Though I think he left the praying 
                         up to me.

               EXT. BOAT - ANOTHER DAY

               A catch of junk is dumped onto the deck. Lt. Dan lowers 
               himself from the rigging.

                                     FORREST
                         No shrimp.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Where the hell's this God of yours?

               The wind begins to blow strong.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that, 
                         'cause right then, God showed up.

               EXT. BOAT - NIGHT

               Water sprays on deck during a hurricane. Lt. Dan on the 
               rigging, shouts and shakes his fist as he is pelted by wind 
               and rain.

                                     LT. DAN
                         You'll never sink this boat!

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now me, I was scared. But Lieutenant 
                         Dan, he was mad.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Come on! You call this a storm?

               Forrest slides back and forth as he attempts to steer the 
               boat.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Blow, you son-of-a-bitch! Blow! It's 
                         time for a showdown! You and me. I'm 
                         right here. Come and get me! You'll 
                         never sink this boat!

                         storm.

               Forrest's boat comes down the river.

               Lt. Dan and Forrest empty their net. A huge catch of shrimp 
               falls onto the deck. Lt. Dan opens another big catch.

               Another catch drops open on top of yet another huge catch.

               Forrest and Lt. Dan smile.

               Forrest looks a little surprised. Lt. Dan smiles, then looks

               and jumps into the water.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         He never actually said so, but I 
                         think he made his peace with God.

               EXT. BOAT

               Forrest and Lt. Dan have dinner on the deck. The television 
               shows an assassination attempt on President Gerald Ford.

                         For the second time in seventeen 
                         days, President Ford escaped possible 
                         assassination today when a woman, 
                         Sarah Jane Moore, fired on him as he 
                         stepped out of a hotel in San

                         to call him back. He is indisposed

                         the President as he was...

               Forrest dives into the water as he reacts.

               EXT. ROAD/GUMP HOUSE - DAY

               Forrest carries a suitcase as he runs down the road. Forrest 
               runs past the row of mailboxes and turns into the drive.

               Louise and others are on the front porch.

                                     FORREST
                         Where's Momma?

                         She's upstairs.

               INT. GUMP HOUSE - WOMAN'S BED ROOM

               Forrest opens the door, the doctor stands next to Mrs. Gump 
               in bed.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Hi, Forrest.

                                     DOCTOR
                         I'll see you tomorrow.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Oh, all right.

               The doctor looks down at Forrest's legs.

                                     DOCTOR
                         We sure got you straightened out, 
                         didn't we, boy?

               The doctor leaves and closes the door. Forrest takes off his 
               hat and steps over to her.

                                     FORREST
                         What's the matter, Momma?

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         I'm dyin', Forrest. Come on in, sit 
                         down over here.

                                     FORREST
                         Why are you dyin', Momma?

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         It's my time. It's just my time. Oh, 
                         now, don't you be afraid, sweetheart.
                         Death is just a part of life. It's 
                         something we're all destined to do. 
                         I didn't know it, but I was destined 
                         to be your momma. I did the best I 
                         could.

                                     FORREST
                         You did good, Momma.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         Well, I happened to believe you make 
                         your own destiny. You have to do the 
                         best with what God gave you.

                                     FORREST
                         What's my destiny, Momma?

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         You're gonna have to figure that out 
                         for yourself. Life is a box of 
                         chocolates, Forrest. You never know 
                         what you're gonna get.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Momma always had a way of explaining 
                         things so I could understand them.

                                     MRS. GUMP
                         I will miss you, Forrest.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She had got the cancer and died on a 
                         Tuesday. I bought her a new hat with 
                         little flowers on it.

               EXT. BUS STOP - PRESENT

               The elderly woman and Forrest sit. The woman is crying and 
               wipes her eyes with a hankie.

                                     FORREST
                         And that's all I have to say about 
                         that.

               A bus stops. Forrest looks at the elderly woman.

                                     FORREST
                         Didn't you say you were waiting for 
                         the Number Seven bus?

                                     ELDERLY WOMAN
                         There'll be another one along shortly.

                                     FORREST
                         Now, because I had been a football 
                         star, and a war hero, and a national 
                         celebrity, and a shrimpin' boat 
                         captain, and a college graduate, the 
                         city of fathers of Greenbow, Alabama, 
                         decided to get together and offered 
                         me a fine job.

               EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

               Forrest rides a lawn tractor as he moves the football field 
               lawn.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         So, I never went back to work for 
                         Lieutenant Dan.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE MAILBOXES

               Forrest takes out a letter and opens it.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Though he did take care of my Bubba-
                         Gump money. He got me invested in 
                         some kind of fruit company. And so 
                         then I got a call from him saying we 
                         don't have to worry about money no 
                         more.

               EXT. BUS STOP

                                     FORREST
                         And I said, "That's good. One less 
                         thing."

               INT. CHURCH - DAY The choir and members are singing.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Now, Momma said there's only so much 
                         fortune a man really needs...

               EXT. CHURCH

               The sign reads: "Four Square Baptist Church." A new cross is 
               placed on the steeple. New furniture is taken inside.

                                     REVEREND
                         Praise the Lord.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...and the rest is just for showing 
                         off. So, I gave a whole bunch of it 
                         to the Four Square Gospel Church.

               EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

               The sign reads: "Gump Medical Center Bayou La Batre, Alabama."

               The ribbon-cutting ceremony.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And I gave a whole bunch to the Bayou 
                         La Batre Fishing Hospital.

               EXT. BUBBA'S MOM'S HOUSE

               A postman delivers a letter to Bubba's mom. She opens the 
               letter.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And even though Bubba was dead, and 
                         Lieutenant Dan said I was nuts. I 
                         gave Bubba's mommy Bubba's share.

               She is surrounded by her many children. She looks at the 
               check and faints.

               EXT. BUS STOP

                                     FORREST

               A door opens as a white woman serves Bubba's mom some shrimp.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         She didn't have to work in nobody's 
                         kitchen no more.

                                     MRS. BLUE
                         Smells wonderful!

               EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD

               Forrest rides the mower.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And 'cause I was godzillionaire and 
                         I liked doing it so much. I cut that 
                         grass for free.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE BALCONY - NIGHT

               Forrest looks down the road as he steps onto the porch.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         But at nighttime, when there was 
                         nothing to do and the house was all 
                         empty, I'd always think of Jenny.

               Jenny's image walks, then vanishes. Forrest looks away. He 
               turns and walks into the house.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - DAY

               Jenny walks across the lawn to Forrest.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And then, she was there.

                                     JENNY
                         Hello, Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         Hello, Jenny.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Jenny came back and stayed with me.

               INT. GUMP HOUSE

               Jenny lies asleep in bed.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Maybe it was because she had nowhere 
                         else to go. Or maybe it was because 
                         she was so tired, because she went 
                         to bed and slept and slept like she 
                         hadn't slept in years. It was 
                         wonderful having her home.

               EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               Forrest and Jenny walking.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Every day we'd take a walk, and I'd 
                         jabber on like a monkey in a tree.
                         And she'd listen about ping-pong and 
                         shrimpin' boats and Momma makin' a 
                         trip to heaven. I did all the talkin'. 
                         Jenny most of the time was real quiet.

                                     FORREST
                         ...big ol' gobs of rain and little 
                         bitty stinging rain and rain...

               Jenny's old house stands at the end of the dirt road. It 
               appears to be deserted. Jenny walks toward the house and 
               stops. She stares at the house. Forrest walks toward Jenny.

               Jenny suddenly heaves a rock angrily at the house. She throws 
               other things at the house.

                                     JENNY
                         How could you do this?

               She breaks a window. Jenny collapses to the ground and sobs.

               Forrest knees down next to her.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Sometimes I guess there just aren't 
                         enough rocks.

               EXT. OLD OAK TREE - DAY

               Jenny and Forrest sit on a limb together.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I never really knew why she came 
                         back, but I didn't care. It was like 
                         olden times. We was like peas and 
                         carrots again.

               INT. GUMP HOUSE - DAY

               Jenny sits by the vase of flowers and look out the window.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Every day I'd pick pretty flowers 
                         and put them in her room for her.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - DAY

               Forrest closes his eyes as he sits on the porch. Jenny places 
               a box of Nike running shoes in his lap.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And she gave me the best gift anyone 
                         could ever get in the wide world.

                                     JENNY
                         Okay, you can open your eyes.

                                     FORREST
                         New shoes.

                                     JENNY

               Through the windows, Forrest and Jenny are dancing as it 
               rains outside.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And she even showed me how to dance.
                         And, well, we was like family... 
                         Jenny and me.

               EXT. RIVER - NIGHT

               Jenny and Forrest sit on a log together and look at the river.

               Jenny places her arms around Forrest.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And it was the happiest time of my 
                         life.

               The fireworks explode in the sky.

               INT. GUMP'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               The Statue of Liberty is shown on the TV. Fireworks go off.

               Forrest and Jenny are watching the 4th of July celebration

                         earlier, the Statue of Liberty...

               Jenny stands up and kisses Forrest on the cheek.

                                     JENNY
                         I'm going to bed.

               Jenny turns off the TV and walks outside. Forrest stands as 
               he puts down his Dr. Pepper. Jenny walks toward the stairs.

                                     FORREST
                         Will you marry me? I'd make a good 
                         husband, Jenny.

                                     JENNY
                         You would, Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         But you won't marry me.

                                     JENNY
                         You don't want to marry me.

                                     FORREST
                         Why don't you love me, Jenny? I'm 
                         not a smart man, but I know what 
                         love is.

               Forrest turns and walks toward the door. Jenny turns and 
               walks up the stairs. Forrest stands outside.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - NIGHT

               The house stands in the rain.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - NIGHT

               Forrest lies in his bed as the door opens. Jenny gets into 
               bed next to Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         Jenny?

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, I do love you.

               Jenny and Forrest kiss. Jenny takes off her nightgown as 
               they make love.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - MORNING

               Jenny carries her purse and walks toward a waiting cab.

                                     CAB DRIVER
                         Where are you running off to?

                                     JENNY
                         I'm not running.

               INT. GUMP HOUSE

               The cab drives away as Forrest is asleep in his bed. The 
               Congressional Medal lies on a table by a ping-pong paddle.

               Forrest holds a glass of milk and wears his bathrobe. He 
               looks at the medal he had give to Jenny. Jenny's bed is made. 
               Forrest stands in the doorway looking at the room and bed 
               where Jenny had been.

               EXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY

               Forrest sit on a rocking chair with his running shoes on. He 
               is still, as if in a trance. He slowly puts on his Bubba-
               Gump cap. Forrest stands. He walks off the porch. He begins 
               to jog across the lawn. His speed increases as he runs farther 
               away. Forrest runs down the drive away from his house.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         That day, for no particular reason, 
                         I decided to go for a little run.

               Forrest runs to the end of the drive, then turns right and 
               runs down the highway.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         So I ran to the end of the road, and 
                         when I got there, I thought maybe 
                         I'd run to the end of town.

               INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY

               The three men sit as they watch the television. Forrest runs 
               through the main street of town.

                         of security agents.

               The sign reads "Entering Greenbow County."

                         ...I thought maybe I'd just run across 
                         Greenbow County. And I figured since 
                         I run this far, maybe I'd just run 
                         across the great...

               Forrest runs by a sign that reads "Mississippi welcomes you. 
               The Magnolia State."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...state of Alabama. And that's what

                         For no particular reason, I just 
                         kept on going. I ran clear to the 
                         ocean.

               EXT. SANTA MONICA - DAY

               The sign reads "Santa Monica yacht harbor sports fishing - 
               boating - cafes." Forrest runs under the sign and onto the 
               pier.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And when I got there, I figured since 
                         I'd gone this far, I might as well 
                         turn around, just keep on going.

               EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN

               Forrest runs to a pier at the Atlantic Ocean.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         When I got to another ocean, I figured 
                         since I've gone this far, I might as 
                         well just turn back, keep right on 
                         going.

               Forrest runs across the pier. A lighthouse stands at the end 
               of the pier.

                         When I got tired, I slept. When I

                         Yeah.

               EXT. HIGHWAY

               Forrest is running along the highway. Forrest runs down a 
               road between field of wheat. A Mountain river. Forrest runs 
               across a cobble-stone bridge. The Rocky Mountains are behind 
               him in distance. Forrest runs through some meadowland.

               Split rail fences line the road.

                         I'd think a lot about Momma and Bubba, 
                         and Lieutenant Dan, but most of all, 
                         I thought about Jenny. I thought 
                         about her a lot.

                         here's a guy that's got his act 
                         together. Here's somebody who's got 
                         it, all figured out. Here's somebody 
                         who has the answer. I'll follow you 
                         anywhere, Mr. Gump.

                         So, I got company.

               Forrest runs up a slope on a high mountain road. A group of 
               people are jogging behind him.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And after that I got more company.
                         And then...

               A large group jogs behind Forrest across the desert road.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...even more people joined in.
                         Somebody later told me...

               EXT. BUS STOP - PRESENT

                                     FORREST
                         ...it gave people hope. Now... Now, 
                         I don't know anything about that, 
                         but...

               Forrest and his followers job through a small town. A man 
               runs up and talks to Forrest.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Some of those people asked me if I 
                         could help them out.

                                     AGING HIPPIE
                         Hey, man, hey, listen. I was wondering 
                         if you might help me, huh? Listen, 
                         I'm in the bumper sticker business 
                         and I've been trying to think up a 
                         good slogan. And since you have been 
                         such a big inspiration to the people 
                         around here, I thought you might be 
                         able to help me jump into... Whoa!
                         Man, you just ran through a big pile 
                         of dogshit!

               The hippie jumps over the "dogshit" as he runs along Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         It happens.

                                     AGING HIPPIE
                         What, shit?

                                     FORREST
                         Sometimes.

               The hippie stops to ponder this profound thought.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And some years later I heard that 
                         fella did come up with a bumper 
                         sticker slogan...

               A bumper sticker reads "Shit Happens."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         ...and he make a lot of money off of 
                         it.

               The truck with the bumper sticker drives into an intersection.

               It collides with a car.

               EXT. TRUCK STOP

               Forrest runs, followed by his group, as a man runs up to 
               him.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Another time I was running along, 
                         somebody who had lost all his money 
                         in the T-shirt business, and he wanted 
                         to put my face on a T-shirt, but he 
                         couldn't draw that well and he didn't 
                         have a camera.

                                     WILD-EYED MAN
                         I think it would be really fortunate 
                         for me if I could get your name on 
                         these, oh, your face and name on 
                         these T-shirts. It would be wonderful.

               A truck splashes mud onto Forrest as it goes by. The man 
               hands Forrest a yellow T-shirt to use as a rag to wipe the 
               mud off.

                                     WILD-EYED MAN
                         Here, use this one. Nobody likes 
                         that color anyway.

               Forrest wipes his face on the towel and hands it back to the 
               man.

                                     FORREST
                         Have a nice day.

               The man looks at the T-shirt. He holds it up displaying the 
               "Happy Face."

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And some years later I found out 
                         that that man did come up with a 
                         idea for a T-shirt and he made a lot 
                         of money off of it.

               EXT. MONUMENT VALLEY

               Forrest runs with a group that follows behind him.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Anyway, like I was saying, I had a 
                         lot of company. My Momma always said 
                         you got to put the past behind you 
                         before you can move on. And I think 
                         that's what my running was all about.
                         I had run for three years, two months, 
                         fourteen days, and sixteen hours.

               Forrest stops running. The group stops behind him. Forrest 
               stands and looks as the group waits expectantly. Forrest 
               turns and look.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Quiet. Quiet, he's gonna say 
                         something.

                                     FORREST
                         I'm pretty tired. I think I'll go 
                         home now.

               Forrest walks toward the group. The group parts for Forrest 
               as he walks down the middle of the road.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Now what are we supposed to do?

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         And just like that, my running days 
                         was over. So, I went home to Alabama.

               A television shows President Reagan and his staff as they 
               react to gunshots in front of a limo.

                         Moments ago, at two twenty-five p.m., 
                         as President Reagan was leaving the 
                         Washington Hilton Hotel...

               INT. GUMP HOUSE - DAY

               Forrest sits eating a sandwich, watching the news of the 
               assassination attempt.

                                     NEWSCASTER
                         ...five or six gunshots were fired 
                         by an unknown would-be assassin. The 
                         President was shot in the chest and 
                         the assailant was immediately tackled 
                         by a half a dozen lawmen. As the 
                         Presidential...

                         I picked up the mail.

                                     FORREST
                         Oh, thank you, Miss, Miss Louise.

                         One day, out of the blue clear sky, 
                         I got a letter from Jenny...

               EXT. BUS STOP - PRESENT

               Forrest takes the letter out of his pocket.

                                     FORREST
                         ...wondering if I could come down to 
                         Savannah to see her, and that's what 
                         I'm doing here. She saw me on TV, 
                         running, I'm supposed to go on the 
                         Number Nine bus to Richmond Street 
                         and get off and go one block left to 
                         1-9-4-7 Henry Street, Apartment 4.

               The elderly woman looks at the letter.

                                     ELDERLY WOMAN
                         Why, you don't need to take a bus.
                         Henry Street is just five or six 
                         blocks down that way.

                                     FORREST
                         Down that way?

                         Down that way.

               Forrest hastily grabs his suitcase and letter as he stands.

                         It was nice talking' to you.

               Forrest runs, the elderly woman shouts from the bus stop 
               bench. A truck honks its horn as Forrest runs across the 
               street past the truck.

                                     ELDERLY WOMAN
                         I hope everything works out for you.

               INT. JENNY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Jenny opens the door.

                                     JENNY
                         Hey! Forrest! How you doing?

                         Oh, I was wondering about that.

               Jenny shuts the door. Forrest looks around.

                                     FORREST
                         Is this your house?

                                     JENNY
                         Yeah, it's messy right now. I just 
                         got off work.

                         It's nice. You got air conditioning.

               Forrest hands Jenny the box of chocolates.

                                     FORREST

                         I ate some.

               Jenny picks up a scrapbook and turns the pages.

                         Hey, I kept, I kept a scrapbook of 
                         your, of your clippings and

                         I ran a long way. For a long time.

                         There. Listen, Forrest. I don't know 
                         how to say this. Um, I just... I 
                         want to apologize for anything that 
                         I ever did to you, 'cause I was messed

                         No problem. Got to go, Jen. I'm double

               Lynn Marie closes the door and waves bye to Forrest.

                         Thanks. This is very good friend, 
                         Mr. Gump. Can you say hi to him?

                                     LITTLE BOY
                         Hello, Mr. Gump.

                                     FORREST
                         Hello.

                                     LITTLE BOY
                         Now, can I go watch TV now?

                                     JENNY
                         Yes, you can. Just keep it low.

               The little boy runs into other room and picks up TV remote 
               control.

                                     FORREST
                         You're a momma, Jenny.

                                     JENNY
                         I'm a momma. His name is Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         Like me.

                                     JENNY
                         I named him after his Daddy.

                                     FORREST
                         He got a daddy named Forrest, too?

                                     JENNY
                         You're his daddy, Forrest.

               Forrest continues to stare at Forrest Jr. Forrest then looks 
               frightened and starts to back away.

                                     JENNY
                         Hey, Forrest, look at me. Look at 
                         me, Forrest. There's nothing you 
                         need to do, okay? You didn't do 
                         anything wrong. Okay?

               Jenny turns and looks at Forrest Jr. in the other room.

                                     JENNY
                         Isn't he beautiful?

                                     FORREST
                         He's the most beautiful thing I've 
                         ever seen. But... is, is he smart, 
                         or is he...

                                     JENNY
                         He's very smart. He's one of the 
                         smartest in his class.

               Forrest breathes deep. He looks at Jenny, then at Forrest 
               Jr.

                                     JENNY
                         Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him.

               Forrest walks into the room and sits down next to Forrest 
               Jr. "Sesame Street" is on the TV.

                                     BERT
                         Oh, great.

                                     ERNIE
                         Hey, Bert, can you give me a hand?

                                     BERT
                         A hand? Well, yeah, what do you want, 
                         Ernie?

                                     FORREST
                         What are you watching.

                                     FORREST JR.
                         Bert and Ernie.

                                     ERNIE
                         Well, it's the first stage. Bert. 
                         It's planning to write a story, Bert. 
                         I have pencils right here to write 
                         with, Bert. Now, we got, uh, paper. 
                         I'll take that paper, Bert. See, we 
                         have the paper to write on.

               EXT. PARK - DAY

               Forrest and Jenny sit on a bench. Forrest Jr. swings behind 
               them.

                                     JENNY
                         Forrest, I'm sick.

                                     FORREST
                         What, do you have a cough due to 
                         cold?

                                     JENNY
                         I have some kind virus. And the 
                         doctors don't, they don't know what 
                         it is. And there isn't anything they 
                         can do about it.

                                     FORREST
                         You could come home with me. Jenny, 
                         you and little Forrest could come 
                         stay at my house in Greenbow. I'll 
                         take care of you if you're sick.

                                     JENNY
                         Would you marry me, Forrest?

                                     FORREST
                         Okay.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - DAY

               A group has gathered on the lawn for the wedding. Louise 
               walks up to Forrest.

                                     MINISTER
                         Please take your seats.

                                     LOUISE
                         Forrest, it's time to start.

               Jenny walks out of the house. Forrest walks over to greet 
               her. She wears a white dress. She walks up to Forrest and 
               adjusts his necktie.

                                     JENNY
                         Hi. Your tie.

               Lt. Dan is walking across the lawn. He uses a cane. A WOMAN 
               is walking next to him.

                                     FORREST
                         Lieutenant Dan? Lieutenant Dan!

                                     LT. DAN
                         Hello, Forrest.

               Jenny walks over to Forrest and Lt. Dan.

                                     FORREST
                         You got new legs. New legs!

                                     LT. DAN
                         Yeah, I got new legs.

               Lt. Dan lifts his pant leg to display his metal leg.

                                     LT. DAN
                         Custom-made titanium alloy. It's 
                         what they use on the space shuttle.

                                     FORREST
                         Magic legs.

                                     LT. DAN
                         This is my fiancee, Susan.

                                     FORREST
                         Lieutenant Dan!

               Susan shakes Forrest's hand.

                                     SUSAN
                         Hi, Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny.

                                     JENNY
                         Hey, it's nice to meet you, finally.

               Jenny steps forward and kisses Lt. Dan's cheek. The group is 
               seated as they watch Forrest and Jenny take vows on the front 
               lawn. Forrest Jr. stands next to Jenny.

                                     MINISTER
                         Do you, Forrest, take Jenny to be 
                         your wife? Do you, Jenny, take Forrest 
                         to be your husband? If so, I pronounce 
                         you man and wife.

               The wind blows fallen leaves across the ground. Jenny, 
               Forrest, and Forrest Jr. walk toward the house. They all 
               hold hands as they walk.

               INT. GUMP HOUSE - MORNING

               Forrest steps into Jenny's bedroom. He carries a tray with 
               breakfast on it. Forrest looks at Jenny as she sleeps.

               Slowly she wakes up and looks at Forrest.

                                     FORREST
                         Hey.

                                     JENNY
                         Hey.

               Forrest sets the tray down next to Jenny as she sits up in 
               bed. Forrest opens a window, then sits down next to the bed.

                                     JENNY
                         Hey, Forrest, were you scared in 
                         Vietnam?

                                     FORREST
                         Yes. Well, I, I don't know.

               EXT. VIETNAM - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

               Forrest looks up into the sky as the rain stops. Forrest 
               removes his helmet. The stars emerge from behind the clouds.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Sometimes it would stop raining long 
                         enough for the stars to come out. 
                         And then it was nice. It was like 
                         just before the sun goes to bed down 
                         on the bayou...

               EXT. BAYOU - FLASHBACK - SUNSET

               Forrest stands on his boat and looks at a deep orange and 
               red sunset.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         There was over a million sparkles on 
                         the water. Like that mountain lake.

               EXT. MOUNTAIN LAKE - FLASHBACK - DAY

               Forrest runs along a highway. A lake reflects the mountains 
               and the sky.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         It was so clear, Jenny. It looks 
                         like there were two skies, one on 
                         top of the other. And then in the 
                         desert, when the sun comes up...

               EXT. DESERT - FLASHBACK - SUNRISE

               Forrest runs along a desert highway. The morning light casts 
               an orange glow over the desert.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         I couldn't tell where heavens stopped 
                         and the earth began. It was so 
                         beautiful.

               INT. GUMP HOUSE - MORNING

               Forrest looks at Jenny. Jenny looks out the window.

                                     JENNY
                         I wish I could have been there with 
                         you.

                                     FORREST
                         You were.

               Jenny reaches over and takes Forrest's hand.

                                     JENNY
                         I love you.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         You died on a Saturday morning.

               EXT. JENNY'S GRAVE AT OLD OAK TREE - DAY

               Forrest stands under the old oak tree where Jenny has been 
               buried.

                                     FORREST
                         And I had you placed here under our 
                         tree.

               Jenny's grave marker. Forrest tries to hold back his tears.

                                     FORREST
                         And I had that house of your father's 
                         bulldozed to the ground.

               EXT. JENNY'S OLD HOUSE - DAY

               Forrest watches as Jenny's dad's house is knocked down by a 
               bulldozer.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         Momma...

               EXT. JENNY'S GRAVE

                                     FORREST
                         ...always said dyin' was a part of 
                         life.

               Jenny's grave marker reads: JENNY GUMP July 16, 1945 -- March 
               22, 1982 Beloved Mother, Wife and Friend

                                     FORREST
                         I sure wish it wasn't. Little Forrest, 
                         he's doing just fine.

               INT. GUMP HOUSE - NIGHT

               Forrest Jr. reads a book to Forrest sitting next to him.

                                     FORREST JR.

               EXT. JENNY'S GRAVE

               Forrest looks down as he sobs.

                                     FORREST
                         ...every day. I make sure he combs

                         day. Teaching him how to play ping 
                         pong.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE - NIGHT

               Forrest tries to teach Forrest Jr. how to play ping-pong.

                                     FORREST
                         Okay...

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         He's really good.

                                     FORREST
                         Forrest, you go.

               Forrest Jr. serves the ball, causing Forrest dive and miss 
               it.

               EXT. GUMP HOUSE/RIVER - DAY

               Forrest and Forrest Jr. sit on a log by the river and fish.

                                     FORREST (V.O.)
                         We fish a lot.

               EXT. JENNY'S GRAVE

               Forrest looks down at the grave marker.

                                     FORREST
                         And every night, we read a book.
                         He's so smart, Jenny. You'd be so 
                         proud of him. I am. He, uh, wrote a 
                         letter, and he says I can't read it. 
                         I'm not supposed to, so I'll just 
                         leave it here for you.

               Forrest places the letter down at the grave marker, next to 
               fresh flowers. The name on the envelope reads: "Mom." Forrest 
               steps back and looks down at the grave.

                                     FORREST
                         Jenny, I don't know if Momma was 
                         right or if, if it's Lieutenant Dan.
                         I don't know if we each have a 
                         destiny, or if we're all just floating 
                         around accidental-like on a breeze, 
                         but I, I think maybe it's both. Maybe 
                         both is happening at the same time. 
                         I miss you, Jenny. If there's anything 
                         you need, I won't be far away.

               As Forrest walks away, a flock of birds flies overhead and 
               lands in the tree. Forrest turns and watches.

               EXT. ROAD - MORNING

               Forrest walks with Forrest Jr. for the bus. The bus drives 
               toward them.

                                     FORREST
                         Here's your bus. Okay.

               Forrest pulls "Curious George" out of Forrest Jr.'s backpack.

                                     FORREST
                         Hey, I know this.

                                     FORREST JR.
                         I'm gonna show that for show-and-
                         tell because grandma used to read it 
                         to you.

               Forrest looks at the book. The feather from the beginning of 
               the movie drops out of the book, unnoticed.

                                     FORREST
                         My favorite book.

               The bus comes to a stop. The door opens.

                                     FORREST
                         Well...

               Forrest puts the book back into Forrest Jr.'s backpack and 
               hands it to him.

                                     FORREST
                         ...okay. Hey, there you go.

               Forrest Jr. walks toward the bus. Forrest stands up.

                                     FORREST
                         Hey, Forrest. Don't... I wanted to 
                         tell you I love you.

                                     FORREST JR.
                         I love you too, Daddy.

                                     FORREST
                         I'll be right here when you get back.

               Forrest Jr. looks into the bus and at the bus driver. It is 
               the same bus driver, only older now, who drove Forrest to 
               school when he was a young boy.

                                     SCHOOLD BUS DRIVER
                         You understand this is the bus to 
                         school now, don't you?

                                     FORREST JR.
                         Of course, and you're Dorothy Harris 
                         and I'm Forrest Gump.

               Forrest Jr. looks over and waves to his father. Forrest nods 
               approvingly.

               Forrest Jr. gets on the bus. The bus pulls away. Forrest 
               stands next to the mailbox.

               Forrest sits down. The camera cranes down, revealing the 
               feather as it lies at Forrest's feet.

               A gust of wind picks the feather up. The feather floats up 
               into the air.

               Forrest sits at the side of the road. The feather floats 
               higher into the air.

               The feather soars up into the sky and travels up and down, 
               then covers the camera lens.

                                         THE END

     SCREEN BLACK

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 People were always asking me, did I
                 know Tyler Durden.

     FADE IN:

     INT.  SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR OF HIGH RISE -- NIGHT

     TYLER has one arm around Jack's shoulder; the other hand
     holds a HANDGUN with the barrel lodged in JACK'S MOUTH.
     Tyler is sitting in Jack's lap.

     They are both sweating and disheveled, both around 30; Tyler
     is blond, handsome; and Jack, brunette, is appealing in a
     dry sort of way.  Tyler looks at his watch.

                             TYLER
                 One minute.
                       (looking out window)
                 This is the beginning.  We're at
                 ground zero.  Maybe you should say a
                 few words, to mark the occasion.

                             JACK
                 ... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 With a gun barrel between your teeth,
                 you only speak in vowels.

     Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.

                             JACK
                       (still distorted)
                 I can't think of anything.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 With my tongue, I can feel the
                 rifling in the barrel.  For a second,
                 I totally forgot about Tyler's whole
                 controlled demolition thing and I
                 wondered how clean this gun is.

     Tyler checks his watch.

                             TYLER
                 It's getting exciting now.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 That old saying, how you always hurt
                 the one you love, well, it works both
                 way.

     Jack turns so that he can see down -- 31 STORIES.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 We have front row seats for this
                 Theater of Mass Destruction.  The
                 Demolitions Committee of Project
                 Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns
                 of ten buildings with blasting
                 gelatin.  In two minutes, primary
                 charges will blow base charges, and
                 those buildings will be reduced to
                 smoldering rubble.  I know this
                 because Tyler knows this.

                             TYLER
                 Look what we've accomplised.
                       (checks watch)
                 Thirty seconds.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Somehow, I realize all of this -- the
                 gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is
                 really about Marla Singer.

     PULL BACK from Jack's face.  It's pressed against TWO LARGE
     BREASTS that belong to...BOB, 45, a moose of a man.  Jack is
     engulfed by Bob in an intense embrace.  Bob weeps openly.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Bob had bitch tits.

     PULL BACK to wide on...

     INT. CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

     Men are paired off, hugging, talking in emotional tones.
     Near the door, a SIGN on a stand: "REMAINING MEN TOGETHER."

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This was a support group for men with
                 testicular cancer.  The big moosie
                 slobbering all over me was Bob.

                             BOB
                 We're still men.

                             JACK
                 Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Six months ago, Bob's testicles were
                 removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He
                 developed bitch tits because his
                 testosterone was too high and his
                 body upped the estrogen.  That was
                 where my head fit -- into his huge,
                 sweating tits that hung enormous, the
                 way we think of God's as big.

                             BOB
                 They're gonna have to open my pec's
                 again to drain the fluid.

     Bob hugs tighter; then looks with empathy into Jack's eyes.

                             BOB
                 Okay.  You cry now.

     Jack looks at Bob.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Wait.  Back up.  Let me start earlier.

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Jack lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 For six months.  I could not sleep.

     INT. COPY ROOM - DAY

     Jack, sleepy, stands over a copy machine.  His Starbucks cup
     sits on the lid, moving back and forth as the machine copies.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 With insomnia, nothing is real.
                 Everything is far away.  Everything
                 is a copy of a copy of a copy.

     Other people make copies, all with Starbucks cups, sipping.
     Jack picks up his cup and his copies and leaves.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - SAME

     Jack, sipping, stares blankly at a Starbucks bag on the
     floor, full of newspapers and FAST FOOD GARBAGE.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 When deep space exploration ramps up,
                 it will be corporations that name
                 everything.  The IBM Stellar Sphere.
                 The Philip Morris Galaxy.  Planet
                 Starbucks.

     Jack looks up as a pudgy man, Jack's BOSS, enters, Starbucks
     cup in hand, and slides a stack of reports on Jack's desk.

                             BOSS
                 I'm going to need you out-of-town a
                 little more this week.  We've got
                 some "red-flags" to cover.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 It must've been Tuesday.  he was
                 wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.

                             JACK
                       (listless management speak)
                 You want me to de-prioritize my
                 current reports until you advise of
                 a status upgrade?

                             BOSS
                 You need to make these your primary
                 "action items."

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 He was full of pep.  Must've had his
                 grande latte enema.

                             BOSS
                 Here are your flight coupons.  Call
                 me from the road if there are any
                 snags.  Your itinerary...

     Jack hides a yawn, pretends to listen.

     INT. BATHROOM - JACK'S CONDO - NIGHT

     Jack sits on the toilet, CORDLESS PHONE to his ear, flips
     through an IKEA catalog.  There's a stack of old Playboy
     magazines and other catalogs nearby.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Like everyone else, I had become a
                 slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.

                             JACK
                       (into phone)
                 Yes.  I'd like to order the Erika
                 Pekkari slip covers.

     Jack drops the open catalog on the floor.

     MOVE IN ON CATALOG -- ON PHOTO of COFFEETABLE SET...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If I saw something like clever coffee
                 table sin the shape of a yin and
                 yang, I had to have it.

     PAN TO PHOTO of ARMCHAIR...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Like the Johanneshov armchair in the
                 Strinne green stripe pattern...

     INT. LIVING ROOM/DINING AREA/KITCHEN

     The armchair APPEARS.  PAN OVER next to armchair...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Or the Rislampa wire lamps of
                 environmentally-friendly unbleached
                 paper.

     The lamps APPEAR.  PAN OVER to wall...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Even the Vild hall clock of
                 galvanized steel, resting on the
                 Klipsk shelving unit.

     The clock APPEARS as the shelving unit APPEARS on the wall.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I would flip through catalogs and
                 wonder, "What kind of dining set
                 defines me as a person?"  We used to
                 read pornography.  Now it was the
                 Horchow Collection.

     A dining room set APPEARS.  Jack, the cordless phone still
     glued to his ear, walks INTO FRAME and continues.

                             JACK
                 No, I don't want Cobalt.  Oh, that
                 sounds nice.  Apricot.

     Jack opens a cabinet, takes out a plate.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I had it all.  Even the glass dishes
                 with tiny bubbles and imperfections,
                 proof they were crafted by the
                 honest, simple, hard-working
                 indigenous peoples of wherever.

     He rummages through the refrigerator.  It's practically
     empty.  Jack takes out a jar of mustard, opens it and uses
     a butter knife to eat it.

     INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack, eyes puffy, face pale, sits before an INTERN, who
     studies him with bemusement.

                             INTERN
                 No, you can't die of insomnia.

                             JACK
                 Maybe I died already.  Look at my
                 face.

                             INTERN
                 You need to lighten up.

                             JACK
                 Can't you give me something?

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red
                 Seconals.

                             INTERN
                       (overlapping w/ above)
                 You need healthy, natural sleep.
                 Chew valerian root and get some more
                 exercise.

     The Intern ushes Jack to the door.  They step into the...

     INT. HALLWAY

     The Intern walks away from Jack, picks up a chart.

                             JACK
                 I'm in pain.

                             INTERN
                       (facetious)
                 You want to see pain?  Swing by First
                 Methodist Tuesday nights.  See the
                 guys with testicular cancer.  That's
                 pain.

     The Intern moves into the other room.  Jack stares after him.

     EXT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHT

     Jack heads for the front door.

     INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

     Jack stares at a group of men, including Bob, who are all
     listening to a group member speak at a lectern.  The SPEAKER
     has pale skin and sunken eyes -- he's clearly dying.

                             SPEAKER
                 I... wanted three kids.  Two boys and
                 a girl.  Mindy wanted two girls and
                 one boy.  We never could agree on
                 anything.

     The Speaker cracks a sad smile.  Some men chuckle, happy to
     lighten the mood.

                             SPEAKER
                 Well, she had her first child a month
                 ago, a girl, with her new husband...
                 And, Thank God.  I'm glad for her,
                 because she deserves...

     The speaker breaks down, WEEPS UNCONTROLLABLY.

     Jack watches.  A couple of the men go up to the speaker,
     comforting him, leading him away.  A LEADER takes the stand.

                             LEADER
                 Everyone, let's thank Thomas for
                 sharing himself with us.

     Jack, uncomfortable, joins EVERYONE ELSE:

                             EVERYONE
                       (in unison)
                 Thank you, Thomas.

                             LEADER
                 I look around this room and I see a
                 lot of courage.  And it gives me
                 strength.  We give each other
                 strength.

     Jack looks around.  Many of the men are sniffling, sobbing.
     Jack squirms in his seat.

                             LEADER
                 It's time for the one-on-one.  Let's
                 follow Thomas's example and open
                 ourselves.

     Everyone gets out of their chairs and begins pairing-off.
     Jack stands, uncomfortable.

                             LEADER
                 Can everyone find a partner?

     Bob, his chin down on his chest, starts toward Jack,
     shuffling his feet.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The big moosie, his eyes already
                 shrink-wrapped in tears.  Knees
                 together, invisible steps.

     Bob takes Jack into an embrace.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You
                 know that chest expansion program you
                 see on TV?  That was his idea.

                             BOB
                 ...using steroids.  I was a juicer.
                 Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for
                 racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm
                 bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids
                 won't return my calls...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Strangers with this kind of honesty
                 make me go a big rubbery one.

     Bob breaks into sobbing, putting his head on Jack's shoulder
     and completely covering Jack's face.  After a long beat of
     crying, Bob raises up his head, looks at Jack's NAMETAG.

                             BOB
                 Go ahead, Cornelius.  You can cry.

     They look at each other.  Slowly, Jack's eyes grow wet.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Then... something happened.  I was
                 lost in oblivion -- dark and silent
                 and complete.

     Bob pulls Jack's head back into his chest.  Jack tightens
     his arms around Bob.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I found freedom.  Losing all hope was
                 freedom.

     Jack pulls away from Bob.  On Bob's chest, there's a WET
     MASK of Jack's face from how he looks weeping.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Babies don't sleep this well.

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Jack lies sound asleep.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I became addicted.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT

     Jack moves into a "group hug" of sickly people, men and
     women.  In view is a sign by the door "Free and Clear."

     INT. OFFICE BUILDING BASEMENT - NIGHT

     Jack stands with a weeping middle-aged WOMAN.  He begins to
     cry along with her.  A sign by the door: "Onward and Upward."

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If I didn't say anything, people
                 assumed the worst.  They cried
                 harder.  I cried harder.

     INT. PUBLIC BUILDING CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

     Everyone, including Jack, sits back in their seats, EYES
     CLOSED.  The Leader speaks into a microphone.

                             LEADER
                 Tonight, we're going to open the
                 green door -- the heart chakra...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host
                 to cancer or parasites; I was the
                 warm little center that the life of
                 this world crowded around.

                             LEADER
                 ...And you open the door and you
                 step inside.  We're inside our
                 hearts.  Now, imaging your pain as a
                 white ball of healing light.  That's
                 right, the pain itself is a ball of
                 healing light.

     Jack, eyes closed, is silent...

                             LEADER
                 It moves over your body, healing you.
                 Keep this going and step forward,
                 through the back door of the room.
                 Where does it lead?  To your cave.
                 Step forward into your cave.

     INT. CAVE - JACK'S IMAGINATION

     Jack walks along, moving through an ICE CAVERN...

                             LEADER'S VOICE
                 That's right.  You're going deeper
                 into your cave.  And you're going to
                 find your power animal...

     Jack comes upon a PENGUIN.  The penguin looks at him, cocks
     his head to signal Jack forward.

                             PENGUIN
                 Slide.

     The penguin jumps onto a patch of ICE and slides away.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Jack walks out a doorway, saying goodbye to people.  He
     walks down the sidewalk, shining with peace.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Every evening I died and every
                 evening I was born again.  Resurrected.

                                                      CUT BACK TO:

     INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - RESUMING

     Jack's still in an embrace with Bob.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Bob loved me because he thought my
                 testicles were removed too.  Being
                 there, my face against his tits,
                 ready to cry -- this was my vacation.

     MARLA SINGER enters.  She has short matte black hair and
     big, dark eyes like a character from japanese animation.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 And, she ruined everything.

     Marla looks around, raises a cigarette to her lips.

                             MARLA
                 This is cancer, right?

     Bob and Jack stare, dumbfounded.

     INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - LATER

     Everyone paired-off.  MOVE THROUGH ROOM... FIND JACK'S FACE
     as he stares... MOVE THROUGH ROOM... FIND MARLA'S FACE.
     She's drinking coffee, smoking a cigarette.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This ... chick ... Marla Singer ...
                 did not have testicular cancer.  She
                 was a liar.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT

     Marla sits with the group, smoking, listening intently while
     a member speaks.  Jack spies on her.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 She had no diseases at all.  I had
                 seen her at my melanoma Monday night
                 group ...

     INT. CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

     Marla sits at the end of a row, smoking.  All the faces down
     the row are turned toward her, incredulous...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 ... and at "Free and Clear," my blood
                 parasites group Thursdays.

     Jack leans out further than the others, scornful.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 -- And, again, at "Seize The Day," my
                 tuberculosis Friday night.

                                                      CUT BACK TO:

     INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT

     Jack watches... Marla's eyes are closed, her head on the
     shoulder of the MAN she's embraced by.  She opens her eyes,
     catching Jack's stare.  Jack looks away.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Marla -- the big tourist.  Her lie
                 reflected my lie.

     Marla rests her chin on the man's shoulder.  Tears roll down
     her cheeks.  She wipes at them.

     EXT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHT

     Marla walks out,  The support group's dispersing.  Jack
     exits amongst them.  He spots Marla walking away.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 And suddenly, I felt nothing.  I
                 couldn't cry.  So, once again, I
                 could not sleep.

     Jack stares after Marla for a long moment.  He walks away.

     INT. BEDROOM - LATER

     Jack, in underwear, is cross-legged on the floor, assembling
     IKEA furniture, CORDLESS PHONE shouldered to his ear.

                             JACK
                       (into phone)
                 No, I just can't believe that card is
                 declined -- Okay, okay, let me give
                 you a different card number.

     Jack gets his wallet off the floor, pulls out another card
     and, MOS over the following, he reads it into the phone.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Next group, after guided meditation,
                 after we open our chakras, when it's
                 time to hug, I'm going to grab that
                 little bitch, Marla Singer, pin her
                 arms against her sides and say...

     INT. MEETING ROOM - NIGHT - JACK'S IMAGINATION

     CLOSE ON JACK as he CLAMPS his arms around Marla.

                             JACK
                 Marla, you liar, you big tourist.  I
                 need this.  Get out.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     Jack, in pajamas, stares at Home Shopping Network on his TV.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 When you have insomnia, you're never
                 really asleep and you're never really
                 awake.  I hadn't slept in four days...

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT

     Jack walks in and joins the crowd, looking around.  People
     are chattering with each other.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 -- But, in here, in everyone, there's
                 the squint of a five-day headache.
                 Yet they forced themselves to be
                 positive.  They never said
                 "parasite;" they said "agent."  They
                 always talked about getting better.

                             LEADER
                 Okay, everyone.

     Everyone sits in chairs.  Jack catches sight of Marla.

                             LEADER
                 To open tonight's communion, Chloe
                 would like to say a few words.

     Taking the lectern is CHLOE, a pale, sickly girl whose skin
     stretches yellowish and tight over her bones.  She wears a
     head bondage.  She clears her throat.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Ahh, Chloe.  Chloe looked the way
                 Joni Mitchell's skeleton would look
                 if you made it smile and walk around
                 a party being extra nice to everyone.

                             CHLOE
                 Well, I'm still here -- but I don't
                 know for how long.  That's as much
                 certainty as anyone can give me.  but
                 I've got some good news -- I no
                 longer have any fear of death.

     APPLAUSE from around the room.

                             CHLOE
                 But... I am in a pretty lonely place.
                 No one will have sex with me.  I'm so
                 close to the end and all I want is to
                 get laid for the last time.  I have
                 pornographic movies in my apartment,
                 and lubricants and amyl nitrate ...

     The LEADER gingerly takes control of the microphone.

                             LEADER
                 Thank you, Chloe.  Everyone, let's
                 thank Chloe.

                             EVERYONE
                 Thank you, Chloe.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - LATER

                             LEADER
                 Now, you're standing at the entrance
                 to your cave.  You step inside your
                 cave and you walk.  Keep walking.

     Jack's face, eyes closed, is motionless.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If I did have a tumor, I'd name it
                 Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on
                 the roof of your mouth that would
                 heal if only you could stop tonguing
                 it, but you can't.

                             LEADER
                 Now, find your power animal.

     INT. CAVE - JACK'S IMAGINATION

     Jack finds Marla smoking a cigarette.  Marla cocks her head,
     indicating whe wants him to --

                             MARLA
                 Slide.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - RESUMING

     Jack's eyes open and turn to Marla, watching her blow smoke
     rings with her eyes closed.

     INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - LATER

     Everyone stands and mills about, pairing-off.

                             LEADER
                 Pick someone special to you tonight.

     Jack sees the ghastly spectre of Chloe ambling towards him.
     He tries to smile.  She smiles with a twisted, dying mouth.

                             CHLOE
                 Hello, Mr. Tayler.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I never gave my real name at support
                 groups.

                             JACK
                 Hi, Chloe.

                             CHLOE
                 We've never actually talked.

     Chloe's eyes are eerily bright with desperation.  Jack, in
     a sincere attempt at levity, chokes out:

                             JACK
                 You look good.  You ... look ... like
                 a pirate.

     Chloe laughs, a little too much.  Jack squeezes out a laugh.
     Then he sees Marla, off by herself.  Someone heads for her.

                             JACK
                 Excuse me, I have to...

     Jack gives a quick nod to Chloe and darts towards Marla.
     Chloe watches him go.

     STAY ON JACK AND MARLA as Jack CLAMPS his arms around her.
     He whispers into her ear.

                             JACK
                 We need to talk.

                             MARLA
                 Sure.

                             JACK
                 I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You
                 aren't dying.

                             MARLA
                 What?

                             JACK
                 Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy
                 way, we're all dying.  But you're not
                 dying the way Chloe is dying.

                             LEADER
                 Tell the other person how you feel.

                             JACK
                 You're a tourist.  I saw you at
                 melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular
                 cancer.

                             MARLA
                 And I saw you practicing this...

                             JACK
                 Practicing what?

                             MARLA
                 Telling me off.  Is it going as well
                 as you hoped... ?
                       (reads his nametag)
                 "... Mr. Taylor."

                             JACK
                 I'll expose you.

                             MARLA
                 Go ahead.  I'll expose you.

                             LEADER
                 Share yourself completely.

     Marla puts her head down on Jack's shoulder as if she were
     crying.  Jack pulls her head back up.  She deadpans at him.

                             JACK
                 Why are you doing this?

                             MARLA
                 It's cheaper than a movie, and
                 there's free coffee.

                             JACK
                 These are my groups.  I was here
                 first.  I've been coming for a year.

                             MARLA
                 A year?  How'd you manage that?

                             JACK
                 Anyone who might've noticed either
                 died or recovered and never came back.

                             LEADER
                 Let yourself cry.

                             MARLA
                 Why do you do it?

                             JACK
                 I... I don't know.  I guess... when
                 people think you're dying, they
                 really listen, instead...

                             MARLA
                 -- Instead of just waiting for their
                 turn to speak.

                             JACK
                 Yeah.

     Brief recognition between them, broken as the Leader passes.

                             LEADER
                 Quietly, now.  Share with each other.

     Jack waits till the Leader's out of earshot.

                             JACK
                       (warning)
                 It becomes an addiction.

                             MARLA
                 Really?

     Jack sighs, then pulls back.

                             JACK
                 Look, I can't cry with a faker
                 present.

                             MARLA
                 Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not
                 my problem.

                             JACK
                 Please.  Can't we do something... ?

     Marla starts out of the room.  Jack follows her.

                             LEADER
                 Now, the closing prayer.

     EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

     Marla gets to the sidewalk, moving quickly along.

                             JACK
                 We'll split up the week.  You can
                 have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --

                             MARLA
                 You take tuberculosis.  My smoking
                 doesn't go over at all.

                             JACK
                 I think testicular cancer should be
                 no contest.

                             MARLA
                 Well, technically, I have more of a
                 right to be there than you.  You
                 still have your balls.

                             JACK
                 You're kidding.

                             MARLA
                 I don't know -- am I?

     Jack follow Marla into...

     INT. LAUNDROMAT - CONTINUOUS

     Marla walks with authority up to an unwatched DRYER.  She
     takes out clothes, picks out jeans, pants and shirts.

                             MARLA
                 I'll take the parasites.

                             JACK
                 You can't have both parasites.  You
                 can take blood parasites --

                             MARLA
                 I want brain parasites.

                             JACK
                 Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and
                 organic brain dementia --

                             MARLA
                 I want that.

                             JACK
                 You can't have the whole brain!

                             MARLA
                 So far, you have four and I only have
                 two!

                             JACK
                 Then, take blood parasites.  It's
                 yours.  Now we each have three.

     Marla gathers the chosen garments and heads out past Jack...

     EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

     Jack follows, bewildered.

                             JACK
                 You... left half your clothes.

     HONK!  Jack starts.  Marla's led him into the street with
     traffic barreling down.

     Marla walks on, oblivious as CARS screech to a halt, HORNS
     BLARING.  Jack dashes, following...

     INT. THRIFT STORE - CONTINUOUS

     Marla drops the pile of clothes on a counter.  An old CLERK
     sifts through the clothes, begins writing on a pad.

                             JACK
                 You're selling those?

     Marla steps down hard on Jack's foot.  He winces in pain.

                             MARLA
                       (for the Clerk to hear)
                 Yes, I'm selling some chothes.

     The Clerk starts to ring up the assessed amounts.

                             MARLA
                 So, we each have three -- that's six.
                 What about the seventh day?  I want
                 ascending bowel cancer.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The girl had done her homework.

                             JACK
                 I want ascending bowel cancer.

     The Clerk gives a strange look as he hands money to Marla.

                             MARLA
                 That's your favorite, too?  Tried to
                 slip it by me, eh?

                             JACK
                 We'll split it.  You get it the first
                 and third Sunday of the month.

                             MARLA
                 Deal.

     They shake.  Jack tries to withdraw his hand; Marla holds it.

                             MARLA
                 Looks like this is goodbye.

                             JACK
                 Let's not make a big thing out of it.

     She walks to the door, pocketing money, not looking back.

                             MARLA
                 How's this for not making a big thing?

     Jack watches her go.  A moment, then he follows after...

     EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

     Jack hesitates, unsure, then run/walks to catch up to her...

                             JACK
                 Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange
                 numbers?

                             MARLA
                 Should we?

                             JACK
                 In case we want to switch nights.

                             MARLA
                 I suppose.

     Jack takes out a business card, writes his number on the
     back, hands it to her.  She takes the pen, grabs his hand
     and writes her number on his palm.  She walks into the
     street, causing more SCREECHING and HONKING.  She turns,
     holds up the card.

                             MARLA
                 It doesn't have your name.  Who are
                 you?  Cornelius?  Mr. Taylor?  Dr.
                 Zaius?  Any of the stupid names you
                 give each night?

     Jack starts to answer, but the traffic noise is too loud.
     Marla just shakes her head, turns, and keeps moving.  A BUS
     moves into view, obscuring her.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This is how I met Marla Singer.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY

     The plane touches down; the cabin BUMPS.  Jack's eyes open.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You wake up at O'Hare.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY

     Jack snaps awake again, looking around, disoriented.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You wake up at SeaTac.

     EXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK

     The rear of a CRASHED CAR sticks up by the side of the road.
     Jack stands, marking on a clipboard.  The SUN SETS behind.

     INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

     Jack stands at a gate counter.  An ATTENDANT smiles at him.

                             ATTENDANT
                 Check-in for that flight doesn't
                 begin for another two hours, Sir.

     Jack looks with blearing eyes at his watch, steps away and
     looks at an overhanging CLOCK.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Pacific, Mountain, Central.  Lose an
                 hour, gain an hour.  This is your
                 life, and it's ending one minute at
                 a time.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY

     Jack's eyes snap open as the plane LANDS.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You wake up at Air Harbor
                 International.

     INT. AIRPORT WALKWAY

     Jack stands on a conveyor belt, briefcase at his feet.  He
     watches PEOPLE MOVING PAST on the opposite conveyor.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If you wake up at a different time
                 and in a different place, could you
                 wake up as a different person?

     Jack misses seeing TYLER on the opposite conveyor belt.
     They pass each other.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - NIGHT

     Jack sits next to a BUSINESSMAN.  As they have idle
     CONVERSATION, we MOVE IN ON Jack's tray.  An ATTENDANT'S
     HANDS set coffee down with a small container of cream.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Everywhere I travel -- tiny life.
                 Single-serving sugar, single-serving
                 cream, single pat of butter.

                                                      CUT TO:

     HANDS place a dinner tray down.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Microwave Cordon Bleu hobby kit.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Jack brushes his teeth in the MIRROR.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Shampoo/conditioner combo.  Single-
                 serving mouthwash, tiny bar of soap.

     Jack picks up an individual, wrapped Q-TIP, looks at it.  He
     moves out of the bathroom into...

     MAIN ROOM

     Jack sits on the bed.  He turns on the TV.  It's tuned to
     the "Sheraton Channel," shows WAITERS serving people in a
     large BANQUET ROOM.  Jack stops brushing his teeth, feels
     something on the bed, lifts it -- a small DINNER MINT.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - NIGHT

     Jack sits next to a frumpy WOMAN.  They chat.  Jack turns to
     look at his food, takes a bite.  He turns back and it's...

     --a BALD MAN next to him, talking.  Jack takes another bite,
     turns back and it's...

     --a BUSINESSMAN next to him.  Jack takes another bite, turns
     back, and it's...

     --a BUSINESS WOMAN next to him.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The people I meet on each flight --
                 they're single-serving friends.
                 Between take-off and landing, we have
                 our time together, but that's all we
                 get.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - LANDING

     Jack's eyes snap open.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You wake up at Logan.

     INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     A giant corrugated METAL DOOR opens.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 On a long enough time line, the
                 survival rate for everyone drops to
                 zero.

     Two TECHNICIANS lead Jack to the BURNT-OUT SHELL of a
     WRECKED AUTOMOBILE.  Jack sets down his briefcase, opens it
     and starts to make notes on a CLIPBOARDED FORM.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I'm a recall coordinator.  My job is
                 to apply the formula.  It's a story
                 problem.

                             TECHNICIAN #1
                 Here's where the infant went through
                 the windshield.  Three points.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 A new car built by my company leaves
                 somewhere traveling at 60 miles per
                 hour.  The rear differential locks up.

                             TECHNICIAN #2
                 The teenager's braces around the
                 backseat ashtray would make a good
                 "anti-smoking" ad.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The car crashes and burns with
                 everyone trapped inside.  Now: do we
                 initiate a recall?

                             TECHNICIAN #1
                 The father must've been huge.  See
                 how the fat burnt into the driver's
                 seat with his polyester shirt?  Very
                 "modern art."

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Take the number of vehicles in the
                 field, (A), and multiply it by the
                 probable rate of failure, (B), then
                 multiply the result by the average
                 out-of-court settlement, (C).  A
                 times B times C equals X...

                                                      CUT TO:

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - MOVING DOWN RUNWAY

     Jack is speaking to the BUSINESSWOMAN next to him.

                             JACK
                 If X is less than the cost of a
                 recall, we don't do one.

                             BUSISNESS WOMAN
                 Are there a lot of these kinds of
                 accidents?

                             JACK
                 Oh, you wouldn't believe.

                             BUSINESS WOMAN
                 ... Which... car company do you work
                 for?

                             JACK
                 A major one.

     Turgid silence.  Jack turns to the window.  He sees a
     PELICAN get SUCKED into the TURBINE.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Every time the plane banked too
                 sharply on take-off or landing, I
                 prayed for a crash, or a mid-air
                 collision -- anything.

     Jack's face remains bland during the following: the plane
     BUCKLES -- the cabin wobbles.  People panic.  Masks drop.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 No more haircuts.  Nothing matters,
                 not even bad breath.

     The side of the plane SHEARS OFF!  Screaming PASSENGERS are
     sucked out into the night air, flying past the quivering
     wind.  Magazines and other objects fly everywhere.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Life insurance pays off triple if you
                 die on a business trip.

     Jack remains in his same position, same bland expression.

     DING! -- the seatbelt light goes OUT.  Jack SNAPS AWAKE.
     EVERYTHING IS NORMAL.  Some passengers get out of their
     seats.  From next to Jack, a VOICE we've heard before...

                             VOICE
                 There are three ways to make napalm.
                 One, mix equal parts of gasoline and
                 frozen orange juice...

     Jack turns to see TYLER.  Without turned to Jack, Tyler
     continues:

                             TYLER
                 Two, equal parts gasoline and diet
                 cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter
                 in gasoline until the mixture is
                 thick.

                             JACK
                 Pardon me?

     Tyler turns to Jack.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This is how I met --

                             TYLER
                 Tyler Durden.

     Tyler offers his hand.  Jack takes it.

                             TYLER
                 You know why they have oxygen masks
                 on planes?

                             JACK
                 No, supply oxygen?

                             TYLER
                 Oxygen gets you high.  In a
                 catastrophic emergency, we're taking
                 giant, panicked breaths...

     Tyler grabs a safety instruction CARD from the seatback,
     hands it to Jack.

                             TYLER
                 Suddenly, we become euphoic and
                 docile.  We accept our fate.

     Tyler points to passive faces on the drawn figures.

                             TYLER
                 Emergency water landing, 600 miles
                 per hour.  Blank faces -- calm as
                 Hindu cows.

     Jack laughs.

                             JACK
                 What do you do, Tyler?

                             TYLER
                 What do you want me to do?

                             JACK
                 I mean -- for a living.

                             TYLER
                 Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's
                 what you do." -- And be a smug little
                 shit about it?

     Jack laughs.  Tyler reaches under the seat in front of him
     and lifts a BRIEFCASE.

                             TYLER
                 You have a kind of sick desperation
                 in your laugh.

     Jack points to his own briefcase.

                             JACK
                 We have the same briefcase.

     Tyler turns the top of his briefcase toward Jack.

                             TYLER
                 Open it.

     Jack looks at Tyler, then pops the latches and raises the
     lid to reveal quaintly-wrapped bars of SOAP.

                             TYLER
                 Soap -- the yardstick of civilization.
                       (reaches in his pocket)
                 I make and sell soap...

     Tyler hands Jack his card.  "THE PAPER STREET SOAP COMPANY."

                             TYLER
                 If you were to add nitric acid to the
                 soap-making process, one would get
                 nitroglycerin.  With enough soap, one
                 could blow up the world, if one were
                 so inclined.

     Tyler SNAPS the briefcase shut.  Jack stares.

                             JACK
                 Tyler, you are by far the most
                 interesting "single-serving" friend
                 I've ever met.

     Tyler stares back.  Jack, enjoying his own chance to be
     witty, leans closer to Tyler.

                             JACK
                 You see, when you travel, everything
                 is small, self-contained--

                             TYLER
                 The spork.  I get it.  You're very
                 clever.

                             JACK
                 Thank you.

                             TYLER
                 How's that working out for you?

                             JACK
                 What?

                             TYLER
                 Being clever.

                             JACK
                       (thrown)
                 Well, uh... great.

                             TYLER
                 Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.

     Tyler stands, looks towards the aisle.

                             TYLER
                 ... As I squeeze past, do I give you
                 the ass or the crotch?

     Tyler moves to the aisle, his ass toward jack, walks away...

                             TYLER
                 We are defined by the choices we make.

     Tyler goes to the curtain dividing First Class, slaps the
     curtain aside and sits in an empty seat.  Jack watches.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 How I came to live with Tyler is:
                 airlines have this policy about
                 vibrating luggage.

     INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - NIGHT

     Utterly empty of baggage.  No people except for Jack and a
     SECURITY TASK FORCE MAN.  The Security TFM, smirking, holds
     a receiver to his ear from an official phone on the wall.

                             SECURITY TFM
                       (to Jack)
                 Throwers don't worry about ticking.
                 Modern bombs don't tick.

                             JACK
                 Excuse me?  "Throwers?"

                             SECURITY TFM
                 Baggage handlers.  But when a
                 suitcase vibrates, the throwers have
                 to call the police.

                             JACK
                 My suitcase was vibrating?

                             SECURITY TFM
                 Nine time out of ten, it's an
                 electric razor.  But, every once in
                 a while ...
                       (whispers)
                 ...it's a dildo.  It's airline policy
                 not to imply ownership in the event
                 of a dildo.  We use the indefinite
                 aricle: "A dildo."  Never "Your
                 dildo."

     Jack sees, through the window, Tyler, at the curb, throwing
     his briefcase into the back of a shiny, red CONVERTIBLE.
     Tyler leaps over the door into the driver's seat and PEELS
     OUT.  jack turns away, looks at the Security TFM.

     In the background, a HARRIED MAN dashes after Tyler and the
     convertible, SCREAMING.

                             JACK
                       (to Security TFM)
                 I had everything in that bag.  My
                 C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...

                             SECURITY TFM
                       (into phone)
                 Yeah, uh huh... yeah?
                       (pause, still on phone)
                 Oh...

     EXT. EMPTY RUNWAY

     A lone SUITCASE sits on the concrete.  SECURITY PERSONNEL
     keep their distance.  KABOOM!  The suitcase explodes.

     INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - RESUMING

     The Security TFM, shakes his head, hangs up.

                             SECURITY TFM
                 I'm terribly sorry.

     The Security TFM hands Jack a claim form.  Jack snatches it,
     disgusted, takes out a pen, starts filling out the form.

                             SECURITY TFM
                 You know the industry slang for
                 "Flight Attendant?"  "Air Mattress."

     INT. TAXI - MOVING - NIGHT

     Along a residential street.  Jack looks ahead, sees a tall,
     grey, bland BUILDING on the corner.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Home was a condo on the fifteenth
                 floor of a filing cabinet for widows
                 and young professionals.  The walls
                 were solid concrete.  A foot of
                 concrete is important when your next-
                 door neighbor lets her hearing aid go
                 and has to watch game shows at full
                 volume...

     The taxi turns a corner and Jack sees the front of the
     building.  A diffuse CLOUD of SMOKE wafts away from a BLOWN-
     OUT SECTION of the fifteenth floor.  FIRETRUCKS, POLICE CARS
     and a MOB are all crowded around the lobby area.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 -- Or when a volcanic blast of debris
                 that used to be your furniture and
                 personal effects blows out your floor-
                 to-ceiling windows and sails flaming
                 into the night.

     EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF BUILDING

     Jack, gaping at the sight above him, absently gives the
     Cabbie money.  The taxi pulls away.  Jack starts toward the
     building.  He pushes through the fray of people, into the...

     INT. LOBBY

     The DOORMAN sees Jack enter, gives a sad smile, shakes his
     head.  Jack starts for the elevator.

                             DOORMAN
                 There's nothing up there.

     Jack presses the button.  The Doorman moves next to him.

                             DOORMAN
                 You can't go into the unit.  Police
                 orders.

     The elevator doors open.  Jack hesitates.  The doors close.
     Jack heads out the lobby doors.  The Doorman follows...

     EXT. CONDO BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

     Jack walks past SMOKING, CHARRED DEBRIS -- a flash of ORANGE
     from the Yang table, a CLOCK FACE from the hall clock, part
     of an arm from the GREEN ARMCHAIR.  His feet CRUNCH glass.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 How embarrassing.

                             DOORMAN
                 Do you have somebody you can call?

     Jack comes to his REFRIGERATOR lying on its side.  He
     reaches down and takes a note: "MARLA --" and a phone
     number, from under a BANANA MAGNET.

     CLOSE SHOT - JACK'S STOVE

     Hissing.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The police would later tell me that
                 the pilot light might have gone
                 out... letting out just a little bit
                 of gas.

     EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING

     Jack gets to a PAYPHONE.  The Doorman follows, watching him.

                             DOORMAN
                 Lots of young people try to impress
                 the world and buy too many things.

     Jack picks up the receiver, puts in a quarter.  He looks at
     Marla's number a long moment.

     CLOSE SHOT - JACK'S ENTIRE CONDO - KITCHEN AND LIVING ROOM

     The SOUND of the HISS...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The gas could have slowly filled the
                 condo.  Seventeen-hundred square feet
                 with high ceilings, for days and days.

     EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING

     Jack replaces the receiver.  He pockets Marla's number, digs
     out a small FILOFAX.  He flips through the pages for phone
     numbers and addresses.  Most of the pages are blank.

                             DOORMAN
                 Many young people feel trapped and
                 desperate.

     INSERT - CLOSE ON THE BASE OF JACK'S REFRIGERATOR

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Then, the refrigerator's compressor
                 could have clicked on...

     Click.  KABOOM!  SCREEN GOES WHITE.

     EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING

     Jack looks at the Doorman.  Tyler's BUSINESS CARD falls from
     the Filofax.  Jack catches it.

                             DOORMAN
                 If you don't know what you want, you
                 end up with a lot you don't.

     The Doorman walks away.  Jack stares at Tyler's card.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If you asked me now, I couldn't tell
                 you why I called him.

     Jack re-deposits the quarter, dials Tyler's number.  It
     RINGS... and RINGS and RINGS.  Jack sighs and hangs up the
     phone.  A moment, then the phone RINGS.

                             JACK
                 Hello?

                             TYLER'S VOICE
                 Who's this?

                             JACK
                 Tyler?

                             TYLER'S VOICE
                 Who's this?

                             JACK
                 Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the
                 plane.  We had the same briefcase.
                 I'm... you know, the clever guy.

                             TYLER'S VOICE
                 Oh, yeah.

                             JACK
                 I just called a second ago.  There
                 was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.

                             TYLER'S VOICE
                 I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick
                 up my phone.  What's up?

                             JACK
                 Well... let me see... here's the
                 thing...

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN - NIGHT

     A small building in the middle of a concrete parking lot.

     INT. LOU'S TAVERN - SAME

     Jack and Tyler sit in the back, with a pitcher of BEER.

                             JACK
                 You buy furniture.  You tell
                 yourself: this is the last sofa I'll
                 ever need.  No matter what else
                 happens, I've got the sofa issue
                 handled.  Then, the right set of
                 dishes.  The right dinette.

                             TYLER
                 This is how we fill up our lives.

     Tyler lights a cigarette.

                             JACK
                 I guess so.

                             TYLER
                 And, now it's gone.

                             JACK
                 All gone.

     Tyler offers cigarettes.  Jack declines.

                             TYLER
                 Could be worse.  A woman could cut
                 off your penis while you're asleep
                 and toss it out the window of a
                 moving car.

                             JACK
                 There's always that.

                             TYLER
                 I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe
                 it's a terrible tragedy.

                             JACK
                 ...no ...no ...

                             TYLER
                 I mean, you did lose a lot of nice,
                 neat little shit.  The trendy paper
                 lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit,
                 am I right?

     Jack laughs, nods.  He shakes his head, drinks.

                             TYLER
                 But maybe, just maybe, you've been
                 delivered.

                             JACK
                       (toasts)
                 Delivered from Swedish furniture.

                             TYLER
                 Delivered from armchairs in obscure
                 green stripe patterns.

                             JACK
                 Delivered from Martha Stewart.

                             TYLER
                 Delivered from bullshit colors like
                 "Cobalt," "Ebony," and "Fuchsia."

     They laugh together.  Then, silence.  They drink.

                             JACK
                 Insurance'll cover it.

                             TYLER
                 Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the
                 list.

                             JACK
                 What list?

                             TYLER
                 The "now I get to go out and buy the
                 exact same stuff all over again"
                 list.  That list.

                             JACK
                 I don't... think so.

                             TYLER
                 This time maybe get a widescreen TV.
                 You'll be occupied for weeks.

                             JACK
                 Well, I have to file a claim...

                             TYLER
                 The things you own, they end up
                 owning you.

                             JACK
                 Don't I?

                             TYLER
                 Do what you like.

                             JACK
                       (looks at watch)
                 God, it's late.  I should find a
                 hotel...

                             TYLER
                 A hotel?

                             JACK
                 Yeah.

                             TYLER
                 So, you called me up, because you
                 just wanted to have a drink before
                 you... go find a hotel?

                             JACK
                 I don't follow...

                             TYLER
                 We're on our third pitcher of beer.
                 Just ask me.

                             JACK
                 Huh?

                             TYLER
                 You called me so you could have a
                 place to stay.

                             JACK
                 No, I...

                             TYLER
                 Why don't you cut the shit and ask if
                 you can stay at my place?

                             JACK
                 Would that be a problem?

                             TYLER
                 Is it a problem for you to ask?

                             JACK
                 Can I stay at your place?

                             TYLER
                 Yes, you can.

                             JACK
                 Thank you.

                             TYLER
                 You're welcome.  But, I want you to
                 do me one favor.

                             JACK
                 What's that?

                             TYLER
                 I want you to hit me as hard as you
                 can.

                             JACK
                 What?

                             TYLER
                 I want you to hit me as hard as you
                 can.

     Freeze picture.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Let me tell you a little bit about
                 Tyler Durden.

     EXTREME CLOSE-UP - FILM FRAME

     -- And we see it's PORNOGRAPHY.

     INT. PROJECTIONIST ROOM - THEATRE - NIGHT

     Jack, in the foreground, FACES CAMERA.  In the BACKGROUND,
     Tyler sits at a bench, looking at individual FRAMES cut from
     movies.  Near him, a PROJECTOR rolls film.

                             JACK
                 Tyler was a night person.  He
                 sometimes worked as a projectionist.
                 A movie doesn't come in one big reel,
                 it's on a few.  In old theaters, two
                 projectors are used, so someone has
                 to change projectors at the exact
                 second when one reel ends and
                 another reel begins.  Sometimes you
                 can see two dots on screen in the
                 upper right hand corner...

     Tyler points to the side of OUR FRAME and the TWO DOTS
     briefly APPEAR ONSCREEN.

                             TYLER
                 They're called "cigarette burns."

                             JACK
                 It's called a "changeover."  The
                 movie goes on, and nobody in the
                 audience has any idea.

                             TYLER
                 Why would anyone want this shitty job?

                             JACK
                 It affords him other interesting
                 opportunities.

                             TYLER
                 -- Like splicing single frames from
                 adult movies into family films.

                             JACK
                 In reel three, right after the
                 courageous dog and the snooty cag --
                 who have celebrity voices -- eat out
                 of a garbage can, there's the flash
                 of Tyler's contribution...

     In the AUDIENCE, CHILDREN suddenly start squirming,
     confused, looking at each other.

     A WOMAN abruptly stops sucking her soda straw, feeling
     vaguely terrible.  Her uncomfortable HUSBAND slowly leans
     back in his seat.

     Jack and Tyler watch from the projection booth window.

                             TYLER
                 One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's
                 how long it's up there.

                             JACK
                 No one really knows that they've seen it.
                 But they did.

                             TYLER
                 A nice, big cock.

                             JACK
                 Only a hummingbird could have caught
                 Tyler at work.

     INT. LARGE BANQUET HALL - NIGHT

     Tyler moves around one of many tables, setting down SOUP
     BOWLS.  Jack stands in the same position, FACING CAMERA.

                             JACK
                 Tyler also worked as a banquet waiter
                 at the luxurious Pressman Hotel.

     The GUESTS command the WAITERS with snaps of fingers.

     INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - NIGHT

     Jack turns and WE PAN to Tyler, standing by a CART with a
     giant SOUP TUREEN.  His hands are at his open fly and he's
     in position to piss into the soup.

                             JACK
                 He was the guerrilla terrorist of the
                 food service industry.

                             TYLER
                 Don't watch.  I can't if you watch.

     Jack waits.  The SOUND of a STREAM of LIQUID is HEARD.

                             TYLER
                 ... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.

                             JACK
                 He farted on meringue; he sneezed on
                 braised endive; and, with creme of
                 mushroom soup, well...

                             TYLER (O.S.)
                 Go ahead.  Say it.

                             JACK
                 You get the idea.

     EXT. PARKING LOT OF TAVERN - RESUMING

     Tyler and Jack come out the back door.

                             JACK
                 I don't know about this.

                             TYLER
                 I don't know, either.  I want to find
                 out.  I've never been hit, have you?

                             JACK
                 No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?

                             TYLER
                 I don't want to die without any
                 scars.  How much can you really know
                 about yourself if you've never been
                 in a fight?  Come on... you're the
                 only person I've ever asked.

                             JACK
                 Me?

     Jack stares at him.

                             TYLER
                 Why not you?  I'm letting you go
                 first.  Do it.

                             JACK
                 This is crazy.

                             TYLER
                 Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.

                             JACK
                 Where do you want it?  In the face?

                             TYLER
                 Surprise me.

     Jack swings a wide, clumsy roundhouse -- hits Tyler's
     neck -- makes a dull, flat sound.

                             JACK
                 Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.

                             TYLER
                 Like hell.  That counted.

     Tyler shoots out a straight punch to Jack's chest.  Jack
     falls back against a car.  His eyes tear up.

                             TYLER
                 How do you feel?

                             JACK
                 Strange.

                             TYLER
                 But a good strange.

                             JACK
                 Is it?

                             TYLER
                 We've crossed the threshold.  You
                 want to call it off?

                             JACK
                 Call what off?

                             TYLER
                 The fight.

                             JACK
                 What fight?

                             TYLER
                 This fight, pussy.

     Jack swings another roundhouse that slams right under
     Tyler's ear.  Tyler punches Jack in the stomach.  Tyler and
     Jack move clumsily, throwing punches.  They breathe heavier,
     drooling saliva and blood, growing dizzier from every impact.

     EXT. CURBSIDE - LATER

     Jack and Tyler sit on the curb, watching sparse headlights
     on the nearby freeway.  Their eyes are glazed with endorphin-
     induced serenity.  They look at each other, laugh.  Look away.

                             TYLER
                 If you could fight anyone... one on
                 one, whoever you wanted, who would
                 you fight?

                             JACK
                 Anyone?

                             TYLER
                 Anyone.

     Jack thinks.

                             JACK
                 My boss, probably.
                       (pause)
                 Who would you fight?

                             TYLER
                 My dad.  No question.

     A long pause as Jack studies Tyler's face.

                             JACK
                 Oh, yeah.
                       (nodding)
                 I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew
                 him, till I was six.  He went and
                 married another woman, had more kids.
                 Every six years or so he'd do it
                 again -- new city, new family.

                             TYLER
                 He was setting up franchises.  My
                 father never went to college, so it
                 was really important that I go.

                             JACK
                 I know that.

                             TYLER
                 After I graduated, I called him long
                 distance and asked, "Now what?"  He
                 said, "Get a job."  When I turned
                 twenty-five, I called him and asked,
                 "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know.
                 Get married."

                             JACK
                 Same here.

                             TYLER
                 A generation of men raised by women.
                 I'm wondering if another woman is the
                 answer we really need.

     Another pause.  Jack feels his bleeding lip, smiles.

                             JACK
                 We should do this again sometime.

     Tyler cracks a smile, give a sidelong glance to Jack.

     EXT. PAPER STREET - NIGHT

     A street sign: "PAPER STREET."  A PAPER MILL stis on one
     side, facing a lone HOUSE on the other.  The rest of the
     land is grass and weeds.  It's a grand, old three-story,
     long abandoned.  Tyler leads Jack toward it.

                             JACK
                 Where's your car?

                             TYLER
                 What car?

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I don't know how Tyler found the
                 house, but he'd been there for half
                 a year.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - ENTRANCE -- NIGHT

     Tyler leads Jack through the FRONT DOOR...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 It looked like it was waiting to be
                 torn down.  Most of the windows were
                 boarded up.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENT LATER

     Tyler and Jack climb CREAKY STAIRS to the 2ND FLOOR LANDING.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 None of the doors locked.  The stairs
                 were ready to collapse.  I didn't
                 know if he owned it or he was
                 squatting.

     Tyler opens the door to a ROOM...

     INT. ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Jack enters, stis on the creaky BED.  Dust drifts upwards.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Neither would have surprised me.

     INT. SHOWER - MORNING

     Jack turns on the water.  LOUD VIBRATIONS from the walls.
     Water spits in starts.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Nothing worked.  The rusty plumbing
                 leaked.  Turning on a light meant
                 another light in the house went out.

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     All the tavern's lights are off.  Tyler and Jack FIGHT.
     FIVE GUYS stand around watching.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

     Jack, his face showing NEW BRUISES AND CUTS, makes coffee
     with a wire-mesh strainer.  Tyler shuffles in, wearing a
     flannel bathrobe.  He spears pieces of bread on a fork,
     starts roasting them over a burner.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 There were no neighbors.  Just
                 warehouses and the paper mill.  The
                 fart smell of steam, the hamster cage
                 smell of wood chips.

     EXT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - NIGHT

     Jack sits watching as Tyler SWINGS an old GOLF CLUB --
     THWACK -- sends a golf ball soaring down the desolate street.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 At night, Tyler and I were alone for
                 half a mile in every direction.

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     All the lights are off.  TEN GUYS YELL, standing around Jack
     and Tyler, who FIGHT.  THREE CARS are parked in the lot.

     INT. BASEMENT - DAY

     Jack sits on basement stairs, watching as Tyler, knee-deep
     in water, works at an open FUSEBOX, flipping breakers in a
     certain order, showing Jack how it's done.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 When it rained, we had to kill the
                 power.  By the end of the first
                 month, I didn't care about TV.  I
                 didn't mind the warm, stale
                 refrigerator.

     INT. READING ROOM - NIGHT

     CANDLES BURN.  Tyler and Jack are seated across from each
     other on the buckled floor, reading MAGAZINES.  Rain DRIPS
     from the ceiling.  No furniture.  THOUSANDS of MAGAZINES.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The previous occupant had been a bit
                 of a shut-in.

                             TYLER
                       (of magazine)
                 Hum.

                             JACK
                 What?

                             TYLER
                 Oh, a new riot control grenade...
                       (reading)
                 "...the successful combination of
                 concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash-
                 blasts and simultaneous high-velocity
                 disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."

     Tyler begins RIPPING the ARTICLE from his magazine.

                             JACK
                       ("Reader's Digest")
                 "I am Joe's Lungs."  It's written in
                 first person.  "Without me, Joe could
                 not take in oxygen to feed his red
                 blood cells."  There's a whole
                 series -- "I am Joe's Prostate."

                             TYLER
                 "I get cancer, and I kill Joe."

     Tyler tosses his article in a pile of other articles,
     chooses another magazine.

                             JACK
                 What are you reading?

                             TYLER
                 Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week.
                 New Republic.

                             JACK
                 Show-off.

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     All the lights are off.  Jack and Tyler stand amidst FIFTEEN
     GUYS around TWO GUYS FIGHTING.  The crowd YELLS MORE WILDLY
     than before.  In the background are EIGHT PARKED CARS.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I should have been haggling with my
                 insurance company.  I should have
                 been looking for a new condo...

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Jack walks along.  He stops, looking at a CHURCH with
     SUPPORT-GROUP-PEOPLE milling around the entrance, drinking
     coffee and sodas.  Marla's there, amongst them, smoking.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 .... I should have been upset about
                 my nice, neat, flaming little shit.

     Jack's face shows no reaction.  He continues to walk.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 But I wasn't.

     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

     Jack, in work clothes, interlocks his fingers and POPS his
     knuckles, picks up a saucepan with coffee and sips.  Tyler,
     in waiter's uniform, comes to have Jack straighten his tie.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Most of the week, we were Ozzie and
                 Harriet.

     Jack picks up his briefcase and walks out the door.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 But, Wednesday night, ever Wednesday
                 night...

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     All the lights are off.  No one around, but there are at
     least TWENTY-FIVE CARS parked in the full lot.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 ... we were finding something out: we
                 were finding out, more and more, that
                 we were not alone.

     INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     A SLIDE SHOW progresses, run by a chipper salesman, WALTER.
     Jack sits, deadpan, with a PUFFY LIP and a BRUISED cheek.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Thursday mornings, all I could do was
                 think about next week.

     Boss gives Jack a dubious look.  Walter's next SLIDE: a
     COMPUTER SCREEN.

                             WALTER
                 The basic premise of cyber-netting
                 your office is -- make things more
                 efficient.

                             BOSS
                 Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?

                             WALTER
                 Absolutely.

     Walter continues, his sales pitch drowned out by Jack's V.O.:

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Walter, the Microsoft account exec.
                 Walter, with his smooth, soft hands.
                 Maybe he was thinking about the free-
                 range potluck he'd been to last
                 weekend, or his church-group car-wash
                 fund-raiser.  Or, probably not.

     Walter moves to Jack and slaps him in the shoulder.

                             WALTER
                 I showed this already to my man here.
                 You liked it, didn't you?

     Jack smiles.  His teeth are RED with BLOOD.  They GLOW
     eerily in the dim light.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You can swallow a pint of blood
                 before you get sick.

                             WALTER
                 Jesus, I'd hate to see what happened
                 to the other guy.

     Jack keeps the smile frozen on his face.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Screw Walter.  His candy-ass wouldn't
                 last a second Wednesday night.

     EXT. LOU'S TAVERN - NIGHT

     Out of silent darkness, HEADLIGHTS appear from all
     directions.  CARS PULL UP and park in the already-packed
     lot.  YOUNG MEN get out and march into the tavern...

     INT. LOU'S TAVERN - SAME

     The men, including Jack and Tyler, enter and stand against
     the back wall, waiting.  The bartender, IRVINE, calls out:

                             IRVINE
                 Drink up people.  We're closing.

     Irvine flicks on the LIGHTS.  Drunken customers squint and
     get the message.  They plop down money, leaving.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 It was right in everyone's face.
                 Tyler and I just made it visible.

     Irvine hits a button and the JUKEBOX loses power.  Members
     of the waiting army begins to share secret looks.  Finally,
     one buy locks the door.  Two other guys close the blinds.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 It was on the tip of everyone's
                 tongue.  Tyler and I just gave it a
                 name.

     INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - SAME

     A BOMB-SHELTER.  Concrete walls.  One BARE BULB above, Tyler
     standing directly beneath it.

                             TYLER
                 Welcome to fight club.

     The guys mill around, finding partners.  Everyone brims with
     eagerness, but tries to act cool.  CHATTER gets LOUDER.
     Everyone spreads out, forming a circle, Tyler at center.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Every week, Tyler gave the rules that
                 he and I decided.

     PEAKING CHATTER, till Tyler raises his arms and the CHATTER
     DIES.  A couple of COUGHS, FEET SHUFFLING, then, SILENCE.

                             TYLER
                 The first rule of fight club is --
                 you don't talk about fight club.  The
                 second rule of fight club is -- you
                 don't talk about fight club.  The
                 third rule of fight club is -- when
                 someone says "stop" or goes limp, the
                 fight is over.  Fourth rule is --
                 only two guys to a fight.  Fifth
                 rule -- one fight at a time.  Sixth
                 rule -- no shirts, no shoes.  Seventh
                 rule -- fights go on as long as they
                 have to.  And the eighth and final
                 rule -- if this is your first night
                 at fight club, you have to fight.

     Tyler steps back.  A short guy, RICKY, and a GOATEED MAN
     take off shirts and shoes and step to the center.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This kid, Ricky -- supply clerk --
                 couldn't remember whether you ordered
                 pens with blue ink or black ink ...

     The two fighters circle, then begin throwing PUNCHES...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 But Ricky was a god for ten minutes
                 last week when he trounced an actuary
                 twice his size.

     Harder, faster PUNCHES between the two.  SWEAT flies.
     SHOUTS become DEAFENING.  Ricky's getting the best of
     Goateed Man, POUNDING him...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Sometimes all you could hear were
                 flat, hard packing sounds over the
                 yelling, or the wet choke when
                 someone caught their breath and
                 sprayed...

                             GOATEED MAN
                       (spittle-lipped)
                 Ssssstop... !

     INT. OFFICE PARK RESTAURANT - DAY

     Jack, eating lunch, watches the BROKEN-NOSED WAITER with a
     GOATEE -- from the above fight -- converse with a MAITRE D'.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Even if I could tell someone they had
                 a good fight, I wouldn't be talking
                 to the same man.

     The Goateed Waiter approaches Jack and sets a refill soda
     down on the table.  The two of them briefly make eye contact.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Who you were in fight club is not who
                 you were in the rest of the world.

     INT. PHOTOCOPY ROOM - DAY

     Jack stands over a copy machine, hit by flashes of light.
     He glances over his shoulder, watches Ricky, wearing an
     apron, push a supply cart.  Ricks nods at Jack.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You weren't alive anywhere like you
                 were there.  But fight club only
                 exists in the hours between when
                 fight club starts and when fight club
                 ends.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack, playing SOLITAIRE on his computer, daubs blood from
     his mouth with a handkerchief.  Boss, passing by the
     doorway, looks in at Jack, irritated.

                             BOSS
                 What are you getting yourself into
                 every week?

     Jack keeps playing Solitaire.  Boss enters, folds his arms.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 After fight club, everything else in
                 your life gets the volume turned
                 down.  You can deal with anything.

                             BOSS
                 Have you finished those reports?

                             JACK
                       (handing him reports)
                 Yes.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The people who had power over you
                 have less and less.

     Jack looks at Boss.  Reflexively, Jack's tongue plays with
     his teeth.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 By this point, I could wiggle most of
                 the teeth in my jaw.

     EXT. STREET - DUSK

     Tyler and Jack walk, both smoking cigarettes.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 A guy came to fight club for the
                 first time, his ass was a wad of
                 cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he
                 was carved out of wood.

                             JACK
                 If you could fight any celebrity?

                             TYLER
                 Alive or dead?

                             JACK
                 Doesn't matter.

                             TYLER
                 Hemingway.  You?

                             JACK
                 Shatner.  William Shatner.

     They reach a BUS STOP as a BUS arrives, tossing their
     cigarettes, getting on board...

     INT. BUS - DUSK

     The bus is crowded.  As Tyler and Jack walk toward the back,
     Jack studies the faces of OTHER PASSENGERS...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 We all started seeing things
                 differently.  Wherever we went.

     They hold hand grips.  Jack looks up at an ADVERTISEMENT; a
     CALVIN KLEIN ad featuring a tan, bare-chested MUSCLE STUD.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I felt sorry for all the guys packing
                 into gyms, trying to look like what
                 Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger said
                 they should.

     Tyler looks at Jack, looks at the C.K. advertisement.

                             TYLER
                 Self-improvement is masturbation.
                 Self-destruction is the answer.

     A MAN in a suit KNOCKS Tyler's shoulder as he passes.  The
     Man takes a handle, close by.  Jack's pissed, staring at the
     man, who stares back.

                             JACK
                       (to Tyler, so the
                        Man can hear)
                 You could take him.

     Tyler looks to Jack, glances over his shoulder at the Man.
     Tyler casually picks a small scab off Jack's nostril.

                             TYLER
                 The trick is not to care.

     Tyler stares forward.

     INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - NIGHT

     Tyler HITS the floor, stomach first.  HIS OPPONENT lands on
     top of him, grappling, trying for a CHOKE HOLD.  The
     surrounding CROWD, Jack included, SCREAMS at them...

     Tyler and the Opponent wrestle desperately, and Tyler flips
     his attacker, gets on top, sprawling to pin him.  Tyler
     turns -- starts reining PUNCHES into the Opponent's GROIN...

                                                      CUT TO:

     Jack lands a couple of BLOWS to HIS OPPONENT'S stomach --
     brings up a left uppercut that smashes the Opponent's jaw.
     Tiny spatters of BLOOD adorn the walls, along with sweat.

     Jack catches sight of a swollen-faced Tyler, watching
     appreciatively, a smile growing slowly on his face.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Fight club wasn't about winning or
                 losing.  It wasn't about words.

     The Opponent recovers, throws a headlock on Jack.  Jack
     snakes his arm into a counter headlock.  They wrestle like
     wild animals.  The crowd CHEERS maniacally.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 They hysterical shouting was in
                 tongues, like at a Pentecostal church.

     Onlookers kneel to stay with the fight, cheering LOUDER.
     The Opponent SMASHES Jack's head to the floor, over and over.

                             JACK
                 ... stop...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 When the fight was over, nothing was
                 solved, but nothing mattered.

     Everyone moves in as the Opponent steps away.  Tyler pushes
     through the crowd.  Others lift Jack up.  They turn their
     attention to the floor, to a BLOOD MASK of Jack's face --
     similar to the TEAR MASK on BOB'S SHIRT.

                             TYLER
                 Cool.

     Jack limply shakes his Opponent's hand.

                             OPPONENT
                 How about next week?

                             JACK
                 Look at me.  How about next month?

     Everyone helps Jack walk.  He's sweating, bleeding, smiling.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Afterwards, we all felt saved.

     INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

     A NURSE tends to Jack while Tyler watches.

                             TYLER
                 He fell down some stairs.

     The Nurse doesn't look at Tyler, just keeps tending to Jack.

                             JACK
                 I fell down some stairs.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Sometimes Tyler spoke for me.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING

     Tyler and Jack share the cracked MIRROR.  Tyler's clipping
     at his hair with blunt, ill-suited SCISSORS.  Jack's
     brushing his teeth, spitting out pink foam.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Fight club became the reason to cut
                 your hair short and trim your
                 fingernails.

                             TYLER
                 Any historical figure.

                             JACK
                 Okay... Ghandi.

                             TYLER
                 Good answer.

                             JACK
                 You?

                             TYLER
                 Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys
                 fight till they're burger.

     Jack reaches in his mouth, exploring, pulls -- yanks a
     TOOTH.  Jack looks at it.  Tyler puts scissors down, done.

                             TYLER
                 Remember, even the Mona Lisa's
                 falling apart.

     Jack drops the tooth in the sink with Tyler's hair.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

     Jack enters, buttoning his shirt.  The PHONE RINGS.

                             JACK
                 Hello?

     INTERCUT WITH...

     INT. MARLA'S BUILDING, HALLWAY - SAME

     Marla's in the HALL, on the PAYPHONE, twisting the phone
     cord around her neck.

                             MARLA
                 Where have you been the last few
                 weeks?

                             JACK
                 Marla?

     Jack looks through the archway and sees Tyler, in his gummy
     flannel bathrobe, doing sit-ups.  Jack leans, cups the phone.

                             JACK
                       (quietly)
                 How did you find me?

                             MARLA
                 The forwarding number.  I haven't
                 seen you at any support groups.

                             JACK
                 That's the idea -- we split them.

                             MARLA
                 You haven't been going to yours.

                             JACK
                 I found a new one.

                             MARLA
                 Really?

                             JACK
                 It's for men.

                             MARLA
                 Like testicular cancer?

                             JACK
                 Look, this is a bad time...

                             MARLA
                 I've been going to debtor's
                 anonymous.  You want to see some
                 truly fucked up people?

                             JACK
                 I'm just on my way out...

                             MARLA
                 Me too.  I got a stomach full of
                 Xanax.  I took what was left of a
                 bottle.  Might've been too much.

     Jack looks exasperated, turns TO LOOK INTO THE CAMERA.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Picture yourself watching Marla
                 Singer throw herself around her
                 crummy apartment.

                             MARLA
                 This isn't a for-real suicide thing.
                 This is probably one of those cry-for-
                 help things.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 This could go on for hours.

                             JACK
                 So you're staying in tonight?

                             MARLA
                 Do you want to wait to hear me
                 describe death?

     Jack puts the handset on top of the phone, still off the
     hook, walks out the back door.

                             MARLA'S VOICE
                 Do you want to listen and see if my
                 spirit can use the telephone?

     Thru the archway: Tyler leans to look in, curious.

     INT. BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

     GRUNTS of PLEASURE and EXERTION.  Glimpses of TORSOS, ASSES,
     LEGS, ARMS, BREASTS, and FEMALE HAIR, all DRENCHED in SWEAT.
     Sheets RIP.  Bodies hit the FLOOR.  Insane GRUNTING and
     LAUGHING.  A flash of MARLA'S FACE.

                                                      CUT TO:

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - SUNRISE

     Jack sits up in bed, looks around the room.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING

     Jack steps out of his room.  The neighboring door is closed.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Tyler's door was closed.  I'd been
                 living here two months, and Tyler's
                 door was never closed.

     INT. BATHROOM - SAME

     Jack stares into the TOILER, looking at SIX USED CONDOMS.

     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

     Jack sits at the table, sips coffee, read Reader's Digest.
     He hears FOOTSTEPS approaching.

                             JACK
                 You're not going to believe what I
                 dreamt last night.

     Marla walks in, straightening her dress, looks like she's
     been raped by a hurricane.  Jack's jaw drops.

                             MARLA
                 I can hardly believe anything about
                 last night.

     Marla goes to pour coffee.  She takes a swig, GARGLES and
     SPITS it in the sink.  She gives Jack a lascivious smile.

                             JACK
                 What are you doing here?

                             MARLA
                 What... ?

                             JACK
                 What the hell are you doing here?

     Marla stares at him a beat, then drops the cup in the sink.

                             MARLA
                 Fuck you.

     Marla shoves open the door to the backyard and walks out.
     Jack gets up, watches her stomp away.

     Jack turns and -- Tyler is at his shoulder, staring after
     Marla.  He's in his usual sweatpants.  He grins at Jack,
     then moves away, pours himself coffee.  Jack, smoldering,
     slumps at the table and picks up Reader's Digest.  Tyler
     puts his foot on a countertop, does stretching exercises.

                             TYLER
                 She's a piece of work.  Get this --
                 I come in here last night, the
                 phone's off the hook...

     Jack pretends to read, quickly glances at Tyler.  TYLER'S
     VOICE FADES...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I already knew the story before he
                 told it to me.

     INT. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)

     Tyler enters, gently lifts the handset and listens.

                             MARLA'S VOICE
                       (from handset)
                 I'll tell you when I'm floating out
                 of my body.

     Tyler smiles.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 How could Tyler, off all people, think
                 it was a bad thing that Marla Singer
                 was about to die?

     INT. MARLA'S - 8TH FLOOR LANDING - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)

     Tyler, a wry smile on his face, ambles up the stiars,
     looking at the rotting walls.  He reaches the top of the
     stairs and heads for Marla's room.  Before he can knock,
     Marla's hand shoots out and grabs him...

     INT. MARLA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)

     Marla pulls Tyler inside and shuts the door.  Her drugged
     eyes look him over.

                             MARLA
                 You got here fast.

     She staggers and sits on the bed.  She slides off, along
     with the blanket and sheets, to the floor.

                             MARLA
                 The mattresses are all sealed in
                 slippery plastic.

     She tries to focus her eyes on Tyler.

                             MARLA
                 Did I call you?

     Tyler studies her with cynical curiosity, looks at a DILDO
     lying atop a dresser.  Marla follows his gaze.

                             MARLA
                 Don't worry.  It's not a threat to you.

     SIRENS and vehicles SCREECHING outside can be HEARD; doors
     opening and SLAMMING; running FOOTFALLS.

                             MARLA
                 Oh, no!  Somebody called the cops...

     She gets to her feet, grabs Tyler, pulls him out the door.

     INT. HALLWAY (FLASHBACK)

     Marla LOCKS her door, then pulls Tyler toward the STAIRCASE.
     COPS and PARAMEDICS charge up with oxygen and medical kits.
     Marla and Tyler flatten against the wall to let them pass.

                             COP
                 8-G!  Where's 8-G?

                             MARLA
                       (pointing)
                 End of the hall.

     The rescuers keep running.

                             MARLA
                       (calling after)
                 The girl who lives there used to be
                 a charming, lovely girl, but she's
                 lost faith in herself...

                             COP
                 Miss Singer, let us help you!  You
                 have every reason to live!

     Marla yanks Tyler's arm, heading down the stairs.

                             MARLA
                 She's a monster!  Infectious human
                 waste!  Good luck trying to save her!

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

     Tyler makes coffee.  Marla slouches against the refrigerator.

                             MARLA
                 If I fall asleep, I'm done for.
                 You're gonna have to keep me up all
                 night.

     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING (RESUMING)

     Tyler chuckles, shakes his head.

                             TYLER
                 Unbelievable, huh?

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 He was obviously able to handle it.

     Tyler stands across from Jack, gets a cigarette from a pack.

                             TYLER
                 I mean, this girl... uh, you're not
                 into her or anything... ?

                             JACK
                 No.  Not at all.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I am Jack's Raging Bile Duct.

     Tyler lights his cigarette.

                             TYLER
                 You're sure?

                             JACK
                 Yeah, I'm sure.

                             TYLER
                 Good.  This chick was up on the table
                 with her legs in the stirrups before
                 the doctor even walked in the room.
                 The things that she said... I've
                 never heard a woman talk like that...

     INT. TYLER'S ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

     Tyler smokes, post-coital.  Marla puts her lips to his ear.

                             MARLA
                       (whispering)
                 I want to have your abortion.

     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING (RESUMING)

     Tyler laughs, shakes his head.  Jack's gripping his Reader's
     Digest just a little too tight.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 How could Tyler not go for that?
                 Night before last, he was splicing
                 sex organs into "Little Mermaid."

     Tyler sits, studies Jack's face.

                             TYLER
                 You're okay with this?

                             JACK
                 I'm fine.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Put a gun to my head and paint the
                 wall with my brains.

     Tyler smokes.

                             TYLER
                 She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay
                 away from that one.

                             JACK
                 Oh, and my pace is more librarians.

                             TYLER
                 Hey... don't knock librarians.

                             JACK
                 Marla doesn't need a lover.  She
                 needs a case worker.

                             TYLER
                 She needs an exorcist.  This isn't
                 love.  This is sport-fucking.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 She'd invaded my support groups, now
                 she's invading my home.

                             TYLER
                 Listen... do me a favor... sit here
                 a minute...

     Tyler pulls out a closer chair, motions to it.  Jack puts
     down his Reader's Digest and moves to that chair.

                             JACK
                 What?

                             TYLER
                 You've gotta understand something
                 about me.  I have a little rule,
                 okay?  Don't ever talk to her about
                 me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind
                 of shit.

     Tyler fixes Jack with a friendly, but firm stare.

                             TYLER
                 If you ever say anything about me or
                 about what happens here in this
                 house, to her or anyone -- I will
                 find out.  And you'll never see me
                 again.  Promise me.

                             JACK
                 Okay.

                             TYLER
                 Promise you won't.

                             JACK
                 Yes, I promise.

                             TYLER
                 Promise?

                             JACK
                 I said I promise!

                             TYLER
                 That was three times you promised.

     Tyler smiles, gets up and leaves.  Jack sits smoldering.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 If only I had wasted a couple of
                 minutes and gone to watch Marla die,
                 none of this would have happened.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     Jack watches TV at HIGH VOLUME.  SOUNDS of SEX from upstairs.

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Jack lies calmly on his bed, staring at the ceiling.  Sounds
     of THUMPS and CRASHES from beyond the wall.

                             MARLA'S VOICE
                       (muffled through wall)
                 Miserable fucking discharge!

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I could've moved to another room, one
                 on the third floor -- so I wouldn't
                 have heard them.  But I didn't.

     INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

     SOUNDS of RAIN.  Jack flips FUSES off, then walks upstairs.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING - SAME

     Jack walks, HEARS Marla SCREAM in orgasm.  He reaches the
     landing.  Tyler's door is ajar.  Jack peeks in...

     Marla's legs are sprawled on the bed.  The door PUSHES OPEN
     WIDER -- Tyler, naked, stands CLOSE TO CAMERA.

                             TYLER
                 What are you doing?

     Jack steps back.

                             JACK
                 I... uh... just going to bed.

     Tyler scratches his head, wears a RUBBER GLOVE.

                             TYLER
                 You want to finish her off?

                             JACK
                 Uh... nah...

     Jack continues toward his room.

     INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Jack brushes his teeth.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I became the calm, little center of
                 the world.  I was the Zen master.

     CLOSE UP - COMPUTER MONITOR

     Haiku is BEING TYPED in a trendy, italicized font.

                              "Worker bees can leave
                               Even drones can fly away
                               The queen is their slave"

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I wrote little haiku poems.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack's clothes are PERMANENTLY STAINED with BLOOD.  He sits
     in Zen pose, cigarette in mouth, finishes typing Haiku.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I faxed them around to everyone.

     He hits "SEND," gets the "ERROR CHIME" SOUND.  He presses
     this key over and over.  Boss enters.

                             BOSS
                 Is that your blood?

                             JACK
                 Some of it, yes.

     Boss stares at Jack like he's from Mars.

                             BOSS
                 Take the rest of the day off.  Come
                 back tomorrow with clean clothes.
                 Get yourself together.

     INT. HALLWAY - SAME

     Jack's leaving, looks like a war casualty, passing COWORKERS
     who coldly stare at him.  His face is totally passive.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I got right in everyone's hostile
                 little face.  Yes, these are bruises
                 from fighting.  I'm comfortable with
                 them.  I am enlightened.

     EXT. PAPER STREET - SUNSET

     Jack walks toward the HOUSE.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 You give up the condo life, give up
                 all your flaming worldly possessions,
                 go live in a dilapidated house in the
                 toxic waste part of town...

     INT. TYLER'S KITCHEN - SUNSET

     Jack walks in.  SOUNDS of VIOLENT SEX and a POLAROID CAMERA
     from upstairs.  Pieces of PLASTER fall from the ceiling.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 ... and you come home to this.

                             TYLER'S VOICE
                       (laughing)
                 You fucking slut!!

                             MARLA'S VOICE
                 Thank you, sir, may I have another!
                 Thank you sir, may I have another... !

     Jack rolls his eyes, takes off his pants.  He runs water in
     the sink, finds a tiny bit of SOAP and scrubs at the blood
     stains.  The PHONE RINGS.  He answers it.

                             JACK
                 Yeah.  Speaking.

     INTERCUT WITH...

     INT. POLICE STATION - OFFICE

     A cop, DETECTIVE STERN, refers to a file.

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 This is Detective Stern with the
                 arson unit.  We have some new
                 information about the "incident" at
                 your condo.

                             JACK
                 Yes?

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 I don't know if you're aware... your
                 front door -- it seems someone
                 sprayed freon into the lock, then
                 tapped it with a chisel to shatter
                 the cylinder.

                             JACK
                 No, I wasn't aware...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I am Jack's Cold Sweat.

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 Does this sound strange to you?

                             JACK
                 Yes, sire, strange.  Very strange.

     Jack starts to sweat, scrubs his pants obsessively.

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 The dynamite...

                             JACK
                 Dynamite?

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium
                 oxalate and potassium perchloride.
                 Do you know what that means?

                             JACK
                 What does that mean?

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 It means it was homemade.

                             JACK
                 This is... really a shock...

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 Whoever set this homemade dynamite
                 could've blown out the pilot light
                 days before the explosion.  The gas,
                 it seems, was just a detonator.

                             JACK
                 Who do you think could've done this?

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 I'll ask the questions, son.

                             TYLER
                       (whispering in Jack's ear)
                 Tell him...

     Jack almost leaps out his skin, startled; looks to see Tyler
     standing right next to him.

                             JACK
                 Huh?

                             TYLER
                       (overlap w/below)
                 "The liberator who destroyed my
                 property has re-aligned my paradigm
                 of perception."

                             JACK
                 Shhhhhh!
                       (into phone,
                        overlap w/above)
                 I don't know what to make of this,
                 sir, I really don't...

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 Do you know anyone who'd have the
                 expertise or motive to do something
                 like this?

                             TYLER
                 "I reject the basic assumptions of
                 civilization, including material
                 possession."

     Jack pushes Tyler away, cups the receiving.

                             JACK
                       (into phone)
                 No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo.
                 I loved every stick of furniture.
                 The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were
                 me.  The dishes were me.  The plants
                 were...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I'd like to thank the academy...

                             DETECTIVE STERN
                 Well, if any ideas come to you, give
                 me a call.  In the meantime, don't
                 leave town.  I may need to bring you
                 in for questioning.

     END INTERCUT

     Jack hangs up.  Tyler shrugs.

                             TYLER
                 Could be worse.  You could be cursed
                 with the three terrible Karmas.  You
                 could be beautiful, rich and famous.

     Jack turns away, continues to scrub his pants.  Marla's
     FOOTSTEPS can be HEARD coming downstairs...

     Jack really grinds the soap against the pants, splashing
     water.  He turns, sees Marla enter.  Tyler is GONE.  Marla
     lights a cigarette.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Except for their humping, Tyler and
                 Marla were never in the same room.

                             MARLA
                 I got this dress at a thrift store
                 for one dollar.

                             JACK
                       (keeps scrubbing)
                 Worth every penny.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 My parents pulled this exact act for
                 years -- one came in, the other
                 disappeared.

     Marla begins a slow, exotic dance, moving very close to
     Jack.  She lifts her dress dangerously high, dancing close
     to Jack's body, almost touhcing.

                             MARLA
                       (seductive)
                 It's a bridesmaid's dress.  Someone
                 loved it intensely for one day, then
                 tossed it.  Like a Christmas tree --
                 so special, then, bam -- it's
                 abandoned on the side of the road,
                 tinsel still clinging to it...

     Jack becomes very aware of having no pants on, presses
     against the counter.  Marla pulls her hemline further up.

                             MARLA
                 Like sex crime victims, underwear
                 inside-out, bound with electrical
                 tape.

                             JACK
                       (coldly)
                 It suits you.

     She leans in very close to Jack's ear, whispers hoarsely:

                             MARLA
                 You can borrow it sometime.

     Jack takes a step away, keeps scrubbing.  Marla blows smoke
     in his face.  Jack takes her cigarette and throws it in the
     sink.  Marla backs away, fed up, storms out, going UPSTAIRS.

                             TYLER (O.S.)
                 Get rid of her.

     Jack turns to see Tyler in the doorway.

                             JACK
                 You get rid of her.

                             TYLER
                       (pointing at Jack)
                 Don't mention me.

     Marla's FOOTSTEPS are coming DOWNSTAIRS.  Jack looks to the
     archway, then back at -- Tyler's GONE.  Marla enters, shoes
     and balled up clothing under one arm, looking for something
     on the junk strewn table.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I'm six years old again, passing
                 messages between my parents.

                             JACK
                 I, uh... think you should go now.

     Marla ignores, still searching the table, tossing things,
     pushing other things off to the floor.

                             JACK
                 It's time for you to leave.

                             MARLA
                 Don't worry, I'm leaving.

     Marla finds what she wanted, a pack of cigarettes.  She
     moves up into Jack's face.

                             MARLA
                 You're such a nutcase, I can't even
                 begin to keep up.

                             JACK
                 Goodbye.

     She laughs, spins on her heels.  As she exits the back door,
     she sings "This Merry-Go-Round" from "Valley of the Dolls."
     Jack watches her through the kitchen window.

                             TYLER (O.S.)
                 Nice work.

     Jack turns.  Tyler's right behind him.  Through the window,
     Marla can be seen walking away.  Tyler picks up the remnant
     of SOAP Jack's been using, holds it up to Jack.

                             TYLER
                 To make soap, first we have to render
                 fat.

     Jack looks at Tyler.

     CLOSE UP - SIGN: "DANGER - BIOHAZARD."

     EXT. FENCED-IN BIOHAZARD WASTE DUMP SITE - NIGHT

     Tyler stands inside the fence.  Jack's atop the fence,
     struggling to cross BARBED WIRE.  He wobbles, gets over,
     snags his shirt.  Jack falls, RIPPPPP.  Tyler helps.

     FOOTSTEPS.  A FLASHLIGHT BEAM.  Tyler pulls Jack behind a
     DUMPSTER, one of DOZENS.  A silhouette of a SECURITY GUARD
     moves along the perimeter, flashlight first.  He walks away.

     MOVE BACK to Tyler and Jack, who emerge from hiding.  Tyler
     eagerly grabs the lid of the closest dumpster.

                             TYLER
                 The best fat for making soap --
                 because the salt balance is just
                 right -- comes form human bodies...

     Tyler lifts the lid -- it CREAKS.

                             JACK
                 What is this place?

                             TYLER
                 A liposuction clinic.

     From the dumpster, Tyler pulls out an industrial-sized,
     thick plastic bag full of PINK GOO.

                             TYLER
                 Paydirt.  From society's richest
                 asses and thighs.

     TIME CUT: Tyler and Jack climb back over the fence, carrying
     BAGS of fat.  One of Jack's bags RIPS, spilling the goo down
     the chain-link fench.  Jack slips and slides.  Tyler laughs.
     Tyler tries to scoop the running fat back into the bag.

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Jack and Tyler each stir a boiling pot.

                             TYLER
                 As the fat renders, the tallow floats
                 to the surface.  Remember the crap
                 they taught you in Boy Scouts.

                             JACK
                 Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.

                             TYLER
                 This clear layer in glycerin.  We'll
                 mix it back in when we make the soap.

     Tyler sticks a spoon into a pot, lifts up a scoop of the
     glycerin layer.  Then, he crabs a can, opens it.

                             TYLER
                 Lye -- the crucial ingredient.
                       (adding lye to mix)
                 Ancient peoples found their clothes
                 got cleaner if they washed them at a
                 certain spot in the river.  Why?
                 Because, human sacrifices were once
                 made on the hills above this river.
                 Year after year, bodies burnt.  Rain
                 feel.  Water seeped through the wood
                 ashes to become lye.  The lye
                 combined with the melted fat of the
                 bodies, till a thick white soapy
                 discharge crept into the river.

     Tyler licks his lips until they're gleaming wet.  He takes
     Jack's hands and KISSES the back of it.

                             TYLER
                 The first soap was made from the
                 ashes of heroes.  Like the first
                 monkeys shot into space.

     The saliva shines in the shape of the kiss.  Tyler pours a
     bit of the flaked lye onto Jack's hand.

                             TYLER
                 Without sacrifice, without death, we
                 would have nothing.

     Jack's whole body JERKS.  Tyler holds tight to Jack's hand
     and arm.  Tears well in Jack's eyes; his face tightens.

                             TYLER
                 This is a chemical burn.  It will
                 hurt more than you've ever been
                 burned and you will have a scar.

     Jack looks -- the burn is swollen, glossy, in the shape of
     Tyler's kiss.  Jack's face spasms.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the
                 back of my hand.

                             TYLER
                 Look at your hand.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Guided meditation worked for cancer,
                 it could work for this.

     SHOT OF A GREEN MAPLE LEAF, GLISTENING WITH DEW.  RESUME:

     Tyler looks at Jack's glazed and detached eyes.

                             TYLER
                 Come back to the pain.  Don't shut
                 this out.

     Jack, snapping back, tries to jerk his hand away.  Tyler
     keeps hold of it and their arms KNOCK UTENSILS off the table.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I tried not to think of the words
                 "searing" or "flesh."  I imagined my
                 pain as a ball of healing white light.

     SHOT OF A FOREST, IN GENTLE SPRING RAINFALL.  RESUME:

     Tyler JERKS Jack's hand, getting Jack's attention...

                             TYLER
                 Stop it.  This is your pain -- your
                 burning hand.  It's right here.  Look
                 at it.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I was going to my cave to find my
                 power animal.

     SHOT OF THE INSIDE OF JACK'S FROZEN ICE CAVE.  RESUME:

     Tyler JERKS Jack's hand again.  Jack re-focuses on Tyler...

                             TYLER
                 Don't deal with this the way those
                 dead people do.  Deal with it the way
                 a living person does.

     SHOT OF INSIDE THE ICE CAVE - ON MARLA, LYING NAKED UNDER A
     FUR COAT, TURNING HER HEAD TO LOOK TOWARDS US.  RESUME:

     Jack tries to pull his hand free.  Tyler won't let go.
     Jack's eyes glaze over again.  Jack speaks, whiny from pain:

                             JACK
                 I... I think I understand.  I think
                 I get it...

                             TYLER
                 No, what you're feeling is premature
                 enlightenment.

     SHOT OF A GREEN FOREST WITHOUT RAIN.  RESUME:

     Tyler SLAPS Jack's face, regaining his attention...

                             TYLER
                 This is the greatest moment of your
                 life and you're off somewhere,
                 missing it.

                             JACK
                 No, I'm not...

     SHOT OF TREES ENGULFED BY A FOREST FIRE.  RESUME:

                             TYLER
                 Shut up.  Our fathers were our models
                 for God.  And, if our fathers bailed,
                 what does that tell us about God?

                             JACK
                 I don't know...

     SHOT OF EMBERS POURING FROM THE HELLISH FOREST FIRE.  RESUME:

     Tyler SLAPS Jack's face again...

                             TYLER
                 Listen to me.  You have to consider
                 the possibility that God doesn't like
                 you, he never wanted you.  In all
                 probability, He hates you.  This is
                 not the worst thing that can happen...

                             JACK
                 It isn't... ?

                             TYLER
                 We don't need him...

                             JACK
                 We don't... ?

     SHOT OF INSIDE ICE CAVE - NAKED MARLA PULLS JACK DOWN ON TOP
     OF HER - JACK KISSES HER - CIGARETTE SMOKE COMES FROM HER
     MOUTH - JACK COUGHS.  RESUME:

     Jack is a wide-eyed zombie...

                             JACK
                 ... Marla ... ?

                             TYLER
                 Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We
                 are God's unwanted children, with no
                 special place and no special
                 attention, and so be it.

     Jack looks at Tyler -- they lock eyes.  Jack does his best
     to stifle his spasms of pain, his body a quivering, coiled
     knot.  He bolts toward the sink, but Tyler holds on.

                             TYLER
                 You can go to the sink and run water
                 over your hand.  Look at me.  Or you
                 can use vinegar to neutralize the
                 burn, but first you have to give up.
                 First, you have to know that someday,
                 you are going to die.  Until you know
                 that, you will be useless.

     Jack spasms with a shiver of pain...

                             JACK
                 You ... you don't know what this
                 feels like, Tyler.

     Tyler shows Jack a LYE-BURNED KISS SCAR on his own hand.
     Tears begin to drip from Jack's eyes.  Tyler grabs a bottle
     of VINEGAR -- pours it over Jack's wound.

     Jack closes his eyes, holds his hand... slumps to the floor.

                             TYLER
                 Congratulations.  You're a step
                 closer to hitting bottom.

     INT. BARNEY'S - DAY

     Jack and Tyler, in trench coats, looking like deaht-warmed-
     over, wait as a BUYER fills out forms.

     There are bars of "The Paper Street Soap Company" soap on
     the counter.  Jack looks like he's half-expecting to get
     arrested.  His hand is BANDAGED.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Tyler sold the soap to department
                 stores at twenty bucks a Ear.  God
                 knows what they charged.  How ironic.
                 We were selling rich women their own
                 fat asses back to them.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack sits at his desk, playing a game on his computer,
     smoking a cigarette.  Boss enters.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 He was wearing a yellow tie.  It must
                 be Thursday.  I didn't even wear a tie
                 to work anymore.

     Boss slaps a piece of PAPER down on Jack's desk.

                             BOSS
                 "The first rule of fight club is you
                 don't talk about fight club."

     Jack snuffs his cigarette in an ashtray, stares up stoically.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I must've left the original in the
                 copy machine.

                             BOSS
                 "The second rule of fight club...
                 Is this yours?

                             JACK
                 Hmm?

                             BOSS
                 You don't get paid to abuse the copy
                 machine.

                             JACK
                 "Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an
                 image.

                             BOSS
                 Pretend you're me.  You find this.
                 What would you do?

     Jack rises slowly, walks to his door, shuts it.

                             JACK
                 Me? I'd be very careful who I talked
                 to about this.  It sounds like
                 someone dangerous wrote it... someone
                 who might snap at any moment,
                 stalking from office to office with
                 an Armalite AR-10 Carbine-gas
                 semiautomatic, bitterly pumping round
                 after round into colleagues and co-
                 workers.

     Jack moves very close to Boss, picks up the PAPER and starts
     tearing it into pieces.

                             JACK
                 Might be someone you've known for
                 years... somebody very close to you.
                 Or, maybe you shouldn't be bringing
                 me every little piece of trash you
                 pick up.

     Jack puts the PAPER in his trash.  Bass stares with a tinge
     of outrage, a tinge of fear.  PHONE RINGS.  Jack answers it.

                             JACK
                 Compliance and Liability.

                             MARLA'S VOICE
                 My tit's going to rot off.

                             JACK
                 Just a second.
                       (to Boss; smiles)
                 Could you excuse me?  I need to take
                 this call.

     Boss goes to the door, stares at Jack a beat, then leaves.

                             JACK
                       (into phone)
                 What are you talking about?

     INTERCUT WITH - CLOSE UP OF MARLA...

                             MARLA
                 Would you do something for me?  I
                 need you to check and see if there's
                 a lump in my breast.  I can't afford
                 to throw money away on a doctor.

                             JACK
                 I don't know ...

                             MARLA
                 Please.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 She didn't call Tyler.  I'm neutral
                 in her book.

     EXT. MARLA'S HOTEL - SUNSET

     Jack walks down the sidewalk, seeing Marla take two BOXES
     from a VAN with the sign "MEALS ON WHEELS."

     INT. MARLA'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

     Marla leads Jack inside.

                             JACK
                 This is a sweet side of you.  Picking
                 these up for ...
                       (reads the boxes:)
                 "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines."
                 Where are they?

                             MARLA
                 Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive
                 and I'm in poverty.  You want any?

                             JACK
                 No, thanks.

                             MARLA
                 Good.

     He stares at her while she eats.

                             MARLA
                 What happened to your hand?

     Jack awkwardly puts his bandaged hand behind his back.

                             JACK
                 Nothing.

     INT. MARLA'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Marla stands facing a MIRROR with her shirt open.  Jack
     stands behind her with his hand on the bottom side of her
     breast.  Marla's hand guides his.

                             JACK
                 Where?  Here?

                             MARLA
                 Here.

                             JACK
                 There?

                             MARLA
                 Here.

                             JACK
                 Here.

                             MARLA
                 Feel anything?

                             JACK
                 No.

     Jack's head is behind Marla's.  They speak softer, slower.

                             MARLA
                 Make sure.

                             JACK
                 Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.

                             MARLA
                 You feel nothing?

                             JACK
                 Nothing.

     Marla turns around and faces him, begins to button her shirt.

                             MARLA
                 Well, that's a relief.  Thank you.

                             JACK
                 No... no problem.

                             MARLA
                 I wish I could return the favor.

     Jack touches his own chest, shakes his head.

                             JACK
                 I think everything's okay here.

                             MARLA
                 I could check your prostate.

                             JACK
                 Uh ... nah.

                             MARLA
                       (pause)
                 Well... thanks, anyway.

     Marla leans to kiss him -- lingers for a bit longer than
     just friendly.  Jack pulls away.

                             JACK
                 So.... are we done?

     Marla sighs.

                             MARLA
                 Yeah, we're done.  See you around.

     EXT. HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack emerges from the lobby.  He looks up at Marla's window,
     watches her silhouette.  He walks away, right into -- Big
     BOB, the moose, eating a donut and drinking orange juice.

                             BOB
                 Cornelius!  How are you?

                             JACK
                 Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?

                             BOB
                 Better than I've ever been in my life.

                             JACK
                 Really?  Great.  Still "Remaining Men
                 Together?"

     An intense look of born-again fervor comes over Bob's face.

                             BOB
                 No.  I found something new.

                             JACK
                 Really, what's that?

                             BOB
                       (quietly)
                 The first rule is... you aren't
                 supposed to talk about it...

                             JACK
                 Oh.

                             BOB
                 And the second rule about it is...
                 you're not supposed to talk about it.
                 And the third rule...

                             JACK
                 Bob, Bob... I'm a member.

                                  BOB
                 You are?!

                             JACK
                 Look at my face.

     Bob roughly slaps Jack's shoulder.

                             BOB
                 That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking
                 great! Congratulations.

                             JACK
                 Yeah, both of us.

                             BOB
                 You know about the guy who invented
                 it? I hear all kinds of things.
                 Supposedly, he was born in a mental
                 institution.  They say he only sleeps
                 one hour a night.  You know about
                 this guy?  Tyler Durden?

     INT. BASEMENT - ELECTRONICS WKREHOUSE - NIGHT

     The CROWD SCREAMS insanely as Bob and Jack go at it in the
     circle of light.  Bob's eyes are wild with glee.

     EXT. BASEMENT DOOR - ELECTRONICS WAREHOUSE - LATER

     Everyone sneaks out of this new location - we've seen none
     of these guys before - it's a new chapter.  Jack and Bob
     Stagger out last, Jack being in worse shape.  They both grin
     with religious serenity.  Bob hugs Jack.

                             BOB
                 Thank you.  Thank you.

     Bob relaxes the hug and Jack drops to the ground like a
     sack, completely enervated from the beating he took.

                             JACK
                 You're welcome.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Fight club -- this was mine and
                 Tyler's gift... our gift to the world.

     INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING

     Jack has his briefcase on the table, looks at PAPERWORK.
     Tyler wanders in, carries a dirty pot to the sink.  Jack
     takes out a cigarette, lights up.  He offers the pack...

                             TYLER
                 No thanks, I quit.

                             JACK
                 You quit?

                             TYLER
                 Yeah.  Where you headed?

                             JACK
                 Work.  Going to work.

     Tyler scratches his chin absently.

                             JACK
                 What... ?

                             TYLER
                 Nothing.  Do what you like.

     Tyler walks out the way he came.

     INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack sits staring at his SCREEN SAVER.

     INT. BOSS'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jack steps into the open doorway, knocks on the doorframe.
     Boss looks up from his large, expensive desk.

                             JACK
                 We need to talk.

                             BOSS
                 Okay.  Where to begin?  With your
                 constant absenteeism?  With your
                 unpresentable appearance?  You're up
                 for review...

                             JACK
                 I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise.

     Boss sits up in his seat, becoming enraged.

                             JACK
                 Let's pretend.  You're the Department
                 of Transportation, and you discover
                 that our company intentionally did
                 nothing about leather seats cured in
                 third world countries with chemicals
                 we know cause birth defects?  Brake
                 linings that fail after a thousand
                 miles.  Fuel injectors that burn
                 people alive.

                             BOSS
                 Just who the fuck do you think you
                 are?!  Get out!  You're fired!

                             JACK
                 What about this?  Keep me on payroll
                 as an outside consultant.  In
                 exchange for my salary, I'll keep my
                 mouth shut.  I won't need to come to
                 the office.  I can do this job from
                 home.

     Boss stands, moves around his desk, glaring with rage.

                             BOSS
                 You little fucker!  I oughta...

     Jack PUNCHES HIMSELF in the nose.  Blood starts to trickle.
     He punches himself in the jaw, throws himself back as if by
     the force of the punch, SLAMS against a framed picture and
     SHATTERS the glass.  He falls to the floor.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I Am Jack's Smirking Revenge.

     Jack gets back to his feet.

                             JACK
                 Please... don't hit me again, please.
                 I'm your responsibility...

     He PUNCHES himself in the stomach, then in the jaw again.
     He reels backwards, pulls down a hanging shelf, its contents
     flying.  He hits the floor.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 For some reason, I thought of my
                 first fight -- with Tyler.

     Jack crawls toward Boss, dripping blood, grabs Boss's leg.

                             JACK
                 Please... give me the paychecks like
                 I asked for.  I won't be any trouble.
                 You won't see me again.

     Jack climbs up Boss's leg while Boss tries to shake him off.
     Boss stumbles back into his desk, knocking off belongings.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Under and behind and inside
                 everything this man took for granted,
                 something horrible had been growing.

     Jack crawls high enough to grab Boss's belt, hoisting
     himself up.  He dribbles blood an Boss's clothing, SMUDGES
     blood from his face onto the knuckles of Boss's hand.

                             JACK
                 Please... please...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 And right then, at our most excellent
                 moment together...

     Two SECURITY GUARDS enter and gape at the sight.  Behind
     them stand CURIOUS WORKERS, looking in.

                             JACK
                       (gurgling blood)
                 Please don't hit me again.

     INT. TYLER'S HOUSE - ENTRANCE FOYER - DAY

     Jack holds a CHECK in front of Tyler's face.

                             JACK
                 Six months advance pay.  Six months!

                             TYLER
                 Fucking sweet.

                             JACK
                 Okay, and... and...

     Jack digs in his pocket, takes out a thick bundle of CARDS.

                             JACK
                 Forty-eight airline flight coupons.
                 Plus... hold on... just a minute...

     Jack holds up a finger, going to open the front door.  He
     drags an unwieldy SHOPPING CART in behind him; filled with
     his COMPUTER, PHONE, FAX and other office equipment.

                             JACK
                 I am now officially self-employed.

     Jack looks at the cart, then back at Tyler, proud.

                             TYLER
                 Good for you.

     INT. LOU'S TAVERN - BASEMENT - NIGHT

     LOUD.  An enormous CROWD of guys, including Jack and Bob,
     stands around Tyler, who's in the center of the circle,
     holding up his hands to quiet them...

                             TYLER
                 I look around... I look around and
                 see a lot of new faces.

     An enthusiastic RUMBLE from the crowd.

                             TYLER
                 Shut up!  Which means a lot of you
                 have been breaking the first two
                 rules of fight club.

     A glum silence falls.  Guys look at each other.

                             TYLER
                 I see in fight club the strongest and
                 smartest men who have ever lived --
                 an entire generation pumping gas and
                 waiting tables; or they're slaves
                 with white collars.
                             (more)

                             TYLER (cont)
                 Advertisements have them chasing cars
                 and clothes, working jobs they hate
                 so they can buy shit they don't need.
                 We are the middle children of
                 history, with no purpose or place.
                 We have no great war, or great
                 depression.  The great war is a
                 spiritual war.  The great depression
                 is our lives.  We were raised by
                 television to believe that we'd be
                 millionaires and movie gods and rock
                 stars -- but we won't.  And we're
                 learning that fact.  And we're very,
                 very pissed-off.

     The crowd erupts into a DEAFENING CHORUS of agreement.  Jack
     looks at the blazing excitement in the eyes of the crowd.

                             TYLER
                 We are the quiet young men who listen
                 until it's time to decide.

     A fat, MIDDLE-AGED MAN stomps down the stairs, pushing into
     the crowd, followed by a TALL, HEFTY THUG who holds a GUM.

                             TYLER
                 Who are you?

                             FAT MAN (LOU)
                 Who am I?!  There's a sign on the
                 front that says "Lou's Tavern." I'm
                 fucking Lou.  Who the fuck are you?!

                             TYLER
                 Tyler Durden.

     Tyler extends his hand for a shake, but Lou SLAPS it away.

                             LOU
                 Who told you motherfuckers you could
                 use my place?

                             TYLER
                 We have a deal worked out with Irvine.

                             LOU
                 Irvine?  Irvine's at home with a
                 broken collarbone.

     Everyone glances guiltily at each other.

                             LOU
                 He don't own this place, I do.  How
                 much money's he getting for this?

                             TYLER
                 There is no money.

                             LOU
                 Really?

                             TYLER
                 It's free to all.

                             LOU
                 Ain't that something?

                             TYLER
                 Yes, it is.

                             LOU
                 Look, stupid fuck, I want everyone
                 outta here now!

                             TYLER
                 You're welcome to join our club.

                             LOU
                 Did you hear what I just said?!

                             TYLER
                 You and your friend.

     Lou SLUGS Tyler in the stomach, doubles him over.

                             LOU
                 You hear me now?

     Tyler gains his breath, determined.  He looks up, turns his
     head, looking to Jack.  Jack watches, wide-eyed.

     Tyler straightens, facing Lou.

                             TYLER
                 No, I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

     Lou PUNCHES Tyler in the face.  Some of the guys move
     forward, but the Thug points his gun.  Jack-runs forward
     anyway -- Lou PUNCHES him in the face.

     More guys move forward, but Tyler waves them off, facing Lou.

                             TYLER
                 We really need to use this place.

     Lou proceeds to beat the shit out of Tyler, PUNCHING his
     face, his stomach.  Tyler collapses to the floor.  Lou
     starts KICKING his.  Tyler bleeds from the mouth and face.

                             TYLER
                 That's it.... that's good.  Get it
                 all out.  You'll feel better.

     Lou flushes red with exasperation, KICKS more.  Finally,
     sweating, bewildered, Lou stops.  He looks to the Thug, who
     is just as bewildered.

     Suddenly, Tyler SPRINGS UP, grabs onto Lou...

                             TYLER
                 Yes, I am shit and crazy, to you and
                 this whole fucking world...

     Tyler's blood spatters on Lou.  Lou tries to shake Tyler
     off, but Tyler BITES Lou's NECKTIE.  The Thug grabs Tyler
     and pulls, the necktie tightening and strangling Lou.  Lou
     slaps at Tyler's face, but recoils from the blood.  Tyler
     spits and shouts through clenched teeth...

                             TYLER
                 You don't know where I've been.

     Tyler bear hugs Lou, pulls him to the floor.  Tyler rubs his
     bloody face into Lou's face.  The Thug lifts Tyler.  Tyler
     clings to Lou's belt, dragging Lou as he is dragged...

                             TYLER
                 We need this place.  We need it.
                 Please let us keep it, please...

     Blood dribbles out of Tyler's mouth, spattering Lou.

                             LOU
                 What are you doing?!

                             TYLER
                 Pleeeeeease!

                             LOU
                 Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the
                 basement!  Get off me!

                             TYLER
                 We need some towels, Lou.  We need
                 replacement light bulbs.

                             LOU
                 Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!

                             TYLER
                 Thank you.  Thank you, sir...

                             LOU
                 Let go of me!!

     Tyler lets go of Lou's belt.  Lou scrambles away.  The Thug
     drops Tyler, trying to keep clear of the blood.  Lou gets to
     his feet, looks at Tyler, then at the rest of the guys.  He
     and the Thug back away... slamming the door behind.

     Fight club surrounds Tyler.  They help him up, move him to
     a crate.  Tyler sits slumped for a long moment, his
     breathing labored... then, he sits back, crossing his legs
     and looking to the group, his demeanor businesslike.

                             TYLER
                 This week, each of you has a homework
                 assignment.  You're going to go out
                 and start a fight with a total
                 stranger...
                       (pause, drooling blood)
                 You're going to start a fight... and
                 you're going to lose.

     Jack beams in appreciation.

     EXT. STREET - DAY

     Ricky trips a passing YUPPIE.  The Yuppie falls.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Not as easy as it sounds.  People'll
                 do just about anything to avoid a
                 fight.

     The Yuppies gets up, angry, and Ricky PUNCHES him...

                             YUPPIE
                 Hey!  Wha... What the hell... what
                 are you doing?!  Who are you?!!

     The Yuppie backs away.  Ricky follows...

                             YUPPIE
                 Get away from me!  Keep away!
                 NO... !

     Ricky TACKLES the Yuppie.  The Yuppie struggles spastically.

                             YUPPIE
                 Who are you!?  Why are you attacking
                 me... ?!

     Having no recourse, the Yuppie begins trading blows.

     EXT. AUTO SHOP - DAY

     A MECHANIC WITH A BATTERED FACE uses a hose to wash the
     sidewalk.  As MEN pass, he jerks the hose up and SPRAYS them.

                             FIRST MAN
                 Hey... hey...

                             SECOND MAN
                 Watch out, jackass!

     These men continue on their way.

     The Mechanic sprays a third man, a SEMINARY STUDENT, who
     looks down, stunned.

                             SEMINARIAN
                 You... you did that on purpose!

     The Mechanic DOUSES the Seminarian.  The Seminarian grabs
     the hose, wrestling the Mechanic for it.  The Mechanic
     shoves the Seminarian, who responds with a half-assed PUNCH.
     The Mechanic purposely takes it.  The Seminarian starts to
     run away.  The Mechanic sprints after him, PUNCHING the
     Seminarian in the back of the neck.  They fight.

     INT. RECORD STORE STOCKROOM - NIGHT

     A FIST smashes a JAW.  Guys CHEER.  An arm snakes around a
     neck and squeezes, blood and sweat dripping.  It's the
     YUPPIE and the SEMINARIAN fighting.  Tyler walks around the
     perimeter of the circle.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Now nobody was the center of fight
                 club except the two men fighting.
                 The leader walked around in the
                 crowd, out in the darkness.

     Tyler hands ENVELOPES out to the crowd.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Everyone took a homework assignment.

     EXT. STREET - LATE NIGHT

     Ricky and another FIGHT CLUBBER paste up a BILLBOARD which
     reads: "DID YOU KNOW? YOU CAN USE YOUR OLD MOTOR OIL TO

     INT. PAPER STREET HOUSE

     HANDS use a MARKER, writing on a FILE: "Disinformation."

     EXT. LARGE PARKING LOT - DAY

     Jack and Tyler, in work gloves, armed with TOOLS, work
     together to lift the entire METAL PLATE of EXIT SPIKES from
     the ground.  They reverse it, then replace it.

     MOMENTS LATER

     Jack and Tyler walk away, each carrying a 4x4 plank of WOOD.

                             JACK
                 There's fight club in Delaware City.

                             TYLER
                 I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.

     As they pass PARKED CARS, they SWING the planks against
     front bumpers -- activating ALARMS and INFLATING AIR BAGS...

                             JACK
                 Local 8 just started in Penns Grove.
                 And, Bob said he was at fight club in
                 Newcastle last week.

                             TYLER
                 Newcastle?  Did you start that one?

                             JACK
                 I thought you did.

     In the background, a CAR quickly EXITS the parking lot --
     front tires EXPLODING, wheel rims throwing sparks.

     INT. FAMILY HOUSEHOLD -- NIGHT

     FATHER, MOTHER, YOUNG DAUGHTER and SON, eat dinner, watching
     TELEVISION.  Suddenly, the TV IMAGE turns to SNOW and static.

     Family members stop eating.  Father picks up the REMOTE,
     points it -- all channels are SNOW.

     Father turns the TV OFF.  He and his family members look at
     each other, utensils in hand, uncomfortable.

     EXT. CITY ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

     The Yuppie SWINGS a BASEBALL BAT -- DESTROYS a digital
     SATELLITE DISH.  The Yuppie and the Seminarian move on,
     climbing to a neighboring rooftop.  They come upon another
     DISH.  The Seminarian takes the bat, takes a SWING...

     INT. PAPER STREET HOUSE

     HANDS place NEWS CLIPPINGS into a FILE: "Mischief."

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - ON GROUND - DAY

     Two AIRPLANE MAINTENANCE,MEN, with bruised faces, rip open
     a box from a PRINT SHOP.  They dig up AIRPLANE SAFETY

     seatback.  We SEE a CARD - it shows passengers SCREAMING
     and FLAILING ABOUT IN TERROR.

     INT. BUSINESS OFFICE - NIGHT

     Huge office.  Rows and rows of desks.  FIGHT CLUB MEMBERS
     work: one guy moving from COMPUTER MONITOR to COMPUTER
     MONITOR, using a DRILL to drill a hole into the top of each.

     Other guys follow behind, with FUNNELS and CANS of GASOLINE,
     filling each monitor with gasoline.

     EXT. ROOFTOP -- DAY

     The Yuppie crumbles a loaf of stale bread into a bucket,
     stirring it with a big spoon, mixing in a BOTTLE of EX-LAX.

     Nearby, Rob throws handfuls of wet BREADCRUMBS to PIGEONS...
     HUNDREDS of PIGEONS -- a rooftop feeding-frenzy.

     EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

     Tyler and Jack cross the parking lot, towards the
     convenience store.  Jack wears a BACKPACK.

                             TYLER
                 Let me have that a minute...

     Tyler takes the BACKPACK, unzips it, searching the contents.

                             JACK
                 What are we doing?

                             TYLER
                 Homework assignment.

                             JACK
                 What is it?

     Tyler takes out a HANDGUN, hands the backpack back.

                             TYLER
                 Human Sacrifice.

     Jack turns white, staring at the gun.

     EXT. BEHIND THE CONVENIENCE STORE - MOMENTS LATER

     The BACK DOOR opens and Tyler brings the store's CLERK out
     at gunpoint, forces him to his knees.  Jack follows,
     freaked.  Tyler points the gun at the Clerk.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 On a long enough time line, the
                 survival rate for everyone drops to
                 zero.

                             CLERK
                 Please... don't...

                             TYLER
                 Give me your wallet.

     The Clerk fumbles his wallet out of his pocket and Tyler
     snatches it.  Tyler pulls out the DRIVER'S LICENCE.

                             TYLER
                 Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning,
                 apartment A.  A small, cramped
                 basement apartment.

                             RAYMOND
                 How'd you know?

                             TYLER
                 They give basement apartments letters
                 instead of numbers.  Raymond, you're
                 going to die.

     Tyler rummages through the wallet.

                             TYLER
                 Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?

                             RAYMOND
                 Yesssss...

                             TYLER
                 Your mom and dad will have to call
                 kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up
                 your dental records, because there
                 won't be much left of your face.

                             RAYMOND
                 Please, God, no...

     Raymond begins to weep, shoulders heaving.

                             JACK
                 Tyler...

                             TYLER
                 An expired community college student
                 ID card.  What did you used to study,
                 Raymond K. Hessel?

                             RAYMOND
                 S-S-Stuff.

                             TYLER
                 "Stuff."  Were the mid-terms hard?

     Tyler rams the gun barrel against Raymond's temple.

                             TYLER
                 I asked you what you studied.

                             JACK
                 Tell him!

                             RAYMOND
                 Biology, mostly.

                             TYLER
                 Why?

                             RAYMOND
                 I... I don't know...

                             TYLER
                 What did you want to be, Raymond K.
                 Hessel?

     Raymond weeps and says nothing.  Tyler COCKS the gun.
     Raymond GASPS.

                             TYLER
                 The question, Raymond, was "what did
                 you want to be?"

     A beat.

                             JACK
                 Answer him!

                             RAYMOND
                 A veterinarian!

                             TYLER
                 Animals.

                             RAYMOND
                 Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---

                             TYLER
                 Stuff.  That means you have to get
                 more schooling.

                             RAYMOND
                 Too much school.

     Tyler shoves Raymond's wallet back into Raymond's pocket.

                             TYLER
                 Would you rather be dead?

                             RAYMOND
                 No, please, no, God, no!

     Tyler moves the gun right between Raymond's eyes.

                             RAYMOND
                 NOOOOO!

     Tyler UNCOCKS the gun, lowers it.

                             TYLER
                 I'm keeping your license.  I know
                 where you live.  I'm going to check
                 on you.  If you aren't back in school
                 and on your way to being a
                 veterinarian in six weeks, you will
                 be dead.  Get the hell out of here.

     Raymond staggers to his feet, heads down an alleyway.  Jack
     and Tyler watch Raymond flee, then Tyler looks at Jack.

                             JACK
                   I feel sick.

                             TYLER
                   Imagine how he feels.

     Tyler brings the gun to his own head, pulls the trigger --
     CLICK.  Empty.

                             JACK
                 I don't care, that was horrible.

     Tyler walks away.

                             TYLER
                 Tomorrow will be the most beautiful
                 day of Raymond K. Hessell's life.

     Jack watches Tyler go.

                             TYLER
                 His breakfast will taste better than
                 any meal he has ever eaten.

     Jack turns to look the direction Raymond ran.  He finally
     turns back, following after Tyler.

     INT. BUSINESS OFFICE - NIGHT

     SLOW MOTION: in the deserted office, gasoline filled
     COMPUTER MONITORS begin to EXPLODE...BOOM...BOOM...BOOM... !

     EXT. CITY STREETS -- MORNING

     Luxury AUTOMOBILES are parked, splattered with BIRD SHIT.

     EXT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAWN

     VIEWED OUT 3RD STORY WINDOW: Tyler uses a RAKE, dragging it
     across rocks and dirt.  He stops a moment, rake on his
     shoulder, staring off.  Then, back to work...

                             TYLER
                       (muttering quietly)
                 ... You are not how much money you
                 have in the bank.  You are not the
                 shoes you wear.

     Tyler's marking a large SQUARE in the weeds and rubble of
     the backyard, kicking rocks away, dragging the rake...

                             TYLER
                 You are not the contents of your
                 wallet...

     INT. CITY BUS - NIGHT

     The DRIVER has a broken nose.  The bus is empty, except for
     Jack, in the very last seat, sleepy.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 He had a plan.  Maybe you just didn't
                 see it till it hit you between the
                 eyes.
                       (pause)
                 But, it started to make sense... in
                 a Tyler sort of way.  No fear.  No
                 distractions.  The ability to let
                 that which does not matter truly
                 slide.

     EXT. PAPER STREET - NIGHT

     Jack gets off the bus.  As the bus pulls away, we see it
     dropped Jack off right in front of the house.

     INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack enters.  Tyler, dressed in FATIGUES and splattered with
     PAINT, grabs BEERS from the refrigerator.

                             JACK
                 Hey.

                             TYLER
                 Hey.

     Jack notices ROPE and RAPPELLING TOOLS on the table.  Tyler
     comes to hand Jack a bunch of beers, nod to the living room.

                             TYLER
                 Go on in.  We're celebrating.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Jack, bewildered, enters carrying beers.  Tyler does NOT
     follow.  BOB, RICKY and several other fight club guys sit in
     front at the TV, chanting not too loudly, all also dressed
     in FATIGUES and splattered with PAINT.

                             RICKY
                 You are not your job.

                             OTHERS TOGETHER
                 You are not your job.

                             RICKY
                 You are not how much money you have
                 in the bank.

                             BOB
                 Shhhh, wait... they're back to it...

     Bob goes to turn up the TV.  One guy, sixteen years old with
     an angelic face, ANGEL FACE, gets up to take beer from Jack.

                             ANGEL FACE
                       (to Jack)
                 Great, thanks.

     Angel face starts distributing beer amongst his cohorts.

                             BOB
                 Shhhhh!  Watch!

     Jack looks to the TV -- it shows a LIVE shot of the "PARKER
     MORRIS BUILDING."  The building has a GIANT, GRINNING FACE
     PAINTED on it -- two BROKEN WINDOWS for EYES, with flames
     pouring out... FIRETRUCKS spray water.

                             REPORTER (V.O.)
                 Police Commissioner Jacobs has just
                 arrived... just a second... excuse
                 me, Commissioner, could you tell us
                 what you think has happened?

     COMMISSIONER JACOBS, a wrinkled official, turns to camera.

                             COMMISSIONER JACOBS (V.O.)
                 We believe this is related to the
                 recent acts of vandalism around the
                 city.  It's some kind of organized
                 group, and we are coordinating a
                 rigorous investigation.

     Jack turns, sees Tyler in the archway, watching him.  Tyler
     tips his beer to toast, pulls back, out of sight.

                             JACK
                 What did you guys do?

     They all BURST INTO LAUGHTER.  They look at Jack and shake
     their heads.  Jack doesn't get it.  Suddenly, the guys'
     faces turn to stone.  Bob sits rigid.

                             BOB
                 The first rule of Project Mayhem
                 is... you do not ask questions.

     Jack stares at them.

                                                      CUT TO:

     INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT

     A luxurious BANQUET.  Commissioner Jacobs guzzles champagne.
     He rises and starts out of the room.  Jack, in a WAITER'S
     UNIFORM, looks apprehensively to OTHER WAITERS: BOB...
     RICKY... ANGEL FACE -- who all give each other a look.

     INT. HALLWAY

     Jacobs saunters down an empty hall.  He stops to check his
     tie in a mirror.  He pushes open the door of the MEN'S
     BATHROOM -- face to face with TYLER.

     INT. BATHROOM

     Tyler GRABS Commissioner Jacobs, pulling him into the
     bathroom.  He slaps a piece of tape over Jacobs' mouth.  The
     OTHER "WAITERS" rush in.  Jack stays back to keep the door
     shut.  Tyler and the others hold Jacobs, pulling down his
     pants.  Bob snaps a rubber band -- reaches to Jacob s crotch.

                             TYLER
                 Wrap it around the top of his hackie-
                 sack.

                             BOB
                 Man, his balls are ice cold.

     Ricky produces a KNIFE, moves it down to Jacob's testicles.
     Jacobs is bug-eyed.  Jack, red-faced, keeps his distance.

                             TYLER
                 You're not going to continue your
                 "rigorous investigation."  You will
                 publicly state that there is no
                 underground group.  Or -- imagine,
                 the rest of your life with your
                 scrotum flapping empty.

                             JACOBS
                       (mouth taped)
                 ... no... please, no...

                             TYLER
                 We'll send one to the New York Times
                 and one to the Los Angeles Times.
                 Press release style.  Your nuts will
                 be bicoastal.  Understood?  The
                 people you're after are everyone you
                 depend on.
                             (more)

                             TYLER (cont)
                 We do your laundry, cook your food
                 and serve you dinner.  We guard you
                 while you sleep.  We drive your
                 ambulances.  Do not fuck with us.

     Ricky makes a dramatic cut with the knife, causing Jacobs to
     JUMP -- Ricky holds up the severed RUBBER BAND.

     EXT. HOTEL - LATER

     Jack, Tyler and the others file quickly out the back SERVICE
     ENTRANCE.  Tyler gives Angel Face a hearty slap on the back.
     Angel Face smiles at Tyler, nods, grinning.

     Jack sees this, his eyes narrowing, stops walking.

     INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - NIGHT

     Fight club in full swing.  Jack battles Angel Face, BEATING
     the shit out of him with unprecedented viciousness.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I felt like putting a bullet between
                 the eyes of every Panda that wouldn't
                 screw to save its species.

     The crowd shouts maniacally, save Tyler, who watches with an
     inscrutable stone face.

     Angel Face tries to speak, but Jack POUNDS too hard.  Blood
     flies.  The crowd begins to grow QUIETER.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I wanted to open the dump valves on
                 oil tankers and smother all the
                 French beaches I'd never see.

     Finally, Angel Face lies still, unconscious.  Jack stops,
     stares down, numb.  Jack walks away -- the crowd parts to
     let him pass.  Jack scans faces... finds Tyler.

                             TYLER
                 Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?

                             JACK
                 I felt like destroying something
                 beautiful.

     EXT. STREET NEAR LOU'S TAVERN - LATER

     RAINING.  Tyler and Jack walk through pools of streetlight.
     A idling car HONKS.  Tyler leads Jack toward it.  A bruised-
     faced VALET PARKER thrown keys to Tyler, but Jack intercepts.

                             VALET
                 There you are, Mr. Durden.  Airport
                 parking, long term.

                             JACK
                       (motions to car)
                 After you, Mr. Durden...

                             TYLER
                 No... after you.

     INT. STOLEN CAR

     Tyler gets in the driver's seat.  Jack gets into the front
     passenger seat.  Ricky and the mechanic are in back.

     EXT. STREET

     Tyler pulls the stolen car away from the curb.  It has two
     bumperstickers: "RECYCLE YOUR ANIMALS" and "MAKE MINE VEAL."

     INT. STOLEN CAR - MOVING - LATER

     RAIN GUSHES down.  Jack stews, silent.  The car moves down
     a HIGHWAY, intermittently illuminated by oncoming headlights.

                             TYLER
                 Something on your mind?

                             JACK
                 No.

     Tyler shrugs; turns on the RADIO, ignores Jack.

                             JACK
                 Why wasn't I told about "Project
                 Mayhem?"

                             TYLER
                 What should I have told you?

                             JACK
                 Why wasn't I involved from the
                 beginning?  You and I started fight
                 club together.

                             TYLER
                 Fight club was the beginning.  Now
                 it's out of the basements and there's a
                 name for it -- Project Mayhem.

                             RICKY AND MECHANIC
                       (together)
                 The first rule of Project Mayhem is
                 you do not ask questions.

                             JACK
                 This is as much mine as yours.

                             TYLER
                 Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it
                 about you and me?

                             JACK
                 You know what I mean.

                             TYLER
                 What do you want?  A statement of
                 purpose... ?

                             JACK
                 Look...

                             TYLER
                 Should I E-mail you?  Should I put
                 this on your "action item list?"

                             JACK
                 I want to know --

                             TYLER
                 What do you want to know about
                 Project Mayhem?

                             RICKY AND MECHANIC
                       (together)
                 The first rule of Project Mayhem --

                             JACK
                       (to Ricky and Mechanic)
                 Shut up!!
                       (to Tyler)
                 I want to know what's going on.

     Tyler steers the car into the opposite lane, accelerates...
     Opposing HEADLIGHTS get closer fast...

                             TYLER
                 This does not belong to us.  We are
                 not the leaders.  We are not special.

                             JACK
                 What are you doing?!

                             TYLER
                 We are the all-singing, all-dancing
                 crap of the world.  We are all part
                 of the same compost heap...

                             JACK
                 Tyler...

     Tyler steers back into the proper lane.  The other CAR flies
     past, HORN SOUNDING...

                             JACK
                 What the hell ... ?!

                             TYLER
                 You choose your level of involvement.
                 I won't make decisions for you.

                             JACK
                 I'm not asking you to.

                             TYLER
                 You're asking questions that don't
                 have answers.  You know just as much
                 about Project Mayhem as anybody else.

                             JACK
                 I don't think that's true.

     Tyler again steers into the oncoming lane, speeding up.
     Through the windshield: oncoming headlights -- a TRUCK.

                             JACK
                 Tyler... what is this... !

     Jack fights	to turn the wheel, but Tyler uses both hands.

                             TYLER
                 What will you wish you'd done before
                 you died?

                             RICKY
                 Paint a self-portrait.

                             MECHANIC
                 Build a house.

                             TYLER
                       (to Jack)
                 And you?

                             JACK
                 I don't know!  Nothing!

                             TYLER
                 If you died right now, how would you
                 feel about your life?

                             JACK
                 I would feel nothing about my life?
                 Is that what you want to hear?!

     The oncoming truck HONKS and FLASHES its LIGHTS.  It moves
     to the other side of the road.  Tyler steers there, too.

                             TYLER
                 I want to hear the truth.

                             JACK
                 Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck
                 you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of
                 this.  How's that?

                             TYLER
                 Why do you think I blew up your condo?

                             JACK
                 What?

                             TYLER
                 Hitting bottom isn't a weekend
                 retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You
                 have to forget everything you know,
                 everything you think you know --
                 about life, about friendship, about
                 you and me.

     Nearing impact with the oncoming truck, Tyler takes his
     hands off the wheel -- Jack keeps his grip, turns the
     wheel... the car swerves...

     The truck ROARS past, spraying water, HORN BLASTING.

     Tyler looks at Jack, his hands in the air.  Jack looks at
     Tyler with dead eyes.

                             JACK
                 Okay, okay... fine...

     Jack takes his hands off the wheel, holds them in the air.
     Tyler studies Jack face, impressed.  Tyler makes no move to
     take the wheel.

     THROUGH THR WINDSHIELD: a STALLED CAR ahead on the side of
     the road, surrounded by flares.

     Jack and Tyler's eyes stay locked as the car drifts onto the
     shoulder... heading for the stalled car.  Their faces are
     illuminated by the light of the flares.  Tyler smiles.

     They SMASH into the stalled car -- AIRBAGS INFLATE!  The
     back of their car whips around and carries it into a ass-
     over-tea-kettle ROLL down a hill...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I'd never been in a car accident.
                 This must've been what all those
                 statistics felt like before I filed
                 them into my reports.

     The car finally hits the bottom, lying on its roof.

     EXT. OVERTURNED CAR

     Tyler crawls from the passenger side.  He walks around...
     opens the driver's side door and drags Jack out into the
     mud.  Ricky and the Mechanic climb out the broken rear
     window.  Tyler sits beside the stunned, wounded Jack.

                             TYLER
                 We just had a near-life experience.

     INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

     Jack lies in bed, traumatized, eyes empty, staring at the
     ceiling.  Tyler sits in a nearby chair.

                             TYLER
                 In the world I see -- you're stalking
                 elk through the damp canyon forests
                 around the ruins of Rockefeller
                 Center.  You will wear leather
                 clothes that last you the rest of
                 your life.  You will climb the wrist-
                 thick kudzu vines that wrap the Sears
                 Tower.  You will see tiny figures
                 pounding corn and laying-strips of
                 venison on the empty car pool lane of
                 the ruins of a superhighway.

     Tyler stands, gives Jack's head a pat.

                             TYLER
                       (leaving)
                 Feel better, champ.

     INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack sits at the table, sips coffee.  He's pale, dazed,
     seems broken.  He hears the faint SOUND of SAWING and
     HAMMERING, unsure of where it's coming from.

     Marla walks into the kitchen and goes straight to the
     counter.  Her back is to Jack as he looks at her.  She pours
     ccffee and lights a cigarette.  A beat of silence, then:

                             MARLA
                 I'll be out of your way in a sec.

     She seems to be as weak as Jack.

                             JACK
                 You... don't have to... leave.

                             MARLA
                 Whatever.

                             JACK
                 Really... I mean it.
                       (pause)
                 Have you been going to your groups?

                             MARLA
                 Chloe's dead.

                             JACK
                 When?

                             MARLA
                 Do you care?

                             JACK
                 I don't know.

                             MARLA
                 It was the smart move on her part.

     Marla turns to face Jack, a grim expression on her face.
     There's a BRUISE on her ARM.  Jack gets up, moves closer.

                             JACK
                 Why are we both... caught up like
                 this... with... ?

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I came so close to saying Tyler's
                 name, I could feel it vibrate inside
                 my mouth.

     Marla looks a him, waiting.

                             JACK
                 I don't understand.  Why does a weak
                 person have to go out and find a
                 strong person... to hang onto?

                             MARLA
                 What do you get out of it?

     Faint SOUND of SAWING and HAMMERING.  Jack can't quite
     figure where it's coming from.

                             JACK
                 You hear that?

                             MARLA
                 Hear what?

                             JACK
                 That... sawing and hammering.

                             MARLA
                 Have we been talking too long?  Must
                 we change the subject?

     Jack turns -- through the crack of the open basement door,
     Tyler's staring at Jack from the bottom of the stairs.

                             TYLER
                       (harsh whisper)
                 You're not talking about me, are you?

     Jack reacts, turns back to Marla.

                             JACK
                       (to Marla and Tyler)
                 No.

                             MARLA
                 That day you came over to my place to
                 play doctor... what was going on
                 there?

                             TYLER
                       (still a whisper)
                 What are you talking about?

                             JACK
                       (to Marla and Tyler)
                 Nothing.

                             MARLA
                 Nothing?  I don't think so.

                             TYLER
                       (whisper)
                 This conversation...

                             JACK
                 This conversation...

                             TYLER
                 ... is over.

                             JACK
                 ... is over.

     Marla comes to touch Jack's hair.  Jack closes the basement
     door.  Marla sees the kiss-scar on Jack's hand, grabs his
     hand.  Jack tries to pull it back, but Marla keeps a grip.

                             MARLA
                 What is this?  Who did this?

                             JACK
                 ... A person.

                             MARLA
                 Guy or girl?

                             JACK
                 Why would you ask if it's a guy or a
                 girl?!

                             MARLA
                 Why would you get bent if I asked?

                             JACK
                 Let go of me...
                       (pulls his hand free)
                 Leave me alone.

                             MARLA
                 You're afraid to say.

     Marla backs away, closes her eyes, struggling with
     frustration.  She leaves out the back door, not looking back.

     Jack leans against the wall.  After a moment, he opens the
     basement door, heads downstairs...

     INT. BASEMENT STAIRCASE

     Tyler walks upstairs, passing as Jack continues down...

     INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

     Jack looks around.  TRIPLE-DECKER BUNKS clutter the
     basement, as many as can fit into the space.

                             JACK
                       (calling upstairs)
                 Tyler... ?  What's this for?

     From upstairs, the SOUND of the DOORBELL.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack opens the door.  Ricky stands on the porch, staring
     ahead in subordinate military style.  He's in black pants,
     black shirt, black shoes, holds a PAPER BAG, with an army
     surplus MATTRESS rolled-up at his feet.

                             JACK
                 Um... what can I do for you, Ricky?

     Tyler steps up beside Jack, looks Ricky over.

                             TYLER
                 You're too young.  Sorry.

                             JACK
                 Wait a minute...

     Tyler comes back inside, shuts the door.

                             JACK
                 "Too young?"

                             TYLER
                 If the applicant is young, we tell
                 him he's too young.  Old, too old.
                 Fat, too fat.

                             JACK
                 "Applicant?"

                             TYLER
                 If the applicant waits at the door
                 for three days without food, shelter
                 or encouragement, then he can enter
                 and begin training.

                             JACK
                 "Training?"  Tyler...

     EXT. PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack comes out, walks around Ricky, hands in his pockets,
     unsure.  Tyler watches, nods for Jack to go ahead.

                             JACK
                 Uh, look.  You're too... young to...
                 train here.  You should probably be
                 on you way.

     No response from Ricky, who remains at attention.  Jack goes
     back inside.  Tyler closes the door.

     EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

     Ricky remains at attention.  Jack bursts out with a BROOM,
     knocks the brown bag out of Ricky's hand, kicks it away.

                             JACK
                 Are you deaf?!  I told you to leave!
                 You will never get inside this house!

     EXT. PORCH - MORNING

     Ricky's still there.  Tyler comes out, friendly.

                             TYLER
                 Look, friend, I'm sorry for the
                 misunderstanding.  It's not the end
                 of the world.  Just go away.  You're
                 trespassing and I will call the
                 police.  Nothing personal.

     EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

     Ricky, same spot.  Jack bursts outside with the broom again.

                             JACK
                 You're never getting through this
                 door, you stupid little weasel!  Look
                 at me when I talk to you... !

     He WHACKS Ricky in the shoulder with the broom.

                             JACK
                 What is your major malfunction!?

     INT. JACK'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     At the window, Tyler sips coffee, watches this scene on the
     PORCH below.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Sooner or later, we all became what
                 Tyler wanted us to be.

     EXT. PORCH - MORNING

     Ricky's there.  Bob is now next to him, in black, with a
     paper bag in hand, mattress at his feet.  Tyler steps out.
     Jack stays in the doorway, locking eyes on Bob.  To all the
     following questions, Ricky answers "Sir!" --

                             TYLER
                 You have two black shirts?  Two pair
                 black trousers?  One pair black
                 boots?  Two pair black socks?  One
                 black coat?  Three hundred dollars
                 personal burial money?  Go inside.

     Ricky goes in.  Tyler turns to Bob.

                             TYLER
                 You're too old.  Sorry.  And, you're
                 too fat.  Nice seeing you.

     Bob looks genuinely hurt.  He picks up his mattress and
     starts away.  Tyler looks at Jack and rolls his eyes.  Jack
     follows Bob...

                             JACK
                 Bob... Bob, wait...
                       (leading Bob back)
                 Let me explain this to you...

     EXT. PORCH -- NIGHT

     CRICKETS CHIRP.  Bob stands at at rigid attention.

     INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

     Tyler and Jack stand in bathroom doorway, watching Ricky
     finish SHAVING off all of his HAIR.  Tyler comes to give the
     top of Ricky's head a sharp SLAP.

                             TYLER
                 A monkey, ready to be shot into
                 space.  A Space Monkey, ready to
                 sacrifice himself for Project Mayhem.

     From here on, all those with shaved heads: "SPACE MONKEYS."

     EXT. PORCH - DAY

     Jack looks out the window.  Bob stands motionless.  There's
     another "applicant," a SHORT GUY, beside Bob.  Ricky comes
     out the front door with the BROOM...

                             RICKY
                       (to Bob)
                 You're too fucking old, fatty!  We
                 don't want your kind here!
                       (to short guy)
                 You're too short.  Go away, stumpy!
                 Go back to the circus!

     Ricky HITS them with the broom, then goes in, SLAMS THE DOOR.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 So it went...

     EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

     Tyler works with a HALF DOZEN SPACE MONKEYS, preparing the
     square of backyard.  They pull weeds, clear rocks; working
     with shovels, rakes, etc.  They cart away WHEELBARROWS of
     rocks and carry in SACKS of FERTILIZER.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Tyler built his army.

     IN THE KITCHEN WINDOW, Jack watches...

     INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     Jack keeps watching out the window, eats toast.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 To what purpose, might one ask?
                 Well, one might ask, if not for the
                 first rule of Project Mayhem.

     Jack turns to look around the kitchen.  THREE SPACE MONKEYS
     work -- one SCRUBBING the FLOOR, one WASHING DISHES, one
     SCRUBBING the walls.  Jack walks out.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 In Tyler We Trust.

     INT. JACK'S ROOM - DAY

     Jack opens his eyes, awakening to sunlight thru the window.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 And, then...

     INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - DAY

     Jack slowly pushes open the door to Tyler's room...

                             JACK
                 Tyler...

     The room is empty.  Jack stares.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 He was gone.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

     Jack comes downstairs... finds DOZENS of SPACE MONKEYS.

     INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Jack enters.  Space Monkeys render fat and make soap.  They
     pinch HERBS, adding them to the mix.  They add VODKA.  Off
     to the side, a couple Monkeys stir a vat of RICE.  On the
     wall is a big bulletin board with HUNDREDS of DRIVER's
     LICENSES; a sign above it: "HUMAN SACRIFICES."

                             FRECKLED SPACE MONKEY
                 "You are not a beautiful and unique
                 snowflake.  You are the same decaying
                 organic matter as everything else.
                 We are all part of the same compost
                 heap."

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Planet Tyler.

     Jack dips a spoon into the rice, chomps on it irritatingly.

                             FRECKLED SPACE MONKEY
                 "We are the all-singing, all-dancing
                 crap of the world."

     Jack picks up a BOTTLE of VODKA.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I had to hug the walls, trapped
                 inside this clockwork of Space
                 Monkeys, cooking and working and
                 sleeping in teams.

     INT. READING ROOM - NIGHT

     Jack enters, vodka in hand.  TEN SPACE MONKEYS here, reading.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 The house became a living thing, wet
                 inside from so many people sweating
                 and breathing.  So many people
                 moving, the house moved.

     Jack walks out.

     INT. OFFICE - DAY

     Jack enters.  Angel Face reads a book, marks on a chart.
     Space Monkeys shuffle PAPERS and NEWS CLIPPINGS.  Walls are
     lined with FILES, each labeled with a STREET ADDRESS, under
     SIGNS: "Mischief," "Disinformation," "Arson."

     Jack's eye lingers on "Arson." He starts flipping through
     a file.  Angel Face comes to take the file from him.

                             ANGEL FACE
                 That wouldn't interest you.

                             JACK
                 Where's Tyler?

                             ANGEL FACE
                 The first rule of Project --

                             JACK
                 Right, right.

     As Angel Face replaces the file, Jack notices -- a LYE-
     BURNED KISS-SCAR on the back of Angel Face's hand.

     EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT

     Jack takes a swig of vodka, smokes.  In the BACKGROUND, a
     Space Monkey WHACKS an APPLICANT with a BROOM.  It's a
     ritual; no words.  Other Space Monkeys tend the garden.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I'm all alone.  I Am Jack's Broken
                 Heart.

     Jack drops his cigarette in the gravel, steps on it.  A
     Space Monkey immediately comes to clean it up.

                             JACK
                 Get away from me!

                             MARLA'S VOICE (O.S.)
                 Who are all these people?

     Jack turns, sees Marla with an overnight bag.

                             JACK
                 The Paper Street Soap Company.

                             MARLA
                 Can I come in?

                             JACK
                 He's not here.

                             MARLA
                 What?

                             JACK
                 He's not here!  Tyler's not here
                 anymore!  He's gone away!

     Marla stares at Jack, miserable.  A tear runs down her
     cheek.  She turns and walks away.  Jack watches her go.
     There's a LOUD COMMOTION from the house, VOICES SHOUTING.
     Jack heads to the back door...

     INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     Jack enters.  Ricky crawls, bleeding from a gunshot wound to
     the LEG.  Space Monkeys begin a rudimentary job of treating
     the wound.  Other Space Monkeys carry in a DEAD BODY in
     BLACK CLOTHES and SKI MASK, putting it on the table.

                             JACK
                 What's going on?

     Space Monkeys stare at the body.  The Mechanic, sweating,
     gets to his knees and pulls the ski mask off the corpse --
     it's BOB, with a gunshot wound to the HEAD.

                             JACK
                 Bob... oh, Christ...

     Jack pushes past a Space Monkey, stares down, stricken...

                             JACK
                 What... what happened... ?

                             MECHANIC
                       (out of breath)
                 We were on assignment...

     EXT. SCULPTURE PARK - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

     A SCULPTURE adorned with a giant GLOBE on top.

                             MECHANIC (V.O.)
                 We were supposed to kill two birds
                 with one stone:

     A SERIES of EXPLOSIONS blasts the GLOBE free.  It ROLLS...

                             MECHANIC (V.O.)
                 A piece of corporate art...

     The GLOBE ROLLS downhill, to the street -- rolling over one
     parked LUXURY CAR after another, crunching car roofs and
     causing windows to explode...

                             MECHANIC (V.O.)
                 ... and trash a trendy coffee bar.

     Then, the GLOBE arrives at the lobby of a HOTEL...
     BROADSIDES a limo, RICOCHETS... ROLLS directly into the
     front of a closed ARROSTO coffee bar, SMASHING windows...
     DECIMATING coffee push-pats...

     EXT. PARK - AERIAL VIEW - (FLASHBACK CONTINUOUS)

     Bob, the Mechanic and Ricky FLEE, LAUGHING at their
     handiwork.  They split up, running O.S.

                             MECHANIC (V.O.)
                 We had it all worked out, man.  It
                 went smooth... until...

                             HARSH VOICE
                 Police!  Freeze!

     O.S. SOUNDS of GUNSHOTS and FLASHES of MUZZLE FIRE.

     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT - (RESUMING)

     The Mechanic looks up from Bob's corpse.

                             MECHANIC
                 They shot Bob... they shot him in the
                 head.  Those fuckers...

     Jack walks away from Bob's corpse, distraught, holds his
     head, turns to look back, his eyes filling with tears.

                             ANOTHER SPACE MONKEY
                 We gotta do something.

                             RICKY
                 We got to get rid of the evidence.
                 We have to get rid of this body.

                             ANGEL FACE
                 Bury him...

     Jack looks around in disbelief.

                             JACK
                 What... ?

                             ANGEL FACE
                 The garden.  Take him there.  Move,
                 people.  Let's do this!

     Several Space Monkeys gather around Bob's body.

                             JACK
                 No... !

     Space Monkeys stop.  Jack gets between them and Bob, SHOVES
     a few Space Monkeys back...

                             JACK
                 Get your hands off him!  Get off...!
                 What the hell do you think you're
                 doing... ? Evidence?!  This is a
                 man... !  You killed him!

                             ANGEL FACE
                 He was killed in action.

                             JACK
                 No!  Look at you!  You're... you're
                 running around in ski masks,
                 exploding things...

                             ANGEL FACE
                 He was killed serving Project Mayhem.

                             RICKY
                 It's what he would have wanted, sir.

                             JACK
                 What he wanted?  Look... look at him.
                 Look at him!  What does he want?
                       (wipes tears,
                        points at Bob)
                 This is a person.  This is not a cog
                 in your machine...

                             RICKY
                 But, this is Project Mayhem.

                             JACK
                 No, no.  This is a man -- this man
                 has a name...

                             RICKY
                 But, in Project Mayhem, we have no
                 names.

                             JACK
                 No!  Wrong!  This man's name is
                 Robert Paulson.

                             RICKY
                 Robert Paulson?

                             JACK
                 Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead,
                 because of you...

                             MECHANIC
                 I understand.

     Everyone just stares at Jack.

                 In death, a member of Project Mayhem
                 has a name.

                 No -- !

     Jack backs away, surrounded, PUSHES his way out of the room.

     INT. TYLER'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack barges in, goes to the desk, rifling through drawers.
     He finds FLIGHT COUPONS, used and unused.  The used coupons.
     have the flight information, including the destination
     cities.  The PHONE RINGS.  Jack answers it...

                             JACK
                 Tyler?

                 This is Detective Stern of the arson
                 unit.  I'd like to see you in my
                 office tomorrow morning...

     Jack, in a panic, HANGS UP.

     Jack sits stiffly in a seat.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I went to the cities on Tyler's used
                 tickets stubs.

     Jack hurries from the terminal, runs to a TAXI ...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 In every city, I branched out from
                 the airport to downtown, bar-
                 hopping...

     INT. TAXI - IN MOTION, MID-CITY - NIGHT

     Jack's looks out the window, intently watching buildings.

                             JACK (V.0.)
                 I didn't know how or why, but I could
                 look at fifty different bars, and
                 somehow I just knew...

                             JACK
                       (to driver, points)
                 Here.  Let me out, right here...

     INT. BAR - NIGHT

     Jack enters.  He sees several MALE PATRONS with FIGHT
     BRUISES.  Jack moves to the bar.  The BARTENDER has a broken
     arm and swollen face.

                             JACK
                 I'm looking for Tyler Durden.

                             BARTENDER
                 Never heard of him.

                             JACK
                 This is an emergency.  It's important
                 I find him.

                             BARTENDER
                 I wish I could help you... sir.

     Jack RUNS through the airport, lugging his suitcase.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Tyler was setting up franchises, all
                 over the country.

     INT. DRY CLEANERS - DAY

     The PROPRIETOR, his head bandaged, is confronted by Jack.

                             JACK
                 I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't
                 you help me?

                             BANDAGED PROPRIETOR
                 Sir, you're disturbing the other
                 patrons with your laudish behavior.

                             JACK
                       (pointing)
                 There's no one else here.

                             BANDAGED PROPRIETOR
                 I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest
                 idea what you're talking about.

                             JACK
                 Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I
                 just need to know if you've seen
                 Tyler Durden.

                             BANDAGED PROPRIETOR
                 I'm not disclosed to bespeak any such
                 information to you, nor would I, even
                 if I had said information you want,
                 at this juncture be able.

     Jack looks around, incredibly frustrated.

                             JACK
                  You are a moron.

                             BANDAGED PROPRIETOR
                  I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.

     Jack gives up, shoves his way out the door.

     INT. CITY BUS - DAY

     Jack sits on the bus, looking out the window.  The bus stops.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Under and behind and inside
                 everything I took for granted,
                 something horrible had been growing.

     OUT THE WINDOW, a CONSTRUCTION WORKER with a BROKEN NOSE
     works a jackhammer.  He stops, wipes his brow.

     INT. SPORTS BAR - DAY

     TVs show football.  Jack is seated with TWO BRUISED PATRONS.

                             BRUISED PATRON #1
                 No one's ever seen him.  No one knows
                 what he looks like.

                             BRUISED PATRON #2
                 He has facial reconstructive surgery
                 every three years.

                             JACK
                 That's the stupidest thing I've ever
                 heard.

                             BRUISED PATRON #1
                 Is it true about fight club in Miami?

     Jack enters this dark basement, walks ahead in the dim
     light.  The place is damp and empty.  Jack stops, looks down.

                 Everywhere I went, I felt I had

     Jack whirls, startled -- facing the wounded BARTENDER, who
     wears a NECK BRACE, his nose a smashed eggplant.

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER
                 How have you been?

                 Yes... it's a test.

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER
                 You were standing right where you are
                 now, asking how good our security is.
                 It's tight as a drum.

                             JACK
                 Who do you think I am?

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER
                 Is this part of the test?

     Jack nods slowly.  The Bartender holds up his hand, shows
     the KISS SCAR on the back of his hand...

                             WOUNDED BARTENDER
                 You're the one who did this to me.

     Marla answers.

                 Yeah?

                             JACK

                             JACK
                 Because the answer's "yes" or because
                 the answer's "no?"

                             MARLA
                 Is this a trick?

                 Will you just answer me, for
                 Christsake?!

                 we were just having sex or making
                 love?

                             JACK

                             MARLA
                 You fuck me, then snub me.  You love
                 me, you hate me.  You show me your
                 sensitive side, then you turn into a
                 total asshole!  Is that a pretty
                 accurate description of our

                 Say my name.

                             MARLA

                             TYLER
                 Four in Milwaukee.

                             JACK

                 And, we're definitely filling a void
                 in the rural South.

                             JACK
                 Why do people think I'm you?

                             TYLER
                 You broke your promise.  You talked
                 to her about me.

                             JACK
                 Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?

                             TYLER
                 Why did you do that?

                             JACK
                 Answer me, Tyler.

                             TYLER
                 Why do people think anything?

                             JACK
                 I don't know!  Tell me!

     Tyler shakes his head in disgust, extremely irritated.

                             TYLER
                 People think that you're me, because
                 you and I happen to share the same
                 body.

                             JACK
                 What... ?

                             TYLER
                 Is this really news to you?

                 What are you talking about... ?

                 Sometimes I control it, and you
                 imagine yourself watching me...

     FLASHBACK - LOU'S BAR BASEMENT - NIGHT

     JACK stands surrounded by eager fight club MEMBERS, under
     the bare bulb, talking and behaving like Tyler...

                             JACK
                 The first rule of fight club is --
                 you don't talk about fight club.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING

                             TYLER
                 And, sometimes you control it...

     FLASHBACK - EXT. PAPER STREET HOUSE - DAY

     Jack stands in the yard, VODKA in hand, yells at Marla.

                             JACK
                 He's not here!  Tyler's not here
                 anymore!  He's gone away!

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING

                             TYLER
                 You can see me and hear me, but no
                 one else can...

     FLASHBACK - CURBSIDE - NIGHT

     JACK sits alone on the curb, watching the nearby freeway.
     He talks to someone beside him, but nobody's there.

                             JACK
                 Anyone?
                       (thinks)
                 My boss, probably.
                       (pause)
                 Who would you fight?

     Jack listens, looks at the empty space beside him.

                             JACK
                 Oh, yeah.
                       (nodding)
                 I didn't really know my Dad...

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING

                             TYLER
                 But, when you fall asleep, I do
                 things without you...

     FLASHBACK - TYLER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     JACK is on top of Marla, sweating, making violent love...

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING

                             TYLER
                 I go places without you.  Get things
                 done...

     FLASHBACK - BUILDING - NIGHT

     The Parker Morris Building.

     JACK, Bob, Ricky, Angel Face and another GUY rappel down the
     side, SPRAYING PAINT.  JACK is "TYLER" in demeanor,
     mannerisms, speech...

                             JACK
                       (shouting)
                 You are not your job.  You are not
                 how much money you have in the bank.

     TWO WINDOWS SHATTER OUTWARD -- TWO MEN look out and yell:

                             BRUISED MAN #1
                 I am not my job!

                             BRUISED MAN #2
                 I am not how much money I have in the
                 bank!

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING

     Jack's having trouble catching his breath.  Tyler stands.

                             TYLER
                 There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing
                 from you... one simple promise.  Now
                 look what you've done!

                             JACK
                 This isn't possible...

                             TYLER
                 We're going to have to do something
                 about Marla...

                             JACK
                 What... what are you saying?

                             TYLER
                 It's okay.  We okay... a little
                 codependent, sure, but...

     Jack shakes his head in disbelief, in denial...

                             JACK
                 No!  This isn't true.  We... we were
                 around other people, together, both
                 of us...

                                  TYLER
                 You never talked to me in front of
                 anyone else.

                             JACK
                 Wrong, wrong -- what about the car
                 crash... the two guys in the backseat?

                             TYLER
                 What about them?  They're lunatics.

                             JACK
                 You took me to the house.

                             TYLER
                 The house is rented in your name.

                             JACK
                 You have jobs.

                             TYLER
                 Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.

                             JACK
                 What about Marla?

                             TYLER
                 What about Marla?

                             JACK
                 She's... you... you're fucking her.

                             TYLER
                 Um, well... technically, no.

     Jack stands, trying to absorb, feeling ill, trying to find
     words, then -- he suddenly FAINTS to the floor, OUT COLD.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 It's called a "changeover."  The
                 movie goes on, and nobody in the
                 audience has any idea.

     INT. HOTEL ROOM - PRE-DAWN

     Jack's eyes snap open.  He sits up, alone.  He remembers the
     previous night... looks at himself in the mirror... looks at
     the clock -- 4:35am.

     INT. HALLWAY

     The room door SLAMS OPEN as Jack bursts out of the room,
     carrying his suitcase, SPRINTING for the STAIRWELL...

     INT. STAIRWELL

     Jack races down, three steps at a time, dragging his
     suitcase - BOOM, BOOM, BOOM - behind him...

     INT. LOBBY

     Jack hurries to the front door, his suitcase half-broken
     open, passing the front desk.  A DESK CLERK calls after him.

                             DESK CLERK
                 Sir... sir?  Are you checking out?

                             JACK
                 Yes.

     The clerk follows the length of the counter, waves a PAPER.

                             DESK CLERK
                 Please initial this list of phone
                 calls.

                             JACK
                 Bill me!

     Jack goes out the door, freezes.  He rushes back in, going
     to the desk -- snatches the bill, studies it: many NUMBERS.

                             JACK
                 Wait...when were these made?

                             DESK CLERK
                 It says right there, sir... between
                 two and three-thirty this morning.

     Jack looks at the clerk, at the bill, at the clerk.

                             JACK
                 I need a copy of this.

     INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - DAY

     Jack stares out the window, his face set hard.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Had I been going to bed earlier every
                 night?  Have I been sleeping later?
                 Has Tyler been in charge longer and
                 longer?

     EXT. PAPER STREET - DAY

     A TAXI halts.  Jack leaps out, points to the GRUNGY CABBIE.

                             JACK
                 Wait here.

     INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE, LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

     Jack walks in to find the place EMPTY and DESERTED.  He
     continues on into the KITCHEN, gawks at BATHTUBS and
     CANISTERS holding vast amounts of liquid.  There are HOSES,
     GAS MASKS, BEAKERS, TEST TUBES and PUMPS.

     He picks up a BOTTLE labeled "NITRIC ACID."

     INT. TYLER'S ROOM

     Jack sits by the PHONE, pulls out the HOTEL BILL, runs his
     finger up and down the list of PHONE NUMBERS...

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 Deja vu, all over again...

     Jack finger stops on a NUMBER.  He dials, phone to his ear.

                             VOICE
                       (from phone)
                 Eighteen-eighty-eight.

     Jack sees a file on the wall: "1888 CENTURY PARK EAST."

                             JACK
                 Who is this?

                             VOICE
                 Maintenance.

                             JACK
                 Listen, something is going to happen,
                 something terrible...

                             VOICE
                 Very good, Sir.

                             JACK
                 Excuse me?

                             VOICE
                 Don't worry about us, sir.  We're
                 solid.

                             JACK
                 Now wait, there's been a mix-up.
                 Everything's changed...

                             VOICE
                 You told me you'd say that.

                             JACK
                 Abort the plan.

                             VOICE
                 You told me you'd say that, too.

                             JACK
                 Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist
                 dickhead?!

                             VOICE
                 Well, sir, you said you might.

     Jack HANGS UP, desperately dials the next number on the bill.

                             DIFFERENT VOICE
                       (front phone)
                 Twenty-one-sixty.  Maintenance.

     Jack sees a file: "2160 PICO BOULEVARD."  He throws the
     phone, pocketing the bill.  He grabs up all the FILES.

     EXT. MARLA'S HOTEL - SUNSET

     Jack's TAXI halts.  Marla walks out of the lobby doors, sees
     Jack getting out of the cab, laden with files...

                             JACK
                 Marla!

     Marla makes a sharp turn, walking away.  Jack follows,
     hugging the files to his chest, catching up.

                             JACK
                 Marla...

                             MARLA
                 Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me
                 with a fucking broom.  I thought they
                 were going to break my arm.

                             JACK
                 I'm sorry, I...

                             MARLA
                 The were burning their fingertips
                 with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.

                             JACK
                 Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's
                 going to take a tremendous act of
                 faith on your part for you to hear me
                 out.

                             MARLA
                 Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.

     Marla heads into a DINER.  Jack follows...

                             JACK
                 -- A little more faith than that.

     INT. DINER - MOMENTS LATER

     Marla sits in a BOOTH.  Jack sits across from her.

                             MARLA
                 I don't want to hear anything you've
                 got to say.

                             JACK
                 Give me a minute, Marla, alright...
                 just sixty seconds.

                             MARLA
                 Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.

                             JACK
                 Absolutely, you have every right.  I
                 need you to do me a favor.

                             MARLA
                 I've done you enough favors.

     A WAITER with a BLACK EYE appears at the table.

                             WAITER
                 Sir!  Anything you order is free of
                 charge, sir.

                             MARLA
                 Why is it free of charge?

                             JACK
                 Because... I'm Tyler Durden.

                             MARLA
                 Then, I'll have the clam chowder...
                 fried chicken and a baked potato with
                 everything and a chocolate chiffon
                 pie.

     Jack look to the pass-through WINDOW into the kitchen where
     THREE COOKS look out with STITCHES in their faces.

                             JACK
                 Clean food, please.

                             WAITER
                 In that case, sir, may I advise
                 against the lady eating the clam
                 chowder?

                             JACK
                 Thanks, no clam chowder.  That's it.

     The waiter snaps to attention and leaves.

                             MARLA
                 You got about thirty seconds.

                             JACK
                       (takes a deep breath)
                 I know that I've been... unwell.  I
                 know it's been like there's two sides
                 to me.

                             MARLA
                 Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr.
                 Jackass.

                             JACK
                 I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've
                 only just realized

                             MARLA
                 What?

                             JACK
                 I mean, the depth and breadth of our
                 relationship has only recently been
                 illuminated for me.  I know this...
                 I know us hasn't been such a great
                 thing for you...

                             MARLA
                 Whatever.
                       (to waiter)
                 I'll take my food to go...

     Marla's getting up to go, but Jack rises, fed up, takes her
     by the arm, putting her back in her seat.

                             JACK
                 Sit down!  Sit down and give me my
                 last fifteen seconds without opening
                 your mouth!

     Marla crosses her arms.  Jack collects himself.

                             JACK
                 I'm trying to tell you -- and this is
                 where you have to trust me -- but, I
                 think your life might be in real
                 danger.

                             MARLA
                 What?

                             JACK
                 You have to get out of here.  Leave
                 as soon as possible.  Go to any rural
                 town, away from any major city...

                             MARLA
                 You are an insane person.

                             JACK
                 Marla...

                             MARLA
                 No, no, shut up!  I've had enough.
                 I tried, Tyler... I have tried...

     Marla's getting upset, tears coming to her eyes.

                             MARLA
                 There's a part of you I really like,
                 but I can't do this anymore.  I just
                 can't.  This is killing me...

                             JACK
                 I'm sorry, but I...

                             MARLA
                 What?!  You're sorry?  I don't
                 believe that for a minute.

     Marla gets up.  Jack grabs for her, but she's gone, heading
     for the door.  Jack gathers his files, runs to follow...

     EXT. DINER - MOMESTS LATER

     Jack pushes out the door, files under one arm, catching up...

                             JACK
                 I can't explain.  You wouldn't
                 believe me anyway.  I'm trying to
                 protect you...

     Jack grabs her arm, tries to hail a TAXI, but the taxi races
     past.  Marla pulls free, screaming at him...,

                             MARLA
                 Let go of me!

                             JACK
                 Do this for me, Marla.  Do this for
                 me, if you never do anything else...

     Jack spots a BUS idling further up the street.

                             MARLA
                 Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to
                 see you again!

                             JACK
                 Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll
                 never have to see me again.
                       (digs in his pocket)
                 Here... here...

     He pulls MONEY from his pocket, holding it out.

                             JACK
                 Take this money, get on this bus...
                       (pointing to bus)
                 Get on, and I promise you, I'll never
                 bother you again, if that's what you
                 want.  Please...

     Marla looks at Jack, numb.

                             MARLA
                 Tyler...

                             JACK
                 I'm begging you.  Get on the bus.
                 Get on the bus.

     Marla takes the money from Tyler, walks towards the bus.  As
     they approach it, Jack shields his eyes, afraid to look...

                             MARLA
                 Why are you doing this?

                             JACK
                 I can't let myself see where you're
                 going.  Go wherever it takes you,
                 remember... keep away from major
                 cities...

     Marla stands at the doors of the bus, heartbroken, gives one
     last look at Jack.

                             MARLA
                       (holds up the money)
                 I'm not paying this back.  I consider
                 it "asshole tax."

                             JACK
                 Yes, fine.  Just, get on.  Stay away
                 a couple of weeks, at least.

     Jack's still covering his eyes.  Marla gets on the bus.

                             MARLA
                 Tyler...

     Jack finally looks to her.

                             MARLA
                 You are the worst thing that ever
                 happened to me.

     DOORS HISS SHUT.  The BUS LEAVES, heading away.  Jack seems
     relieved.  Then, a SCREAM is HEARD from MARLA...

     Jack turns, looks... THROUGH THE BUS WINDOWS: the bus is
     filled with BALD MEN IN BLACK: Space Monkeys.

     Jack SPRINTS after the bus...

     The bus speeds away.  Onboard, Space Monkeys subdue Marla.

     Jack falls to the asphalt, rolls, files-flying.

                             JACK
                 Son of a bitch!

     INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

     Jack RUNS to the front desk, crazed, dumps the armload of
     files on the desk in front of the DESK SERGEANT...

                             JACK
                       (loudly)
                 I want you to arrest me.  I'm the
                 leader of a terrorist organization
                 responsible for acts of vandalism all
                 over the city.  Detective Stern in
                 arson knows who I am...

     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

     Detective Stern and THREE DETECTIVES stand, staring at Jack,
     who's seated.  On the table are the phone bill and files.

                             JACK
                 There are probably several hundred
                 members in the metropolitan area.
                 Chapters are sprouting in at least
                 five other major cities.  They're
                 tightly-regimented, with many cells
                 capable of operating without a
                 central leader.  Check this address:
                 1537 Paper Street.  You'll find the
                 body of Robert Paulson buried in the
                 garden.  You'll also find numerous
                 tubs used to make gallons of
                 nitroglycerin.  The plan, I believe,
                 is to blow up these credit card
                 headquarters and the TRW building.

                             STERN
                 Why these buildings?

                             JACK
                 You are not your job.  You are not
                 how much money you have in the bank.

                             STERN
                       (to other detectives)
                 Keep him talking.

     Stern leaves.  A beat, then, the remaining Detectives smile
     at Jack with REVERENCE.

                             FLAT-TOP DETECTIVE
                 I really admire what you're doing.
                 You're a brave man to order this.

                             JACK
                 What?

                             REDHEAD DETECTIVE
                 You're a genius, sir.

     They grab Jack and force him on his back on the table.
     Flat-Top has a rubber band; the Bald Detective has a knife.

                             BALD DETECTIVE
                 You know the drill.  You said if
                 anyone ever tries to interfere with
                 Project Mayhem, even you, we got to
                 get his balls.

     Flat-Top PULLS Jack's pants completely off, tosses them
     aside.  Jack SCREAMS.  Flat-Top holds his legs.

                             FLAT-TOP
                 It's useless to fight.

                             REDHEAD
                 This is really a powerful gesture,
                 Mr. Durden.  It'll set quite an
                 example.

                             JACK
                 No... you're making a mistake!

                             FLAT-TOP
                 You told us you'd say that.

                             JACK
                 I'm not Tyler Durden!

                             BALDY
                 You told us you'd say that, too.

                             JACK
                 Okay, I am Tyler Durden and I'm
                 ordering you to abort the mission!

                             FLAT-TOP
                 You said you would definitely say
                 that.

                             BALDY
                 What's our best time for a "cut and
                 run?"

                             FLAT-TOP
                 Four minutes.

                             BALDY
                 Is somebody timing this?

                             REDHEAD
                       (looks at his watch)
                 Wait till the second hand gets to the
                 twelve.

     A KNOCK at the door.  Flat-Top slaps a hand over Jack's
     mouth.  He and Redhead block view of the table as Baldy
     opens the door a crack.  Stern mutters:

                             STERN
                 Some of this info checks out.  Let's
                 go to the place on Paper Street.

     Baldy glances back at the other Detectives, leaves, closing
     the door.  The two remaining Detectives continue.  Jack kicks
     and screams and writhes.  The Detectives wrangle him, but
     with more difficulty, now that Baldy's gone.

                             REDHEAD
                       (checking his watch)
                 Mr. Durden, you're going to fuck up
                 the time!

     Jack gets one leg free, KICKS, knocks Flat-top backwards --
     Flat-Top SLAMS the wall, falls.  Redhead lets go of one of
     Jack's arms, jams his elbow into Jack's throat... cutting
     off the airway.  Jack's face reddens... he's choking...

     Jack's free hand reaches, searching.. pulls Redhead's GUN
     and points it at him.  Redhead backs off. Jack gets up,
     gasping for air, PISTOL-WHIPS Flat-top as he rises.

     Jack grabs one of the files off the table.

     EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

     Jack, without pants, in BOXER SHORTS, escapes out the BACK
     DOOR.  He looks at the ADDRESS on the file folder.

     EXT. STREET

     Jack SPRINTS down the middle of the street, gun in hand,
     looking like a complete madman.  Cars almost hit him.

     EXT. BANK BUILDING - LATER

     Jack, sweating and panting, stops, looks... then heads
     toward the BUILDING with the address "1888."

     EXT. 1888 LOBBY

     Jack tries the door.  Locked.  He lifts a cast iron bench,
     runs forward -- RAMS it into the glass.  The bench
     immediately recoils from the glass, SLAMS Jack's groin!
     Jack falls to his knees, doubled over, holding his package.
     Then, he rises, SHOOTS the glass...

     INT. 1888 LOBBY

     Jack pushes through the broken glass.  He sprints for the
     "PARKING" door...

     INT. GROUND LEVEL - PARKING

     Jack enters, looks -- NO CARS.  He bolts to the STAIRS...

     INT. TOP-LEVEL PARKING AREA - SEVENTH FLOOR

     Jack enters, heaving.  Again, NO CARS.  He moves from one
     SUPPORT POST to another, searching.  He finally spies,
     across the garage, NINE LARGE CANISTERS, heavily-WIRED.

     Jack runs to the BOMB, frantic.  He walks around it.
     There's a DIGITAL CLOCK, ticking down from "10:05"...

     Jack moves to pull the lid off one CANISTER, looks inside..

                             TYLER
                 Could be worse...

     Jack looks -- Tyler's seated, his back against one post.

                             TYLER
                 You could be standing under 37
                 stories of steel and concrete with a
                 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped
                 to the support... oh, maybe it
                 couldn't be...

                             JACK
                       (points at bomb)
                 You... you can't be serious about
                 this.

                             TYLER
                 What a ridiculous thing to say.

                             JACK
                 I can't let you...

                             TYLER
                              ...go through with this?
                 What are you going to do?

                             JACK
                 I'm going to...

                             TYLER
                           ...stop me?

                             JACK
                 I'm not going...

                             TYLER
                            ...to let this happen!

                             JACK
                 Stop finishing...

                             TYLER
                         ...your sentences!  They're
                 our sentences.  Get your mind around
                 that.

     Tyler gets up walks to Jack.

                             TYLER
                 What are you doing running through
                 the streets in your underpants?  We
                 both use that body.

                             JACK
                 Since when is Project Mayhem about
                 murder?

                             TYLER
                 The buildings were evacuated thirty
                 minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding
                 exactly as planned.

                             JACK
                 You don't know that.  There could
                 still be people inside.

     Tyler keeps walking around, crosses his arms.

                             TYLER
                 Maybe.  Maybe a couple of guys with
                 shaved heads couldn't synchronize
                 their watches.  Good riddance.

     Jack looks back to the BOMB, goes to it, wipes sweat off his
     face.  He starts finger the MANY WIRES, sorting them.

                             TYLER
                 I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you
                 know which wires, in what order...

                             JACK
                 If you know, I know.

     Jack holds his gun under one armpit, uses both hands to go
     through the tangle of colored wires.

                             TYLER
                 Or... maybe I knew you'd know, so I
                 spent the whole day thinking about
                 the wrong ones.

     Jack chooses one wire, GREEN, holds it in his fingers.

                             JACK
                 If I'm wrong, we're both dead..

                             TYLER
                 This is not about martyrdom.

     Jack twists the GREEN WIRE around his finger.

                             JACK
                 I'm pulling the green wire.

                             TYLER
                 Green?  Did you say green?

     Tyler comes a little closer, leaning to try to get a look,
     seems genuinely concerned.

                             JACK
                 Yes...

                             TYLER
                 Don't pull the green wire.  Pull
                 anything but the green wire.

                             JACK
                 Fuck you.

                             TYLER
                 I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.

     Jack's unsure, swallowing, pulling the wire taunt, fingers
     trembling.  The SOUND of a VEHICLE is HEARD from below...

                             TYLER
                 Hear that?  Marla's here.  Just in
                 the nick of time, eh?

     Jack looks to Tyler.  Tyler points towards the SOUND...

                             TYLER
                 See for yourself.

     Jack releases the wire, walks to a RAILING, gun in hand,
     keeps an eye on Tyler.  Jack looks over the railing...

     BELOW, a BUS idles.  The doors open and MARLA'S dragged out,
     kicking and screaming, carried by SIX SPACE MONKEYS...

                             MARLA
                 You motherfuckers...

     They carry Marla into the BUILDING'S ENTRANCE.

     Jack leans against the railing, exhausted.

                             TYLER
                 I've got everything.  The bombs.  The
                 army.  I've got Marla.

                             JACK
                 Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew
                 a hole in his head.  Was that part of
                 your plan?

     Tyler thinks, shrugs.

                             TYLER
                 Bob was a grown man.  In any great
                 struggle, there will be casualties.
                 Wouldn't that be implicit in the
                 name?  Project "Mayhem."

                             JACK
                 Fuck your struggle.  I want out.

                             TYLER
                 You want out?

                             JACK
                 I quit.

                             TYLER
                 Not an option, for the most obvious
                 of reasons.  You need to get with the
                 program.
                       (looks at his watch)
                 Seven minutes.  Let's get out of here.

     Tyler's walks away.  Jack looks at the gun in his hand.  He
     points the gun at Tyler...

                             JACK
                 Tyler...

                             TYLER
                       (still walking away)
                 What?

                             JACK
                       (COCKS the gun)
                 Defuse the bomb.

     Tyler stops walking.

                             TYLER
                 Ask me nicely.

                             JACK
                 Defuse the bomb, please.

                             TYLER
                 Defuse the bomb?

                             JACK
                 Yes.

     Tyler strides towards the BOMB.  Jack trains the gun...

                             JACK
                 Please.

     Tyler looks at the BOMB, reaches over to it.  He grips the
     GREEN WIRE, yanks it out -- the CLOCK STOPS.

     Jack lowers his gun.

                             TYLER
                 I did that for you.  As a gesture.
                 Now, how fast can you run?  There are
                 ten other bombs, in ten other
                 buildings in the immediate area.  If
                 you're going to get them all, you
                 better get cracking.
                       (looks at watch)
                 Six minutes.  Green wires, remember.
                 I'll be upstairs.

     Jack's stunned.  Tyler walks across the parking garage, past
     Jack, heading for the STAIRS.

     Jack aims the gun at Tyler's back, FIRES!

     Tyler ducks to one side, impossibly quick, avoiding...

     Tyler spins to face Jack.

                             TYLER
                 Whoa!  What was that all about?

     Jack aims... FIRES!

     Tyler DODGES behind a post as the BULLET THROWS CONCRETE.

     Jack edges forward, gun held in both hands, moves around the
     post... Tyler is NOT THERE.  Jack turns, takes slow steps,
     moving the gun from side to side...

     Suddenly, a FIST ENTERS FRAME -- SLUGS Jack's face.

     Jack falls.  The gun goes CLATTERING across the floor...

     Jack turns, looking... Tyler's GONE.  Jack looks to the gun,
     scrambles to his feet, running to pick up the gun...

     Tyler KICKS Jack in the chest, sends Jack sprawling.

     Jack rolls, holding his chest.  He looks up, sees Tyler run
     into the STAIRWELL.  Jack grabs the gun and follows...

     INT. STAIRWELL

     Jack smashes the door open.  The stairwell's empty.  Jack
     RUNS up a flight of stairs, kicks open ANOTHER DOOR...

     INT. MAIN LOBBY

     Jack steps forward, gun up... TWO INTERLOCKED HANDS SLAM
     down onto his head.  Jack drops to the floor.

     Tyler backs away, laughing.  Jack gets to his feet, aims his
     gun...

                             TYLER
                 Fire at will.

     Jack clenches his teeth, FIRING -- nothing happens to Tyler.
     Jack FIRES TWICE -- no effect.  Tyler raises his arms.

                             TYLER
                 What did you expect?

     Jack charges.  Tyler dodges, PUNCHES, knocks the gun out of
     Jack's hand.  They FIGHT, trading PUNCHES, grappling, taking
     each other to the floor...

                                                      CUT TO:

     INT. SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

     Banks of SECURITY MONITORS sit unmanned.

     ON ONE MONITOR: Jack is seen in the lobby, on the floor,
     alone, wrestling himself.  He swings his left hand up,
     punching empty air, then swings his right hand -- PUNCHING
     himself in the side of the head...

     INT. MAIN LOBBY

     Tyler and Jack fight viciously, bloodied.  Tyler manages to
     get his hands around Jack's throat, starts BANGING Jack's
     head against the floor...

     SECURITY MONITOR P.O.V.

     ... Jack's got his hands around his own throat, BANGING his
     own head against the floor, over and over...

     INT. MAIN LOBBY

     Jack manages to break Tyler's grip, KICKS Tyler away.
     Tyler springs to his feet, RUNS, heading for a STAIRCASE.

     Jack gets up, breathing hard, holding his head, follows...

     ON THE STAIRS, Tyler reaches the LOFT LEVEL, above the
     lobby, disappears around a corner.  Jack's right behind,
     turning the corner -- Tyler's NOT THERE.

     Jack receives a SHARP SLAP on the back of the head.  He
     wheels.  Tyler isn't there.  A TAP on his shoulder.  Jack
     turns around -- WHAM! -- Tyler PUNCHES his face.  Jack falls
     against the loft railing.  Tyler comes forward, SWINGS...

     SECURITY MONITOR P.O.V.

     Jack PUNCHES himself square in the nose!

     INT. MAIN LOBBY

     Jack's dazed.  Tyler grabs Jack's shirt, pulls him forward,
     SWINGS HIM -- THROWS him DOWN THE STAIRS...

     Jack TUMBLES horribly down... HITS BOTTOM, striking his head
     on the floor.  Jack PASSES OUT...

                                                     FADE TO BLACK:

     INT. LARGE SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR

     CLOSE ON: Jack's head jerks back as he SNAPS AWAKE.  He
     looks around, trying to focus his eyes...

     JACK'S P.O.V. -- TRACKS in the sawdust of the floor, from
     where his body was dragged across to where he is how.

     CLOSE ON: Jack tries to comprehend.  He turns his head --
     TYLER'S HAND brings the GUN up, PUTS THE GUN IN JACK'S
     MOUTH.  Jack freezes, looks around with his eyes...

                                                      PULL BACK TO:

     Tyler is seated in Jack's lap.  Tyler holds the gun in
     Jack's mouth, his arm around him.  This huge room is being
     remodeled.  Tyler and Jack are seated near floor-to-ceiling
     windows affording a spectacular view of the CITY.

     Tyler looks at his watch.

                             TYLER
                 One minute.

                             JACK (V.O.)
                 I think this is about where we came
                 in.

                             TYLER
                       (looking out window)
                 This is the beginning.  We're at
                 ground zero.  Maybe you should say a
                 few words, to mark the occasion.

                             JACK
                 i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...

     Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.

                             JACK
                       (still distorted)
                 I still can't think of anything.

     Tyler checks his watch.

                             TYLER
                 It's getting exciting now.

     Jack turns, so he can see down -- 31 STORIES.

                             TYLER
                 Look what we've accomplished.
                       (checks watch)
                 Thirty seconds.
                       (looks out windows)
                 Out these windows, we will view the
                 economic collapse.  One step closer
                 to global equilibrium.  I'm glad
                 you're here with me.

     Tyler watches the skyline, WHISTLES at tune, waiting.

                             JACK
                       (distorted)
                 Can't you call it off... ?

                             TYLER
                 It's out of our hands.
                       (looks at watch)
                 This is it.

                             JACK
                 Please...

                             TYLER
                 Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see
                 alright?  10... 9... 8....

     Tyler looks out the windows, at SURROUNDING BUILDINGS,
     excited.  Jack closes his eyes, despairing.

                             TYLER
                 5... 4... 3... 2...

     Out the window, the SKYLINE remains unchanged.  Nothing.  A
     long beat.  A very dark scowl comes over Tyler's face.

     Jack opens his eyes.  More waiting.  Tyler looks genuinely
     surprised, pissed-off.

                             TYLER
                 What the fuck -- ?

                             JACK
                 Paraffin.

                             TYLER
                 What?

                             JACK
                       (relieved)
                 Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the
                 nitro with paraffin.  I saw it
                 floating in the bomb.
                             (more)

                             JACK (cont)
                 They must've run out of cotton and
                 Epsom salt.  Paraffin is iffy at best.

     Tyler rises, taking the gun from Jack's mouth, starts
     pacing.  Jack rubs his sore jowls, allows himself a smile.

                             TYLER
                 Damn it!  God-damn it...

                             JACK
                 Not exactly according to plan.

                             TYLER
                 Do we have to do everything
                 ourselves?!

     Tyler stops walking, lets out a sigh of disgust.  He reaches
     into his pocket, taking out a WALKIE TALKIE.

                             TYLER
                       (into WALKIE TALKIE)
                 ... Codename Rooster.  Passcode First
                 Strike...

     Jack's eyes go wide.

                             JACK
                 NO...

                             TYLER
                       (into WALKIE TALKIE)
                 Proceed with remote detonation.

     Jack leaps -- TACKLES Tyler.  The GUN is knocked away.  Jack
     STRIKES Tyler's face repeatedly with his elbow, scrambles
     off...

     Jack gets the gun, turns, pointing it.  Tyler's getting to
     his feet, sees the gun, annoyed.  Jack stands.

                             TYLER
                 Haven't we already done this?

     Jack SHOOTS TWICE.  Bullets pass right thorough Tyler.
     Tyler just rolls his eyes, drops the walkie-talkie to the
     floor and STOMPS on it, CRUSHING it.

                             JACK
                       (pointing)
                 How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking
                 figment of my imagination... you're
                 psychogenic fugue state...

                             TYLER
                 Fuck that, maybe you're my
                 hallucination.

     Jack falters, pointing at Tyler's feet.  There's no walkie-
     talkie there.  Jack looks down, sees the WALKIE-TALKIE
     CRUSHED under his own foot.

                             JACK
                 Oh... Christ...

     Jack holds his head, walks around, at his wit's end.

                             JACK
                 Why... why... why... ?

                             TYLER
                 Why what?

                             JACK
                 Why can't I get rid of you?  Why
                 can't I just wish you away?

                             TYLER
                 You need me.

                             JACK
                 No, no, I don't.
                       (pause)
                 I thank you, I really do.  Thank you,
                 but I don't need you anymore.

                             TYLER
                 Look, I can be selfish, I know that.
                       (pause)
                 I'm not blind to my own failings...

                             JACK
                 Noooo, please...

     Jack backs up against a window, numb and weary.

                             TYLER
                 From now on, we'll share Marla.
                 We've been spending too much time
                 apart...

                             JACK
                 ... no, no, no...

                             TYLER
                 No more running off without you.
                 From here on out, we do it together.

                             JACK
                 Why are you doing this?!

                             TYLER
                 I'm doing this for us.

                             JACK
                 Please understand... I've gotten all
                 I can from this, Tyler.

                             TYLER
                       (sullen)
                 If I leave, you will be right back
                 where I found you...

                             JACK
                 I swear on my life, I won't...

                             TYLER
                 You will.  You know you will.

     Jack stares at Tyler, tears welling up, hangs his head.  He
     looks at the gun in his hand...

                             TYLER
                 Can you live with that?

     Jack stares at the gun a long time... then...

     Jack brings the gun up, PUTS THE GUN IN HIS MOUTH.

     Tyler cocks his head.

                             TYLER
                 What are you doing?

                             JACK
                 What have you left for me?

                             TYLER
                 Why do you want to do that? Why do
                 you want to put that gun in your
                 mouth?

                             JACK
                 Not my mouth.  Our mouth.

     Tyler is calm.

                             TYLER
                 This is interesting.

     Tyler smiles in appreciation, slowly walks forward, stands
     very close to Jack.

                             TYLER
                 Why are you going with this, Ikea-
                 boy?

                             JACK
                 It's the only way to get rid of you...

     Jack COCKS the hammer on the gun.

                             TYLER
                 I can see you feel very strongly.  I
                 feel strongly too.
                       (pause)
                 Hey, you and me.
                       (pause)
                 Friends again?

     Their eyes are locked, unblinking.  Long silence.

                             JACK
                 Do something for me.

                             TYLER
                 What?

                             JACK
                 Appreciate something.

                             TYLER
                 What?

                             JACK
                 Look at me...

                             TYLER
                 What?

                             JACK
                 My eyes are open.

     EXTREME SLOW MOTION:

     Jack's finger squeezes the trigger...

     KABLAM! -- Jack's cheeks INFLATE with gas.  His eyes bulge.
     BLOOD flies out from his head.  The WINDOW behind him
     SHATTERS.  SMOKE wafts out of his mouth and tear ducts.

     RESUME NORMAL SPEED as the GLASS FALLS behind Jack...

     Tyler stands, in gunsmoke, eyes glazed, sniffs the air...

                             TYLER
                 What's that smell... ?

     Jack slumps to the floor... Tyler falls...

     Tyler hits the ground.  The back of TYLER'S HEAD is BLOWN
     OPEN, revealing blood, skull and brain.

     Suddenly, a GROUP of SPACE MONKEYS burst into the room,
     moving forward to Jack.  TYLER'S BODY IS GONE.

                             TALL SPACE MONKEY
                 Are you all right, sir... ?!

     Jack quakes, holding the side of his head; a ragged hole
     blown in his CHEEK.  He's bleeding hard, but he's alive.

                             JACK
                 I'm okay...

     Jack looks to the Space Monkeys, trying to get his eyes to
     see.  TWO SPACE MONKEYS enter with Marla.  One holds a gun
     to Marla as she struggles.

                             SHORT SPACE MONKEY
                 Are you sure?  You look terrible,
                 sir!  What's happened?

                             JACK
                 Everything's fine.

                             ANOTHER SPACE MONKEY
                 Sir, you look really awful!  Do you
                 need medical assistance?

     Jack sees Marla, tries to get to his feet, falls...

                             JACK
                 Bring the girl to me.  The rest of
                 you get out.  Now!

     The Monkeys bring Marla, releasing her, saluting.

                             MARLA
                 What happened... ?

                             JACK
                 Don't ask.

     Marla crouches, takes out wadded TISSUES and tries to apply.
     them to Jack's wound.  Space Monkeys are leaving, hesitantly.

                             JACK
                 Get to the rendezvous point.  Move it!

     Jack and Marla are left alone.

                             MARLA
                 My God, you're shot...

                             JACK
                 Yes.

     Jack tries to got up.  Marla helps him.

                             MARLA
                 Who did this to you?

                             JACK
                 I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm
                 fine...

     MASSIVE EXPLOSION... the glass walls rattle...

     Jack and Marla look -- OUT THE WINDOWS: a BUILDING EXPLODES;
     collapsing upon itself.  Then, ANOTHER BUILDING IMPLODES
     into a massive cloud of dust.  Jack and Marla are
     silhouetted against the SKYLINE.  Jack looks to Marla,
     reaches to take her hand.

                             JACK
                 I'm sorry... you met me at a very
                 strange time in my life.

     Marla looks at him.  ANOTHER BUILDING IMPLODES and COLLAPSES
     inward... and ANOTHER BUILDING... and ANOTHER...

     The FILM SLOWS, then ADVANCES ONE FRAME at a TIME -- SHOWING
     SPROCKET HOLES on the SIDES.  EACH FRAME is an IMPLODING
     BUILDING -- then, ONE FRAME IS A PENIS.  Then, the IMPLODING
     BUILDING again.  SPEED UP the frames, LOSE the sprocket
     holes, RESUME NORMAL SPEED...

                                                     FADE TO BLACK:

                                                end

                                            SHOOTING SCRIPT
  FADE IN:

  DAWN. CRASHING SURF.

  The waves TOSS a BEARDED MAN onto wet sand. He lies there.

  A CHILD'S SHOUT makes him LIFT his head to see: a LITTLE
  BLONDE BOY crouching, back towards us, watching the tide eat
  a SANDCASTLE. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the boy. The Bearded
  Man tries to call them, but they RUN OFF, FACES UNSEEN. He
  COLLAPSES.

  The barrel of a rifle ROLLS the Bearded Man onto his back. A
  JAPANESE SECURITY GUARD looks down at him, then calls up the
  beach to a colleague leaning against a JEEP. Behind them is a
  cliff, and on top of that, a JAPANESE CASTLE.

  INT. ELEGANT DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - LATER

  The Security Guard waits as an ATTENDANT speaks to an ELDERLY
  JAPANESE MAN sitting at the dining table, back to us.

                     ATTENDANT
               (in Japanese)
           He was delirious. But he asked for
           you by name. And...
               (to the Security Guard)
           Show him.

                     SECURITY GUARD
               (in Japanese)
           He was carrying nothing but this...

  He puts a HANDGUN on the table. The Elderly Man keeps eating.

                     SECURITY GUARD
           ...and this.

  The Security Guard places a SMALL PEWTER CONE alongside the
  gun. The Elderly Man STOPS eating. Picks up the cone.

                     ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
               (in Japanese)
           Bring him here. And some food.

  INT. SAME - MOMENTS LATER

  The Elderly Man watches the Bearded Man WOLF down his food.
  He SLIDES the handgun down the table towards him.

                     ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
               (in English)
           Are you here to kill me?

  The Bearded Man glances up at him, then back to his food.
                                                          2.

  The Elderly Japanese Man picks up the cone between thumb and
  forefinger.

                    ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
          I know what this is.

  He SPINS it onto a table- it CIRCLES gracefully across the
  polished ebony... a SPINNING TOP.

                    ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
          I've seen one before. Many, many
          years ago...

  The Elderly Japanese Man STARES at the top mesmerized.

                    ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
          It belonged to a man I met in a
          half-remembered dream...

  MOVE IN on the GRACEFULLY SPINNING TOP...

                     ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
          A man possessed of some radical
          notions...

The Elderly Japanese Man STARES, remembering...

                    COBB (V.O.)
          What's the most resilient parasite?

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. SAME ELEGANT DINING ROOM - NIGHT (YEARS EARLIER)

The speaker, COBB, is 35, handsome, tailored. A young
Japanese man, SAITO, eats as he listens.

                    COBB
          A bacteria? A virus?

Cobb gestures at their feast with his wine glass-

                    COBB
          An intestinal worm?

Saito's fork pauses, mid-air. Cobb GRINS. A third man is at
the table- ARTHUR. He jumps in to save the pitch-

                    ARTHUR
          What Mr. Cobb is trying to say-

                     COBB
          An idea.

Saito looks at Cobb, curious.
                                                3.

                    COBB
          Resilient, highly contagious. Once
          an idea's taken hold in the brain
          it's almost impossible to
          eradicate. A person can cover it
          up, ignore it- but it stays there.

                    SAITO
          But surely-to forget...?

                    COBB
          Information, yes. But an idea?
          Fully formed, understood? That
          sticks...
              (taps forehead)
          In there, somewhere.

                    SAITO
          For someone like you to steal?

                    ARTHUR
          Yes. In the dream state, conscious
          defenses are lowered and your
          thoughts become vulnerable to
          theft. It's called extraction.

                    COBB
          But, Mr. Saito, we can train your
          subconscious to defend itself from
          even the most skilled extractor.

                    SAITO
          How can you do that?

                    COBB
          Because I am the most skilled
          extractor. I know how to search
          your mind and find your secrets. I
          know the tricks, and I can teach
          them to your subconscious so that
          even when you're asleep, your guard
          is never down.

Cobb leans forwards. Holding Saito's gaze.

                    COBB
          But if I'm going to help you, you
          have to be completely open to me.
          I'll need to know my way around
          your thoughts better than your
          wife, your analyst, anyone.
              (gestures around)
          If this is a dream and you've got a
          safe full of secrets, I need to
          know what's in that safe. For this
          to work, you have to let me in.
                                                            4.

Saito gives this a flicker of a smile. Rises. A BODYGUARD
opens double doors which give onto a LAVISH PARTY.

                    SAITO
          Gentlemen. Enjoy your evening as I
          consider your proposal.

They watch Saito leave. Arthur turns to Cobb, worried-

                      ARTHUR
          He knows.

Cobb motions silence. A TREMOR starts, they steady their
glasses, Cobb glances at his watch- THE SECOND HAND IS
FROZEN.

                    ARTHUR
          What's going on up there?

And we-

                                                    CUT TO:

FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME)

Cobb, ASLEEP, SITTING IN A CHAIR AT THE END OF A STEAMING
BATH. The chair is up on a cabinet- the bottom of the legs
level with the rim of the tub.

A sweating man (40's) watches over Cobb. This is NASH. A
distant EXPLOSION rumbles through the room. Nash moves to the
window, parts the curtains. Outside: a CHAOTIC DEVELOPING-WORLD
CITY- the street filled with RIOTERS- SMASHING, BURNING.

Nash checks Cobb's left wrist: above his watch, tape holds
TWO THIN YELLOW TUBES in place. Nash looks at Cobb's watch-
THE SECOND HAND CRAWLS UNNATURALLY SLOWLY.

Nash follows the tubes to a SILVER BRIEFCASE at Arthur's
feet: ARTHUR IS ASLEEP in an armchair. Tubes connect the
briefcase to Arthur's wrist.

Nash follows another set of tubes from the briefcase to where
they pass under the door to the bedroom. Through the crack of
the door, Nash sees SAITO ASLEEP on the bed, tubes running to
his wrist. BOOM- a closer EXPLOSION, and we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME)

Nash, ASLEEP. Head ROCKING AGAINST THE WINDOW as the train
BUMPS OVER A ROUGH PIECE OF TRACK.
                                                           5.

A Japanese Man, TODASHI (18) watches Nash nervously. He
checks Nash's wrist: TWO YELLOW TUBES CONNECT NASH WITH THREE
OTHER SLEEPING MEN IN THE COMPARTMENT: COBB, ARTHUR, SAITO.

Todashi checks his watch: THE SECOND HAND TICKS IN REAL TIME.
Another TRAIN PASSES in the opposite direction with a MIGHTY
WHUMP- Todashi's eyes FLY to Nash's sleeping face-

NASH JERKS WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRAIN, and we-

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Another EXPLOSION- Nash CHECKS the sleeping Cobb and we-

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. ROOFTOP TERRACES, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT

A LOW TREMOR RUMBLES THROUGH THE CASTLE. Cobb and Arthur
steady themselves against the wooden rail. Several TILES and
pieces of MASONRY fall. Below them a BLACK SEA churns. Other
GUESTS wander the massive terraces.

                    ARTHUR
          Saito knows. He's playing with us.

                    COBB
          I can get it here. The
          information's in the safe- he
          looked right at it when I mentioned
          secrets.

Arthur nods. Then spots someone over Cobb's shoulder.

                    ARTHUR
          What's she doing here, Cobb?

Cobb turns to see a beautiful woman, elegantly dressed,
staring out at the sea. This is MAL. Cobb watches her.

                    COBB
          You just get to your room. I'll
          take care of the rest.

                    ARTHUR
          See that you do. We're here to
          work.

Arthur brushes past Mal, shaking his head. She nears Cobb.
Looks out at the DROP. The WIND WHIPS HER HAIR-

                    MAL
          If I jumped, would I survive?
                                                           6.

                    COBB
          With a clean dive, perhaps. Mal,
          why are you here?

She turns to look at him. Amused.

                    MAL
          I thought you might be missing
          me...

She smiles. He leans in, mesmerized.

                    COBB
          I am. But I can't trust you
          anymore.

She stares up at him, inviting.

                       MAL
          So what?

INT. BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER

Mal sips champagne as she studies a painting by Francis
Bacon.

                    MAL
          Looks like Arthur's taste.

Cobb is looking down through the window at the GUARDS
patrolling the castle at ground level.

                    COBB
          Actually, Mr. Saito is partial to
          postwar British painters.

He turns to Mal, donning a pair of black leather gloves.

                    COBB
          Would you sit down?

Mal lowers herself gracefully into a leather wingback chair.
Cobb approaches, pulls out a length of BLACK ROPE and kneels
at Mal's feet. She looks down at him.

                       MAL
          Tell me...

Cobb TIES the rope around the CHAIR LEGS.

                    MAL
          Do the children miss me?

Cobb pauses. He lets his gloved fingers lightly touch Mal's
ankle. He looks up at her.
                                                            7.

                    COBB
          You can't imagine.

Mal looks away, uncomfortable. Cobb gets to his feet, letting
out the rope as he moves back to the window.

                    MAL
          What're you doing?

Cobb tosses the rope out-

                    COBB
          Getting some air.

He tugs on the rope, testing. The weight of the chair, with
Mal on it, holds.

                    COBB
          Stay seated. Please.

And with that, he JUMPS. Mal considers the open window.

EXT. JAPANESE CASTLE WALL - CONTINUOUS

Cobb RAPPELS down the wall, darting past windows. He stops at
a particular one. Gets out a glass cutter-

Suddenly he starts DROPPING-

INT. BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

The EMPTY CHAIR SLIDES across the floor- WEDGES under the
window-

EXT. JAPANESE CASTLE WALL - CONTINUOUS

Cobb JOLTS to a stop 15 ft. lower. He looks up at the bedroom
window. Shakes his head. Starts climbing back.

INT. KITCHEN, JAPANESE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb drops silently from the window into the darkened
kitchen. He pulls a PISTOL from his belt, screwing a SILENCER
onto the barrel as he GLIDES across the room.

INT. HALL, JAPANESE CASTLE-CONTINUOUS

Cobb SLIPS through the shadows towards a GUARD stationed at
the head of a GRAND STAIRCASE...

The Guard HEARS something- TURNS- PEERS into the shadows...

Cobb FLASHES out of the shadows, silenced pistol up, AIMING-
                                                          8.

PHHT- head shot- the Guard starts to drop... but Cobb is
already there to CATCH him, sliding on his knees and lowering
the Guard SILENTLY to the floor.

INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

Cobb moves to a PAINTING. With practiced hands he removes it
from the wall, revealing a SAFE. Cobb spins the dial, pulls
it OPEN, GRABS an envelope from within, stuffs it into his
waistband, where there is already an IDENTICAL ENVELOPE.

LIGHTS COME ON. Cobb freezes.

                    SAITO (O.S.)
          Turn around.

Cobb turns. At the far end of the room: Saito. Next to him is
Mal, gun in hand. She smiles at Cobb.

                    MAL
          The gun, Dom.

Cobb doesn't move. Mal motions outside- two GUARDS drag
Arthur into the room. Mal puts the gun to his head.

                    MAL
          Please.

Cobb slowly places his gun at his end of the long table, then
SLIDES it along the polished ebony. It comes to rest HALFWAY
down the length or the table.

                    SAITO
          Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.

Cobb reaches into his waistband, removes ONE of the
envelopes, SLIDES it along the table. Steps back, hands
raised.

                     COBB
          Did she tell you, or have you known
          all along?

                     SAITO
          That you're here to steal from me?
              (beat)
          Or that we're actually asleep?

Arthur gives Cobb an I-told-you-so look.

                    SAITO
          I want to know who your employer
          is.

Mal COCKS the gun at Arthur's temple.
                                                           9.

                    COBB
          No point threatening him in a
          dream.

                    MAL
          That depends on what you're
          threatening. Killing him would just
          wake him up... but pain? Pain is in
          the mind...

Mal LOWERS the gun and SHOOTS Arthur in the leg- Arthur
drops, SCREAMING- Mal looks at Cobb, cold.

                    MAL
          And, judging by the decor, we're in
          your mind, aren't we, Arthur?

Cobb watches Arthur's PAIN. Mal aims at Arthur's other leg...

Cobb SPRINGS for the table, SKIDDING along its polished
surface- he GRABS his gun- SHOOTS ARTHUR BETWEEN THE EYES-

Arthur DROPS- the room starts to SHUDDER in a MASSIVE
EARTHQUAKE- Cobb SPRINGS for the door- Arthur's eyes stare at
the ceiling, DEAD, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY

Arthur's EYES OPEN as he WAKES IN THE ARMCHAIR- he GRABS at
the tubes at his wrist, YANKING them free-

                    NASH
          What're you doing?! It's too soon-

FLUID spurts from the tubes as Arthur STRUGGLES with the
SILVER CASE on the bathroom floor.

                    ARTHUR
          I know! We have to reconnect the
          loop before they wake up!

Arthur grabs the case and pushes through the door to the
bedroom- following the tubes to where they meet Saito's wrist-
SAITO LIES ON THE BED ASLEEP. Saito STIRS and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. JAPANESE CASTLE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Cobb LURCHES towards the stairs, as all around him the
building BUCKS and HEAVES-
                                                           10.

INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

Saito and the Guards PANIC. Mal walks calmly through the
destruction, picks up the envelope and turns to Saito.

                    MAL
          He was close. Very close.

EXT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

Cobb runs up the stairs, pulling out the SECOND ENVELOPE-

INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

Saito RIPS open the envelope, pulls out sheets of paper. He
looks at Mal, PANICKED. He turns to the Guards-

                      SAITO
          Stop him!

Mal, confused, looks at the sheets of paper: THEY ARE BLANK.
Mal smiles, amused.

INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS

As Cobb runs up the stairs he reads the TYPEWRITTEN SHEETS
from his envelope, and we-

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Arthur OPENS the silver case: a COMPLEX MECHANISM of TUBES,
SYRINGES, DOSAGE CONTROLLERS. Arthur's hands fly across the
machine's controls as he glances at Saito's STIRRING face-

                    ARTHUR
          I'm not going to make it! Wake
          Cobb!

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Nash turns to Cobb. Raises his hand and SMACKS him across the
face, and we-

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT

Cobb is SMASHED sideways off his feet...
                                                        11.

INT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT

The CEILING CRACKS above Saito- he looks up as a TON of STONE
floods down, CRUSHING HIM and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Saito's eyes FLICKER OPEN. AWAKE.

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Nash SMACKS Cobb again-

                    NASH
          He won't wake!

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM-CONTINUOUS

Arthur crouched by Saito, connects the second tube.

                      ARTHUR
          Dunk him!

A CLICK: Arthur looks up to find Saito with a gun to his head
and a finger to his lips, gesturing silence...

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Nash puts his hand on Cobb's forehead and PUSHES HIM
BACKWARDS- as Cobb starts to FALL BACKWARDS in the chair we
are in SLOW MOTION, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT

Cobb, full speed, picks himself up, scrambling to read the
last sheet of paper. He stares at it PUZZLED- bullets hit
around him as the Guards race up the stairs and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY

Cobb in SLOW MOTION, hits the WATER- head THRASHING as he
goes under- and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. GRAND STAIRCASE, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT

Cobb glances up from the paper as WATER EXPLODES IN THROUGH
ALL THE WINDOWS, FLOODING THE ENTIRE HALL-
                                                        12.

COBB IS SWAMPED BY WATER, SPUN IN ALL DIRECTIONS AT ONCE- HE
PULLS DEEPER OR FOR THE SURFACE, WE CAN'T TELL...

HE BREAKS THE SURFACE, GASPING FOR AIR IN THE BATHTUB IN THE-

INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY

Cobb's AWAKE, GULPING AIR, getting his bearings.

Saito SMASHES into the room, KNOCKING Nash down- Cobb
LAUNCHES himself out of the tub, FLYING dripping wet across
the room to SLAM Saito against the door- the gun DROPS,
Cobb's fist CONNECTS with Saito's jaw and the struggle is
over.

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb, wet but composed, sits, turning Saito's gun in his
hand. Nash holds Saito's arms behind him. Outside, the sounds
of RIOTING grow louder.

                    COBB
          You came prepared.

                    SAITO
          I bring the gun because not even my
          head of security knows this
          apartment. How did you find it?

Arthur, at the window, looks out at the WORSENING VIOLENCE.

                    COBB
          Hard for a man in your position to
          keep a love nest totally secret...
          particularly when there's a married
          woman involved.

                    SAITO
          She would never...

                    COBB
          And yet, here we are.

Saito is silent.

                    COBB
          With a dilemma.

                    SAITO
          You got what you came for.

                     COBB
          Not quite. The key piece of
          information wasn't there, was it,
          Mr. Saito?
                                                         13.

Arthur looks over at Cobb, worried.

                    ARTHUR
          They're getting closer, Cobb.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

Todashi slips a pair of HEADPHONES over Nash's ears, then
pulls out an MP3 player and we-

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Saito's eyes are on the floor.

                    COBB
          You held something back because you
          knew what we were up to...

Cobb uses the barrel of the gun to raise Saito's chin.

                    COBB
          So why let us in at all?

Saito smiles, defiant. VIOLENT NOISES echo up the stairway...

                    SAITO
          An audition.

                    COBB
          Audition for what?

                    SAITO
          It doesn't matter. You failed.

                    COBB
          I extracted all the information you
          had in there.

                    SAITO
          But your deception was readily
          apparent.

And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

Todashi opens the SILVER BRIEFCASE, revealing the complex
mechanism of syringes and controllers- FOUR CONTROLLERS
DISPLAY COUNTDOWNS.
                                                        14.

Todashi waits for the first countdown to hit "30," then HITS
PLAY on the MP3 player- He watches Nash's sleeping face as he
RAISES the volume...

Through Nash's headphones: the opening bars of Edith Piaf's
"Non, je ne regrette rien," and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

In the distant background, strange MASSIVE low-end MUSICAL
start, sounding like DISTANT HORNS...

                    SAITO
          So leave me and go.

                    COBB
          You know the corporation who hired
          us won't accept failure. We won't
          last two days...

The DISTANT, SLOWED-DOWN MUSIC is becoming LOUDER, as are the
SHOUTS coming up the stairs. Arthur looks at his watch, its
SLOW SECOND TICKING MARKS TIME WITH THE MASSIVE MUSIC.

                    ARTHUR
          Come on, Cobb.

                    COBB
          So now I have to do this the old-
          fashioned way-

Cobb GRABS SAITO AND PUTS HIS HEAD TO THE FLOOR, gun pressed
into his cheek. Saito looks into Cobb's eyes- sees he will
pull the trigger. Saito BLINKS, looks away in shame-

When he NOTICES SOMETHING. And starts LAUGHING.

                    SAITO
          I've always hated this carpet.

Cobb's eyes flick to the carpet and back.

                    SAITO
          It's stained and frayed in such
          distinctive ways...

Cobb looks up at Nash, who shrugs, at a loss.

                    SAITO
          But very definitely made of wool.
          Right now I'm lying on polyester.
                                                           15.

Cobb glares at Nash, and we-

Todashi watches the first of the countdowns hit ZERO- He
looks up at Arthur, STIRRING, and we-

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM-DAY

Saito turns from the carpet to look up at Cobb.

                    SAITO
          Which means I'm not lying on my
          carpet, in my apartment...
              (smiles)
          You've lived up to your reputation,
          Mr. Cobb... I'm still dreaming.

Cobb looks over to Arthur, but ARTHUR HAS VANISHED, and we-

Arthur's eyes flicker open, AWAKE. He RIPS at his tubes.

          How'd it go?

                      ARTHUR
          Not good.

Arthur checks the remaining three countdowns, and we-

Saito gets to his feet, looking admiringly at Cobb.

                     SAITO
          A dream within a dream-I'm
          impressed.

Cobb lowers the gun. Defeated. Glances at his watch. The
music REVERBERATES, the RIOTERS BANG ON THE DOOR, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

Arthur retracts the tubes into the case as he watches the
next countdown hit ZERO, and we-

INT. DILAPIDATED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Another BANG on the door- Saito, confident now, approaches
Cobb. Nash is behind Saito.

                    SAITO
          But in my dream, we really ought to
          be playing by my rules...

                    NASH
          Ah, yes, but you see, Mr. Saito-

Saito turns to Nash-

                    COBB
          We're not in your dream-

Saito turns back to Cobb, BUT COBB HAS VANISHED-

                    NASH
          We're in mine.

Saito SPINS back to Nash- the DOOR SMASHES OFF ITS HINGES AS
RIOTERS POUR INTO THE ROOM, SWARMING OVER NASH... BUT NASH IS
GONE. The music DIES. Saito and the rioters stand there in
the SILENCE, the light DWINDLING... and we-

          Asshole!

Nash BLINKS. Arthur is in his face, furious.

                    ARTHUR
          How could you get the carpet
          wrong?!

                    NASH
          It wasn't my fault!

                    ARTHUR
          You're the architect-
                                                        17.

                    NASH
          I didn't know he was going to rub
          his damn cheek on it!

Cobb pulls Arthur away from Nash.

                     COBB
          Lets go.

                    ARTHUR
          And you-what the hell was all that?

                    COBB
          I had it under control.

                    ARTHUR
          I'd hate to see out of control-

                    COBB
          There's no time for this-I'm
          getting off at Kyoto.

                    ARTHUR
          Why? He's not gonna search every
          compartment.

                    COBB
          I can't stand trains.

Arthur moves to the briefcase. Turns a dial.

                    ARTHUR
          I can keep him under for one minute-

Arthur hits a button- A PLUNGER DEPRESSES. Cobb RIPS the tape
off Saito's wrist, ROLLS up his tubes. Arthur SLAMS the
silver case shut. Todashi pulls open the door-

                    COBB
          Every man for himself.

Arthur and Nash EXIT, heading in different directions down
the corridor. Cobb hands Todashi a thick roll of CASH, looks
at Saito, who stirs. Cobb moves off.

EXT. JAPANESE COUNTRYSIDE - CONTINUOUS

The BULLET TRAIN speeds through the lush landscape.

INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Saito WAKES GENTLY. Looks around the compartment, empty but
for Todashi, reading a comic. Saito looks down at his wrist.
Sees a small mark. Rubs it. SMILES.
                                                        18.

EXT. TOKYO - DUSK

Moving over the vast city towards a high rise. A HELICOPTER
thumps into frame, heading for a pad on the roof.

INT. APARTMENT, TOKYO - CONTINUOUS

Cobb sits, waiting. Checks his watch, restless. He pulls a
HANDGUN. Checks it is loaded. places it on the table in front
of him. Pulls out a PEWTER SPINNING TOP, SPINS it on the
table ... He INTENT STUDIES the top's spin... As he stares,
the sound of a FREIGHT TRAIN builds and builds- the top
WOBBLES, TIPS onto its side- the sound of the train STOPS.
the PHONE RINGS- Cobb GRABS it-

                    CHILDREN'S VOICES (over phone)
          Hi, Daddy! Hi, Dad.

                    COBB
          Hey, guys. How are you?

                    CHILDREN'S VOICES (over phone)
          Good. Okay, I guess.

Cobb closes his eyes, trying to picture his children: INSERT
CUT: COBB's MEMORY- a LITTLE BLONDE BOY (3), back towards us,
crouches IN A GARDEN, looks at something in the grass...

                    COBB
          Who's just okay? Was that James?

                    JAMES (over phone)
          Yeah. When are you coming home?

                    COBB
          I can't. Not for a while.

INSERT CUT: A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL (5), also FACE UNSEEN, joins
JAMES, CROUCHING BESIDE HIM...

                    JAMES (over phone)
          Why?

                    COBB
          Well, James, like I've told you-I'm
          away because I'm working...

                    LITTLE GIRL (over phone)
          Grandma says you're never coming
          back.
Cobb pauses. Takes a breath. INSERT CUT: James and Philippa,
FACES UNSEEN, lift their heads from the grass, responding to
someone's call- they RUN AWAY FROM US ACROSS THE GARDEN...
                                                          19.

                    COBB
          Philippa, can you ask Grandma to
          pick up the phone-

                    PHILIPPA (over phone)
          She's shaking her head.

Cobb TENSES, as if about to SMASH the phone.

                    COBB
          Well, we'll just have to hope
          Grandma's wrong about that won't
          we?

                    JAMES
              (over phone)
          Daddy?

                    COBB
          Yes?

                    JAMES (over phone)
          Is Mommy with you?

Cobb looks like he just got punched- INSERT CUT: COBB'S
MEMORY- MAL, WIND BLOWING HER HAIR, SMILES CALMLY...

                    COBB
          No. No, we talked about this,
          James. Mommy's gone.

                    JAMES (over phone)
          Where?

                    GRANDMA'S VOICE (over phone)
          Time to go, kids. Say bye-bye-
                    COBB
          I'll give some presents to Grandpa,
          okay? Just be good for-

Cobb STARES at the dead phone. Then DOWNS his drink- A KNOCK
at the door. Cobb GRABS the top, the gun- MOVES to the door-
cracks it: Arthur.

                    ARTHUR
          Our ride's on the roof.

Cobb nods. Moves to pick up his bag. Arthur watches.

                    ARTHUR
          Cobb... are you okay?

Cobb looks up.
                                                           20.

                       COBB
          Yeah, why?

                    ARTHUR
          Down in the dream... Mal showing up
          like that ...

                    COBB
          Yeah. I'm sorry about your leg.

                    ARTHUR
          It's getting worse, isn't it?

                    COBB
          One apology's all you're getting,
          Arthur. Now, where's Nash?

                    ARTHUR
          Hasn't shown. Wanna wait?

                    COBB
              (shakes head)
          We were supposed to deliver Saito's
          expansion plans to Cobol Engineering
          two hours ago. By now they know we
          failed. Time to disappear.

INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Cobb and Arthur head towards the elevator.

                    ARTHUR
          Where will you go?

                    COBB
          Buenos Aires. I can lie low there.
          Maybe sniff out a job when things
          quiet down. You?

                       ARTHUR
          Stateside.

                    COBB
              (wistful) )
          'Course. Send my regards.

Arthur looks at Cobb. Nods. Sympathetic.

EXT. ROOFTOP HELIPAD - NIGHT

The HELICOPTER sits, ROTORS SPINNING. As Cobb and Arthur
reach the door, it SLIDES OPEN. Cobb steps up into the
leather-padded interior. He freezes.
                                                        21.

INT. HELICOPTER ON PAD - CONTINUOUS

Nash, BEATEN BLOODY, sits on the far side, slumped against
the wine. Beside him: SAITO. He nods politely at Cobb.

                    SAITO
          He sold you out. Thought to come to
          me and bargain for his life...

Saito's BODYGUARD offers Cobb a GUN.

                    SAITO
          So I offer you the satisfaction.

                    COBB
          That's not how I deal with things.

                    SAITO
          Would you work with him again?

Cobb shakes his head. Saito's BODYGUARDS PULL Nash from the
chopper. Saito motions Cobb and Arthur to sit. The chopper
RISES. Cobb watches Nash DRAGGED across the pad.

                    COBB
          What will you do to him?

                    SAITO
          Nothing. But I can't speak for your
          friends from Cobol Engineering.

Saito looks out at the city slipping by.

                    COBB
          What do you want from us?

                       SAITO
          Inception.

Arthur raises his eyebrows. Cobb is poker-faced.

                    SAITO
          Is it possible?

                    ARTHUR
          Of course not.

                    SAITO
          If you can steal an idea from
          someone's mind, why can't you plant
          one there instead?

                    ARTHUR
          Okay, here's planting an idea: I
          say to you, "Don't think about
          elephants."
                    (MORE)
                                                        22.
                    ARTHUR (CONT'D)
              (Saito nods)
          What are you thinking about?

                       SAITO
          Elephants.

                    ARTHUR
          Right. But it's not your idea
          because you know I gave it to you.

                    SAITO
          You could plant it subconsciously-

                    ARTHUR
          The subject's mind can always trace
          the genesis of the idea. True
          inspiration is impossible to fake.

                    COBB
          No, it isn't.

                    SAITO
          Can you do it?

                    COBB
          I won't do it.

                    SAITO
          In exchange, I'll give you the
          information you were paid to steal.

                    COBB
          Are you giving me a choice? Because
          I can find my own way to square
          things with Cobol.

                    SAITO
          Then you do have a choice.

                    COBB
          And I choose to leave.

EXT. AIRFIELD - MOMENTS LATER

The helicopter sets down next to a PRIVATE JET.

INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

Saito indicates the plane.

                    SAITO
          Tell the crew where you want to go,
          they'll file the plan en route.

Cobb and Arthur look at each other. Then move for the door.
                                                23.

                    SAITO
          Mr. Cobb...? There is one other
          thing I could offer you.
              (Cobb stops)
          How would you like to go home? To
          America. To your children.

Cobb turns back to Saito.

                    COBB
          You can't fix that. Nobody could.

                    SAITO
          Just like inception.

Cobb considers this. Arthur touches his arm.

                    ARTHUR
          Cobb, come on-

                    COBB
          How complex is the idea?

                    SAITO
          Simple enough.

                    COBB
          No idea's simple when you have to
          plant it in someone else's mind.

                    SAITO
          My main competitor is an old man in
          poor health. His son will soon
          inherit control of the corporation.
          I need him to decide to break up
          his father's empire. Against his
          own self-interest.

                    ARTHUR
          Cobb, we should walk away from
          this.

                    COBB
          If I were to do it. If I could do
          it... how do I know you can
          deliver?

                    SAITO
          You don't. But I can. So do you
          want to take a leap of faith, or
          become an old man, filled with
          regret, waiting to die alone?

Cobb looks at Saito. Barely nods.
                                                          24.

                    SAITO
          Assemble your team, Mr. Cobb. And
          choose your people more wisely.

INT. PRIVATE JET - LATER

Cobb reclines his seat. Arthur picks at a salad, angry.

                    ARTHUR
          I know how much you want to go home-

                    COBB
              (sharp)
          No, you don't.

                    ARTHUR
          But this can't be done.

                    COBB
          It can. You just have to go deep
          enough.

                    ARTHUR
          You don't know that!-

                    COBB
          I've done it before.

Arthur is taken aback. Cobb turns to the window.

                    ARTHUR
          Did it work?

                       COBB
                 (quiet)
          Yes.

                    ARTHUR
          Who did you do it to?

Cobb looks at Arthur. Closed. Arthur shrugs.

                    ARTHUR
          So why are we headed to Paris?

                     COBB
          We're going to need a new
          architect.

INT. GREAT HALL, �COLE D'ARCHITECTURE - MORNING

Cobb, carrying a shopping bag, looks into a lecture hall: no
students, just a RUMPLED PROFESSOR hunched over paperwork.
                                                        25.

INT. LECTURE HALL - CONTINUOUS

                    COBB (O.S.)
          You never did like your office.

PROFESSOR MILES looks up, squinting. Recognizes Cobb.

                    MILES
          No space to think in that broom
          cupboard.

Cobb steps down past the empty wooden rows.

                    MILES
          Is it safe for you to be here?

                    COBB
          Extradition between France and the
          U.S. is a bureaucratic nightmare.

                    MILES
          I think they'd find a way to make
          it work in your case.

Cobb hand Miles the shopping bag.

                    COBB
          Can you take these back for the
          kids?

                    MILES
          It'll take more than the occasional
          stuffed animal to convince those
          children they still have a father.

                    COBB
          I know. I thought you could talk to
          Marie about bringing them on
          vacation. Somewhere I could meet-

                    MILES
          Why would she listen to me?

                    COBB
          You were married for twenty years.

                    MILES
          She blames me as much as you.

                    COBB
          Doesn't she understand that my kids
          need me?
                                                26.

                    MILES
          Yes, she does. We all do. Go back
          and face the music, Dom. Explain
          what Mal did.

                    COBB
          Be realistic, Stephen. They'd never
          understand- they'd lock me up and
          throwaway the key. Or worse.

                    MILES
          You think what you're doing now is
          helping your case?

                    COBB
          Lawyers don't pay for themselves.
          This is what I have. This is what
          you taught me.

                    MILES
          I never taught you to be a thief.

                    COBB
          No, you taught me to navigate other
          people's minds. But after what
          happened with Mal there weren't a
          whole lot of legitimate ways for me
          to use that skill.

Miles looks at Cobb.

                    MILES
          Why did you come here, Dom?

Cobb shifts slightly.

                     COBB
          I found a way home. A job. For
          powerful people. If I pull it off,
          I can get back to my family. But I
          need help.

Miles realizes something.

                    MILES
          My God. You're here to corrupt one
          of my brightest and best.

                    COBB
          If you have someone good enough,
          you have to let them decide for
          themselves. You know what I'm
          offering-

                       MILES
          Money?
                                                27.

                    COBB
          No, not just money: the chance to
          build cathedrals, entire cities-
          things that have never existed,
          things that couldn't exist in the
          real world...

                    MILES
          Everybody dreams, Cobb. Architects
          are supposed to make those dreams
          real.

                    COBB
          That's not what you used to say.
          You told me that in the real world
          I'd be building attic conversions
          and gas stations. You said that if
          I mastered the dream-share I'd have
          a whole new way of creating and
          showing people my creations. You
          told me it would free me.

Miles looks at Cobb, sad.

                    MILES
          And I'm sorry. I was wrong.

                    COBB
          No, you weren't. Your vision was a
          vision of pure creativity. It's
          where we took it that was wrong.

                    MILES
          And now you want me to let someone
          else follow you into fantasy.

                    COBB
          They won't actually come on the
          job, they'll just design the levels
          and teach them to the dreamers.

                    MILES
          Design them yourself.

                    COBB
          Mal won't let me.

Miles looks at Cobb. Appalled.

                    MILES
          Come back to reality, Dom. Please.

                    COBB
          You want to know what's real,
          Stephen? Your grandchildren waiting
          for their dad to come back.
                    (MORE)
                                                        28.
                    COBB (CONT'D)
          This job-this last job-is how I get
          there.

Miles looks down, fiddles with his papers.

                    COBB
          I wouldn't be standing here if
          there were any other way. I can get
          home. But I need an architect who's
          as good as I was.

Miles looks Cobb in the eye. Decides.

                    MILES
          I've got someone better.

INT. CORRIDOR - LATER

Miles and Cobb stand by as STUDENTS file out of a lecture.

                       MILES
          Ariadne...

A young woman carrying books turns. This is ARIADNE.

                    MILES
          I'd like you to meet Mr. Cobb.

She sizes him up with quick eyes. Offers her hand.

                    ARIADNE
          Pleased to meet you.

                    MILES
          If you have a few moments, Mr. Cobb
          has a job offer to discuss with
          you.

                    ARIADNE
          A work placement?

                    COBB
              (smiles
          Not exactly.

EXT. ROOFTOP, �COLE D'ARCHITECTURE - MOMENTS LATER

Ariadne leans against the parapet, overlooking Paris. She
unwraps a sandwich, watching Cobb pull out a pad of GRAPH
PAPER and a PEN. He offers them. She bites her sandwich.

                       COBB
          A test.
                                                           29.

                    ARIADNE
              (mouth full)
          Aren't you going to tell me
          anything?

                    COBB
          Before I describe the job, I have
          to know you could do it.

                    ARIADNE
          Why?

                    COBB
          It's not, strictly speaking, legal.

Ariadne raises her eyebrows.

                    COBB
          You have two minutes to draw a maze
          that takes me one minute to solve.

Ariadne takes the pad and pen. Cobb looks at his watch.

                    COBB
          Go.

She starts DRAWING LINES on the grid, constructing a maze.

                    COBB
          Stop.

Ariadne hands the pad and pen to Cobb. He glances at the pad,
then, looking her in the eye, TRACES the solution. She is
taken aback. Cobb RIPS off the sheet, hands the pad back.

                    COBB
          Again.

She traces straight lines, CONCENTRATING...

                    COBB
          Stop.

She hands Cobb the pad, a touch pleased. Cobb solves the
puzzle instantly, as before. Her smile falls.

                    COBB
          You'll have to-

She GRABS the pad, frustrated... but this time she FLIPS it
over and starts drawing on the BLANK CARDBOARD of the back.
Cobb watches, surprised. He smiles as he sees that she's
drawing CIRCLES, creating a maze based on concentric rings.

Ariadne hands back the pad, defiant. Cobb takes the pen,
starts the maze. This time he gets stuck. Nods.
                                                           30.

                    COBB
              (working the maze)
          More like it.

EXT. NARROW STREET, PARIS - DAY

Arthur stops at a warehouse door. Consults a piece of paper.

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

A large, dusty warehouse. The SLIDING DOOR cracks open.
Arthur enters. Looks around, approvingly.

INT. SAME - LATER

Arthur DRAGS LAWN CHAIRS into the middle of the room. He
erects a table. Lays out several SILVER CASES, unpacking
them, laying out lines of tubing, MECHANISMS...

EXT. PARISIAN CAFE - DAY

Cobb and Ariadne sit at an outdoor table.

                    COBB
          They say we only use a fraction of
          the true potential of our brains...
          but they're talking about when
          we're awake. While we dream, the
          mind performs wonders.

                     ARIADNE
          Such as?

                    COBB
          How do you imagine a building? You
          consciously create each aspect,
          puzzling over it in stages... But
          sometimes, when your imagination
          flies-

                    ARIADNE
          I'm discovering it.

                    COBB
          Exactly. Genuine inspiration.

Cobb leans forwards and draws on the paper table cloth.

                    COBB
          In a dream your mind continuously
          does that...

Cobb has drawn a circle made of two arrows.
                                                     31.

                    COBB
          It creates and perceives a world
          simultaneously. So well that you
          don't feel your brain doing the
          creating. That's why we can short-
          circuit the process...

                    ARIADNE
          How?

                    COBB
          By taking over the creating part.

Cobb draws a straight line between the two arrows.

                    COBB
          This is where you come in. You
          build the world of the dream. We
          take the subject into that dream,
          and let him �111 it with his
          subconscious

                    ARIADNE
          But are you trying to fool him that
          the dream is actually real life?

                     COBB
              (nods)
          While we're in there, We don't want
          him to realize he's dreaming.

                    ARIADNE
          How could I ever get enough detail
          to Convince him that it's real?

                    COBB
          Our dreams reel real while we're in
          them. It's only when we wake up we
          realize things were strange,

Ariadne gestures around them-

                    ARIADNE
          But all the textures of real life-
          the stone, the fabric. cars...
          people... your mind can't create
          all this.

                    COBB
          It does. Every time you dream. Let
          me ask you a question: You never
          remember the beginning of your
          dreams, do you? You just turn up in
          the middle of what's going on.
                                                        32.

                       ARIADNE
          I guess.

                    COBB
          So... how did we end up at this
          restaurant?

                    ARIADNE
          We came here from...

Ariadne trails off, confused.

                    COBB
          How did we get here? Where are we?

Ariadne THINKS, unable to remember. A FAINT RUMBLE begins.

                    ARIADNE
          Oh my God. We're dreaming.

Cobb nods. The RUMBLE is BUILDING.

                    COBB
          Stay calm. We're actually asleep in
          the workshop. This is your first
          lesson in shared dreaming,
          remember?

Ariadne looks around, mind REELING. Cobb BRACES-

The restaurant VIOLENTLY FRAGMENTS, EXPLODING AND IMPLODING
PARTICLES OF FURNITURE, WALLS, PEOPLE FLYING AROUND- Ariadne
WONDERS at the MAYHEM WHIRLING around them- Cobb SHIELDS his
head against the debris. She sees him-

                    ARIADNE
              (shouting over noise)
          If it's just a dream, why are you
          covering your-

Ariadne is WIPED FROM HER SEAT BY A MASSIVE BLAST and we-

                                                   CUT TO:

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Ariadne JOLTS awake.

                    COBB (O.S.)
          Because it's never just a dream.

Ariadne turns to Cobb's voice. They are both sitting in the
lawn chairs. Arthur watches over them.
                                                        33.

                    COBB
          And a face full of glass hurts like
          hell, doesn't it? While we're in
          it, it's real.

                    ARTHUR
          That's why the military developed
          dream sharing-a training program
          where soldiers could strangle, stab
          and shoot each other, then wake up.

                    ARIADNE
          How did architects get involved?

                    COBB
          Someone had to design the dreams.
              (to Arthur)
          Let's go another five minutes-

                    ARIADNE
          We were only asleep for five
          minutes? We talked for an hour at
          least...

                    COBB
          When you dream, your mind functions
          more quickly, so time seems to pass
          more slowly.

                    ARTHUR
          Five minutes in the real world
          gives you an hour in the dream.

                    COBB
          Let's see how much trouble you can
          cause in five minutes.

And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. SAME PARISIAN STREET - DAY

Ariadne walks down the crowded street with Cobb. Cobb looks
around at the street, the cafe, approving.

                    COBB
          It's good. You've got the cafe, the
          layout... you forgot the book shop
          but pretty much everything else is
          here.

Ariadne looks at the passers-by.

                    ARIADNE
          Who are the people?
                                                        34.

                    COBB
          They're projections of my
          subconscious.

                     ARIADNE
          Yours?

                    COBB
          Sure-you are the dreamer, I am the
          subject. My subconscious populates
          your world. That's one way we get
          at a subject's thoughts-his mind
          creates the people, so we can
          literally talk to his subconscious.

                    ARIADNE
          How else do you do it?

                    COBB
          Architecture. Build a bank vault or
          a jail, something secure, and the
          subject's mind will fill it with
          information he's trying to protect.

                    ARIADNE
          Then you break in and steal it.

                     COBB
          Exactly.

Ariadne wonders at the detail of the street.

                     ARIADNE
          I love the concrete sense of things-
              (stamps foot)
          Real weight, you know? I thought a
          dream space would be all about the
          visual, but it's the feel of
          things. Question is, what happens
          as you start to mess with
          physics...

She CONCENTRATES on the street. The street starts to BEND IN
HALF- the buildings on either side FOLDING IN until they form
the INSIDE OF A CUBE OF CITY, GRAVITY FUNCTIONING
INDEPENDENTLY ON EACH PLANE. Ariadne looks up (or down) at
the people on the opposite city surface. Cobb watches her
excitement.

                    ARIADNE
          It's something, isn't it?

                    COBB
              (quiet)
          Yes. It is.
                                                        35.

As they walk, Ariadne notices more and more of the
projections STARING at her.

                    ARIADNE
          Why are they looking at me?

                    COBB
          Because you're changing things. My
          subconscious feels that someone
          else is creating the world. The
          more you change things, the quicker
          the projections converge on you.

                      ARIADNE
          Converge?

                    COBB
          They feel the foreign nature of the
          dreamer, and attack-like white
          blood cells fighting an infection.

                    ARIADNE
          They're going to attack us?

                    COBB
          Just you, actually.

They walk along the street to where it joins the next
gravitational plane. They step up onto the different plane
and walk down the street towards a river. As Ariadne
approaches, steps emerge from the flagstone, and she leads
Cobb up onto a small jetty. As she concentrates, pillars
emerge and a BRIDGE starts to telescope out from the jetty.
They step onto it as it grows. Cobb is impressed.

                    COBB
          It's beautiful... but if you keep
          on changing things...

People crossing the bridge STARE at Ariadne. Several of them
BUMP her shoulder as they pass.

                    ARIADNE
          Mind telling your subconscious to
          take it easy?

                    COBB
          That's why it's called subconscious.
          I don't control it.

The bridge now spans the Seine. Cobb marvels at it.

                    COBB
          Arched stone, iron pillars...
          it's...
                                                          36.

Cobb pauses, thinking. Remembering.

INSERT CUT: Mal, hair blowing, turns to Cobb, smiling,
laughing. He smiles back. They are on the same bridge.

                    COBB
          I know this bridge. This place is
          real-
              (serious)
          You didn't imagine it, you
          remembered it...

                     ARIADNE
              (nods)
          I cross it every day on my way to
          the college.

                    COBB
          Never recreate places from your
          memory. Always imagine new places.

                    ARIADNE
          You have to draw from what you know-

                    COBB
              (tense)
          Use pieces-a streetlamp,
          phonebooths, a type of brick-not
          whole areas.

Several people around them ECHO Cobb's attitude...

                     ARIADNE
          Why not?

                    COBB
          Because building dreams out of your
          own memories is the surest way to
          lose your grip on what's real and
          what's a dream.

                    ARIADNE
          Did that happen to you?

Cobb says nothing. He stands there, starinq at Ariadne.
PEOPLE around her stop and look at her, hostile.

                    COBB
          Look, this isn't about me-

Cobb reaches for Ariadne's arm, turns her to him-

                    ARIADNE
          Is that why you need me to build
          your dreams?
                                                         37.

A passerby GRABS Ariadne's shoulder-

                    COBB
          Leave her alone-

More of the crowd join in, PULLING at Ariadne, holding her
arms open- Cobb PULLS people off- the crowd PUSHES him away-
Cobb sees someone WALKING PURPOSEFULLY through the crowd
towards the helpless, Ariadne- it is Mal. She approaches with
even strides- Ariadne stares at her, uneasy.

                    ARIADNE
          Wake me up, Cobb.

As Mal walks, she pulls out a LARGE KNIFE-

                       COBB
          Mal, no!

                    ARIADNE
          Wake me up!

Ariadne SCREAMS as Mal LUNGES at her with the knife and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. WORKSHOP-DAY

Ariadne WAKES, BREATHING HARD. Arthur moves to her-

                       ARTHUR
          It's okay.

                    ARIADNE
          Why couldn't I wake?

                    ARTHUR
          The only way to wake from inside
          the dream is to die.

Cobb, in the lawn chair opposite, PULLS his tubes out.

                    COBB
          She'll need a totem.

                       ARIADNE
          What?

                    ARTHUR
          Some kind of personal icon. A small
          object that you can always have
          with you, and that no one else
          knows,

Cobb gets to his feet, Ariadne stares at him, furious. He
heads to the bathroom.
                                                          38.

                     ARIADNE
          That's some subconscious you've
          got, Cobb.
              (calls after him)
          She's a real charmer!

                    ARTHUR
          Sounds like you've met Mrs. Cobb.

                    ARIADNE
              (surprised)
          She's his wife?

Arthur nods, pulling off Ariadne's tubes.

                    ARTHUR
          So. A totem. You need something
          small, potentially heavy...

INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Cobb takes out his PEWTER SPINNING TOP, SPINS it on the
marble counter...

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne looks at Arthur, puzzled.

                    ARIADNE
          Like a coin?

                    ARTHUR
          Too common. You need something that
          has a weight or movement that only
          you know.

INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Cobb STUDIES the spin of the top as it decays, becoming more
and more ECCENTRIC...

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

                    ARIADNE
          What's yours?

Arthur holds out a DIE.

                    ARTHUR
          A loaded die.

Ariadne reaches for it- Arthur snatches sit away-
                                                          39.

                    ARTHUR
          I can't let you handle it. That's
          the point. No one else can know the
          weight or balance of it.

                     ARIADNE
          Why?

                    ARTHUR
          So when you examine your totem...

INT. BATHROOM, WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Cobb's spinning top WOBBLES OVER.

                    ARTHUR (O.S.)
          You know, beyond a doubt, that
          you're not in someone else's dream.

Cobb GRABS it like a drowning man reaching for a lifeline.

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne thinks this over.

                    ARIADNE
          That's not an issue for me.

                     ARTHUR
          Why not?

                    ARIADNE
          Arthur, maybe you can't see what's
          going on, maybe you don't want to.
          But Cobb's got problems he's tried
          to bury down there. I'm not going
          to open my mind to someone like
          that.

Ariadne gets to her feet. Walks away.

                    COBB (O.S.)
          She'll be back.

Arthur turns. Cobb is standing in the bathroom doorway.

                    COBB
          I've never seen anyone pick it up
          so fast. And one reality won't be
          enough for her now. When she comes
          back, get her building mazes.

                    ARTHUR
          Where will you be?
                                                           40.

                    COBB
          I've got to talk to Eames.

                    ARTHUR
          Eames? But he's in Mombasa. Cobol's
          backyard.

                    COBB
          Necessary risk.

                    ARTHUR
          There are plenty of other thieves.

                    COBB
          We don't just need a thief. We need
          a forger.

INT. GAMBLING DEN, MOMBASA - DAY

Crowded, bustling, smoke-filled. a westerner (40's), shabby
suit, is squeezed in at a dice game. This is EAMES. He
FIDDLES with his last two chips.

                    COBB (O.S.)
          Rub them against each other all you
          like, they're not going to breed.

Eames looks up to see Cobb.

                    EAMES
          You never know.

Eames tosses down his last chips. The dice are rolled...

                      COBB
          Drink?

Eames loses.

                    EAMES
          You're buying.

Cobb follows Eames. Eames mysteriously produces two stacks of
chips and puts them down in front of the cashier. Cobb pulls
one off the top, squints at the embossed name.

                    COBB
          You're spelling hasn't improved.

Eames GRABS the chip. Hands it to the cashier.

                      EAMES
          Piss off.

                    COBB
          How's your handwriting?
                                                        41.

Eames takes his money. Smiles at Cobb.

                       EAMES
          Versatile.

INT. STREET, MOMBASA - CONTINUOUS

Eames leads Cobb down the quiet street.

                    EAMES
          Word is, you're not welcome in
          these parts.

                       COBB
          Yeah?

                    EAMES
          There's a price on your head from
          Cobol Engineering. Pretty big one,
          actually.

                    COBB
          You wouldn't sell me out.

Eames looks at Cobb, offended.

                    EAMES
          `Course I would.

                    COBB
              (smiles)
          Not when you hear what I'm selling.

EXT. BALCONY OF A COFFEE HOUSE - LATER

A ramshackle balcony overlooking a bust street. Eames pours.

                       COBB
          Inception.

Eames's glass stops halfway to his mouth.

                    COBB
          Don't bother telling me it's
          impossible.

                    EAMES
          It's perfectly possible. Just
          bloody difficult.

                    COBB
          That's what I keep saying to
          Arthur.
                                      42.

          EAMES
Arthur? You're still working with
that stick-in-the-mud?

          COBB
He's a good point man.

          EAMES
The best. But he has no
imagination. If you're going to
perform inception, you need
imagination.

          COBB
You've done it before?

          EAMES
Yeas and no. We tried it. Got the
idea in place, but it didn't take.

          COBB
You didn't plant it deep enough?

          EAMES
It's not just about depth. You need
the simplest version of the idea-
the one that will grow naturally in
the subject's mind. Subtle art.

          COBB
That's why I'm here.

          EAMES
What's the idea you need to plant?

          COBB
We want the heir to a major
corporation to break up his
father's empire.

          EAMES
See, right there you've got various
political motivations, anti-
monopolistic sentiment and so
forth. But all that stuff's at the
mercy of the subject's prejudice-
you have to go to the basic.

            COBB
Which is?

          EAMES
The relationship with the father.
    (downs drink)
Do you have a chemist?
                                                        43.

Cobb shakes his head.

                     EAMES
          There's a man here. Yusuf. He
          formulates his own versions of the
          compounds.

                    COBB
          Let's go see him.

                    EAMES
          Once you've lost your tail.
              (Cobb reacts)
          Back by the bar, blue tie. Came in
          about two minutes after we did.

                    COBB
          Cobol Engineering?

                    EAMES
          They pretty much own Mombasa.

Cobb glances over the balcony.

                    COBB
          Run interference. We'll meet
          downstairs in half an hour.

                       EAMES
          Back here?

                    COBB
          Last place they'd expect.

Eames downs his drink. Rises. Walks over to the Businessman.

                       EAMES
          Freddy!

The Businessman looks up, awkward.

                    EAMES
          Freddy Simmonds, it is you!

Cobb nonchalantly SLIPS over the balcony DROPPING HARD into
the midst of the crowd on the street below.

                    EAMES
              (looks harder)
          Oh. No, it isn't.

EXT. STREET, MOMBASA - CONTINUOUS

Cobb stands up, PUSHES into the crowd- faces PEER at him- he
moves, trying to blend- TURNS- a SECOND BUSINESS MAN is
there.
                                                           44.

                       COBB
                 (disarming smile)
          Yes?

                    SECOND BUSINESSMAN
          We need to-

Cobb HEAD BUTTS the Second Businessman, PUSHES past him-

The First Businessman races out of the bar, sees Cobb's wake,
DIVES after him- Cobb RACES headlong through tight
passageways, WEAVING through or KNOCKING into the locals...

He steps into a dark, crowded cafe, scanning the tables...
the First Businessman enters, spots him. An AFRICAN MAN gets
in Cobb's face, jabbering at him in Swahili- Cobb considers
his options... the First Businessman DRAWS A GUN- Cobb bolts,
steps up on a table and out an open window, SCRAMBLING into
the alley outside...

Cobb LOOKS left, right... CUTS LEFT into a narrow, CROWDED
alley- the alley NARROWS TO A DEAD END. Faces in the CROWD
start to watch Cobb- PEOPLE start to SURROUND him- Cobb looks
back the way he came- the two Businessmen are there, GUNS
DRAWN-

Cobb sees a SMALL GAP between the buildings at the narrow end-
he THROWS himself into it- gets STUCK HALFWAY...

The crowd bears down, GRABBING for him as Cobb struggles to
SQUEEZE HIMSELF through the gap... Cobb's moving INCHES as
his pursuers gain YARDS... the Crowd is upon him... he BURSTS
FREE. TUMBLING onto the next street, ROLLING out of sight.

Cobb Jumps to his feet- in a market square. TWO MORE
BUSINESSMEN move towards him. Cobb BOLTS but a CAR SKIDS UP,
BLOCKS HIS PATH- the door opens- SAITO IS IN THE BACK.

                    SAITO
          Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?

                    COBB
              (jumping in)
          What brings you to Mombasa, Mr.
          Saito?

                    SAITO
          I have to protect my investment.

EXT. COFFEE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Eames stands on the pavement. The car pulls up. Cobb beckons
from the rear window. Eames looks at Saito. Back to Cobb.

                    EAMES
          This is your idea of losing a tail?
                                                        45.

                    COBB
              (shrugs)
          Different tail.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Arthur sits at the table, working on a mechanism. A small
COUGH prompts him to look up: Ariadne is there.

                    ARTHUR
          He said you'd be back.

                    ARIADNE
          I tried not to come.

                    ARTHUR
          But there's nothing else quite like
          it.

                    ARIADNE
          No paper, no pens... nothing
          between you and raw, direct
          creation.

Arthur picks up his mechanism.

                    ARTHUR
          Shall we take a look at paradoxical
          architecture?

Ariadne nods, takes off her coat and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. PENROSE STEPS - LATER

Arthur leads Ariadne down some busy steps in a large glass
and steel ATRIUM in an office complex.

                    ARTHUR
          You're going to have to master a
          few tricks if you're going to build
          three complete dream levels.

A SECRETARY DROPS some papers as they pass...

                    ARIADNE
          What sort of tricks?

They take a tight turn and continue down the next flight.

                    ARTHUR
          In a dream, you can cheat
          architecture into impossible
          shapes.
                    (MORE)
                                                        46.
                    ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          That lets you create closed loops,
          like the Penrose Steps. The
          infinite staircase.

Ariadne FREEZES- THEY ARE IN THE EXACT SPOT THEY STARTED
DESCENDING FROM, next to the Secretary gathering her papers.

Ariadne puzzles at the impossible construction of the stairs.

                    ARTHUR
          See...

Arthur stops her gently- they are on the highest step, with a
LARGE DROP to the next step. Arthur gestures at the drop.

                    ARTHUR
          Paradox. A closed loop like this
          helps you disguise the boundaries
          of the dream you've created.

                    ARIADNE
          How big do the levels have to be?

                    ARTHUR
          Anything from the floor of a
          building, to an entire city. But it
          has to be complicated enough for us
          to hide from the projections.

                    ARIADNE
          A maze.

                    ARTHUR
          And the better the maze-

                    ARIADNE
          The longer we have before the
          projections catch us.

Ariadne looks around. Sees people LOOKING at Arthur.

                    ARIADNE
          My subconscious seems polite
          enough.

                    ARTHUR
          You wait, they'll turn ugly. No one
          likes to see someone else messing
          around in their mind.

                    ARIADNE
          Cobb can't build anymore, can he?
                                                        47.

                    ARTHUR
          I don't know if he can't, but he
          won't. He thinks it's safer if he
          doesn't know the layouts.

                    ARIADNE
          Why?

                    ARTHUR
          He won't tell me. I think it's Mal.
          I think she's getting stronger.

                    ARIADNE
          His ex-wife?

                    ARTHUR
          She's not his ex.

                    ARIADNE
          They're still together?

Arthur turns to Ariadne. Gentle.

                    ARTHUR
          No. No, she's dead, Ariadne. What
          you see in there is just his
          projection of her.

                    ARIADNE
          What was she like in real life?

                    ARTHUR
              (quiet)
          She was lovely.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. ROOFTOP, OLD TOWN, MOMBASA - DAY

Saito deposits a FILE in front of Cobb: PHOTOS, DOCUMENTS. As
Cobb runs through them, he passes them to Eames.

                    SAITO
          Robert Fischer, 32. Heir to the
          Fischer Morrow energy conglomerate.
          He's spent his whole life being
          groomed as successor-breaking up
          his father's empire will take a
          radical shift in his thinking.

                    COBB
          What's your problem with Fischer?

                    SAITO
          That's not your concern.
                                                          48.

                    COBB
          This isn't the usual corporate
          espionage, Mr. Saito. This is
          inception. The seed of the idea we
          plant will grow in this man's mind.
          It'll change him. It might even
          come to define him.

Saito looks at Cobb.

                    SAITO
          My sources suggest you might not
          have always been so cautious.

                    COBB
          Then you need new sources, Mr.
          Saito.

Saito considers Cobb. Shrugs.

                    SAITO
          Fischer Morrow has the regulators
          in their pockets. We're the last
          company standing between them and
          total energy dominance and we can
          no longer compete. Soon they'll
          control the energy supply of half
          the world. They'll be able to
          blackmail governments, dictate
          policy. In effect, they become a
          new superpower. The world needs
          Robert Fischer to change his mind.

                    EAMES
          That's where we come in. How's
          Robert Fischer's relationship to
          his father?

                    SAITO
          Rumor is the relationship is
          complicated.

                    COBB
          We'll need more than rumor, Mr.
          Saito.

Eames picks up a photo: a distinguished executive (68).

                     EAMES
          Can you get me access to him?
          Browning. Fischer senior's right-
          hand man. Fischer junior's
          godfather.
                                                        49.

                    SAITO
          It should be possible. If you can
          get the right references.

                    EAMES
          References are something of a
          specialty for me, Mr. Saito.

EXT. DECREPIT BUILDING, MOMBASA - LATER

Eames leads Cobb and Saito down uneven steps to a doorway.

INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

Peeling paint, buzzing flies. They ascend to a dusty,
wire-reinforced glass door which Eames pushes open-



INT. PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS

Row upon row of wooden shelves holding hundreds of dusty
glass bottles of all shapes and colors. At the far end, a
portly 40-year-old man rises from behind his desk, beckoning.
This is YUSUF.

                    YUSUF
          Come, come.

Eames shakes Yusuf's hand. Yusuf stops at Cobb.

                    YUSUF
          Ah, yes. Mr. Cobb. I've heard so
          very much about you.
              (indicates chairs)
          please.

Yusuf chases a CAT off Saito's chair.

                    YUSUF
          Bloody cats.

Yusuf moves to a shelf and runs his fingers over the glass
bottles. None of them has a label.

                    YUSUF
          You work using Somnacin, I think,
          Mr. Cobb?

                    COBB
          You're well informed, Mr. Yusuf.

Yusuf places a bottle on the desk in front of Cobb.
                                                         50.

                    COBB
              (dubious)
          Somnacin?

                    YUSUF
              (proudly)
          Yusuf's Somnacin.

Yusuf pulls the stopper, holds it towards Cobb's nose.

                    COBB
          As good as the real thing?

Yusuf WHIPS the bottle away from Cobb, offended.

                       YUSUF
          Better.

Yusuf holds the bottle to the light, marveling.

                    YUSUF
          Binds the dreamers tight. Let's
          them dream as one. Makes it real.
          Of course, if you'd prefer, you
          could use Somnacin brand. If you
          could explain to the international
          control council what you wanted it
          for.

Yusuf puts the bottle back onto the shelf. Sits.

                    YUSUF
          You are seeking a chemist?
              (Cobb nods)
          To formulate compounds for a job?

                    COBB
          And to come into the held with us.

                    YUSUF
          I rarely go into the held, Mr.
          Cobb.

                    COBB
          We need you there to tailor
          compounds to our particular
          requirements.

                       YUSUF
          Which are?

                    COBB
          Great depth.

                    YUSUF
          A dream within a dream? Two levels?
                                                           51.

                      COBB
          Three.

                    YUSUF
          Not possible. That many dreams
          within dreams would be too
          unstable.

                    COBB
          I've done it before. You just have
          to add a sedative.

                    YUSUF
          A powerful sedative. How many team
          members?

                      COBB
          Five.

                      SAITO
          Six.
              (to Cobb)
          The only way to know you've done
          the job is if I go in with you.

                    COBB
          There's no room for tourists on
          these jobs, Mr. Saito.

                    SAITO
          This time, it would seem there is.

Cobb looks at him, uneasy. Yusuf pulls out another bottle.

                    YUSUF
          Of course. I use it every day.

Yusuf hands it to Cobb, who considers the white liquid
inside.

                      COBB
          For what?

Yusuf beckons them further into the pharmacy, to a METAL
DOOR. He STOPS- second thoughts.

                    YUSUF
          Perhaps... you will not want to
          see.

Cobb motions to continue. Yusuf pulls out a large key.
                                                        52.

INT. BACK ROOM, PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS

A dark room with ROWS of low COTS. Each with a sleeping
occupant. Tubes connect their wrists. An ELDERLY BALD MAN
watches over them.

                    EAMES
              (counting)
          Eighteen, twenty-all connected,
          bloody hell.

                    YUSUF
          They come every day. To share the
          dream.

Yusuf nods at the Elderly Bald Man, who moves to the nearest
bed. Reaches out to the OCCUPANT. Gives his face a FIRM SLAP.
The sleeper does not even stir.

                    YUSUF
          See? Very stable.

                    COBB
          How long do they dream?

                    YUSUF
          Three, four hours. Every day.

                    COBB
          How long in dream time?

                    YUSUF
          With this compound... about forty
          hours. Each and every day.

Saito surveys the room, appalled.

                    SAITO
          Why do they do it?

                    YUSUF
          Tell him, Mr. Cobb.

                    COBB
          After a while...
              (looks at Saito)
          It becomes the only way you can
          dream.

                    YUSUF
          Do you still dream, Mr. Cobb?

Cobb STARES at the sleepers. Uneasy.

                    EAMES
          They come here every day to sleep?
                                                        53.

                       ELDERLY BALD MAN (O.S.)
          No.

Cobb turns to the Elderly Bald Man, who looks fondly at his
dreamers.

                    ELDERLY BALD MAN
          They come to be woken up... the
          dream has become their reality...

The Elderly Bald Man pokes a crooked finger at Cobb's chest.

                    ELDERLY BALD MAN
          And who are you to say otherwise?

Cobb STARES at the Elderly Bald Man. DISTURBED. Cobb turns to
Yusuf. TOSSES him the bottle.

                    COBB
          Let's see what you can do.

INT. SAME - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb is lying on an empty cot, asleep. Yusuf stands over him.
As we move in on Cobb's SLEEPING FACE we hear the sound of a
FREIGHT TRAIN, BUILDING, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. WASTELAND - DAY

CLOSE ON Cobb's face as he lies, EYES CLOSED, cheek pressed
to a METAL RAIL- THE SOUND OF THE TRAIN IS DEAFENING- Cobb is
BREATHING, BREATHING, BREATHING, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. BACK ROOM, PHARMACY - DAY

Cobb's eyes open. Yusuf is watching him.

                       YUSUF
          Sharp, no?

Cobb nods. Gets to his feet, looking around-

INT. BATHROOM, PHARMACY - CONTINUOUS

Cobb SPLASHES water on his face, breathing hard- INSERT CUT:
A CURTAIN BILLOWS. MAL TURNS TO US, HAIR BLOWING, SMILING.
Cobb fumbles in his pockets, pulls out his spinning top. He
tries to set it spinning on the back edge of the sink, but it
FALLS to the floor and rolls towards the door- Saito is
there. WATCHING Cobb. He looks down at the spinning top.
                                                         54.

                    SAITO
          Everything alright, Mr. Cobb?

Cobb dries his face with a paper towel. Picks up his top.

                    COBB
          Everything's fine.

INT. BACK ROOM, WORKSHOP - NIGHT

Close on a small BRASS CHESS PIECE. Ariadne tips it over.
Frowning, she picks up a micro drill, peels back the felt on
the bottom and widens a hole in one side of its base. Tests
the TIPPING POINT again. A NOISE makes her look up.

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne comes into the main space. Someone is there,
unpacking one of the MECHANISMS. Cobb.

                    ARIADNE
          You're back.

Cobb looks up with a start. Caught out.

                    ARIADNE
          Are you going under on your own?

                    COBB
          I just-I need to test some things.
          I didn't realize anyone was here.

                    ARIADNE
          Just working on my totem.

Ariadne holds up the chess piece. Cobb reaches for it.

                    COBB
          Let me see-

Ariadne SNAPS it out of his reach. Smiles. Cobb nods.

                    COBB
          You're learning.

                    ARIADNE
          It's an elegant solution to keeping
          track of reality. Your invention?

                       COBB
          No. Mal's.

Cobb pulls out his spinning top. Looks at it.
                                                      55.

                    COBB
          This one was hers. She'd spin it in
          a dream and it would never topple.
          Just spin and spin...

                    ARIADNE
          Arthur told me she died.

                    COBB
          She did. How are the mazes coming?

Ariadne indicates three large ARCHITECTURAL MODELS.

                    ARIADNE
          Good. Each level relates to the
          part of the subject's subconscious
          we're trying to access. I'm making
          the bottom level a hospital, so
          that Fischer will bring his father
          there-

                    COBB
          Don't tell me. Remember, you only
          want the dreamer to know the
          layout.

                    ARIADNE
          Why's that so important?

                    COBB
          In case one of us brings in part of
          our subconscious. You wouldn't want
          any projections knowing the layout.

                    ARIADNE
          In case you bring Mal in.

Cobb says nothing.

                    ARIADNE
          You won't build yourself because if
          you know the maze, then she knows
          it. And she'd sabotage the
          operation. You can't keep her out,
          can you?

Cobb says nothing.

                    ARIADNE
          Do the others know?

                     COBB
          No.
                                                        56.

                    ARIADNE
          You have to warn them if it's
          getting worse-

                    COBB
              (gentle)
          I didn't say it's getting worse.
          Look, Ariadne, I need them for this
          job. I need you for this job.
          Without your help, I'll never get
          back to my children. And that's all
          I can care about right now.

                    ARIADNE
          Why can't you go home, Cobb?

Cobb looks at her, deciding what to say.

                    COBB
          They think I killed her.

                    ARIADNE
          How did she die?

Cobb thinks.

INSERT CUT: Mal, wind BLOWING her hair, smiles at Cobb. Now
we see Cobb- SHAKING HIS HEAD, TEARS STREAMING, BEGGING-
                       COBB
          Thank you.

                       ARIADNE
          For what?

                    COBB
          Not asking whether I did.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Ariadne, Arthur, Yusuf, Eames and Saito sit around the room,
looking at FILES. Cobb presides.

                    COBB
          The mark is Robert Fischer, heir to
          the Australian energy conglomerate,
          Fischer Morrow.

Cobb opens a large presentation pad.

                    COBB (reads aloud)
          "I WILL SPLIT UP MY FATHER'S
          EMPIRE."

Cobb turns to the team.
                                                  57.

                    COBB
          An idea Robert Fischer's conscious
          mind would never accept. We have to
          plant it deep in his subconscious.

                      ARTHUR
          How deep?

                    COBB
          Three levels down.

                    ARTHUR
          A dream within a dream within a
          dream? Is that even possible?

                    COBB
          Yes. It is.

                    COBB
          Now, the subconscious motivates
          through emotion, not reason, so we
          have to translate the idea into an
          emotional concept.

                    ARTHUR
          How do you translate a business
          strategy into an emotion?

                    COBB
          That's what we have to figure out.
          Robert and his father have a tense
          relationship. Worse, even, than the
          gossip columns have suggested...

                    EAMES
          Do you play on that? Suggest
          breaking up his father's company as
          a 'screw you' to the old man?

                    COBB
          No. Positive emotion trumps
          negative emotion every time. We
          yearn for people to be reconciled,
          for catharsis. We need positive
          emotional logic.

Eames thinks. Paces. Looking back at the board.

                    EAMES
          Try this... "MY FATHER ACCEPTS THAT
          I WANT TO CREATE FOR MYSELF, NOT
          FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS."

                    COBB
          That might work.
                                                         58.

                    ARTHUR
          Might? We'll have to do better than
          that.

                    EAMES
          Thanks for the contribution,
          Arthur.

                    ARTHUR
          Forgive me for wanting a little
          specificity, Eames.

                    COBB
          Inception's not about specificity.
          When we get inside his head, we're
          going to have to work with what we
          find.

Arthur shrugs, frustrated. And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY

The team are in the middle of a DESERTED intersection.
Ariadne is showing Yusuf aspects of the geography.

                    EAMES
          We could split the idea into
          emotional triggers, and use one on
          each level.

                    COBB
          How do you mean?

                    EAMES
          On the top level, we open up his
          relationship with his father....
          Say: "I WILL NOT FOLLOW IN MY
          FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS." Next level
          down we've accessed his ambition
          and self-esteem. We feed him: "I
          WILL CREATE SOMETHING MYSELF."
          Then, the bottom level, we bring
          out the emotional big guns...

                    COBB
          "MY FATHER DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE
          HIM."

                    EAMES
          That could do it.

                    ARTHUR
          How do you produce these emotional
          triggers?
                                                        59.

                    EAMES
          I forge each emotional concept in
          the style and manner of Peter
          Browning, a key figure in Fischer's
          emotional life.

Two AFRICAN PEDESTRIANS wander into view.

                    ARTHUR
          Are those yours?

Eames shakes his head. Cobb turns to Yusuf.

                    ARTHUR
          Yusuf?

                    YUSUF
          Yup. Sorry.

                    COBB
          Suppress them. We don't bring our
          own projections into the dream-we
          let Fischer's subconscious supply
          the people.

                    EAMES
          Saito, when do I get to see
          Browning?

                    SAITO
          You fly out to Sydney on Tuesday.
          We've arranged for you to spend
          several days...

INT. ANTEROOM, MAURICE FISCHER'S OFFICE - DAY

Eames sits in the crowded room. Boxes and files are piled
high. Browning stands by a pair of double doors.

                    SAITO (V.O.)
          ...as part of a consulting
          litigation team working for
          Browning.

                    BROWNING
          I'm not smelling settlement here-we
          take them down.

                    LAWYER
          Mr. Browning, Maurice Fischer's
          policy is always one of avoiding
          litigation-

Browning turns to the lawyer. Calm, but POWERFUL.
                                                           60.

                    BROWNING
          Shall we relay your concerns
          directly to Maurice?

Browning opens the doors to Maurice Fischer's inner office.
Eames leans in to watch as Browning beckons the Lawyer into-

INT. MAURICE FISCHER'S INNER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The office is a MAKESHIFT HOSPITAL ROOM: a BED where the desk
should be. Browning addresses a figure at the window. ROBERT
FISCHER, 30'S, abstracted.

                       BROWNING
          How is he?

Fischer turns to Browning. Motions silence, as he glances at
his FATHER in the bed. Wheezing gently.

                    BROWNING
          I don't want to bother him
          unnecessarily but I know he-

                     FATHER
          Robert! I've told you to keep out
          the damn!-

MAURICE LASHES OUT, KNOCKING things from his bedside table. A
NURSE calms Maurice as Fischer crouches to retrieve a FRAMED
PHOTOGRAPH. He looks at the photo through the broken glass- a
YOUNG BOY holds a PINWHEEL CLEARLY MADE BY A CHILD (each of
the points is numbered in pen), his FATHER blows on it.

                    BROWNING
          Must be a cherished memory of his-

                    FISCHER
          I put it by his bed. He hasn't even
          noticed.

                    BROWNING
          Robert, we have to talk about a
          power of attorney. I know this is
          hard for you, but it's important
          that we start to think about the
          future-

                    FISCHER
          Not now, Uncle Peter.

Browning looks at Fischer, considering. Biding his time.

                    EAMES (V.O.)
          The vultures are circling. The
          sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the
          stronger Peter Browning becomes...
                                                         61.

Eames WATCHES Browning, STUDYING his every move .

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Eames gestures at a mirror, as if offering to shake hands...

                    EAMES (V.O.)
          I've had time to learn Browning's
          physical presence and mannerisms...
In the mirror: BROWNING GESTURES BACK.

INT. WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

                    EAMES
          Now, in the dream, I can impersonate
          Browning and suggest the concepts to
          Fischer's conscious mind...
              (draws a diagram)
          Then we take Fischer down another
          level and his own subconscious
          feeds it right back to him.

                    ARTHUR
              (impressed)
          So he gives himself the idea.

                    EAMES
          Precisely. That's the only way
          to make it stick. It has to seem
          self-generated.

                    ARTHUR
          Eames, I'm impressed.

                    EAMES
          Your condescension, as always, is
          much appreciated, Arthur.

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. DESERTED HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

The team sit on the steps of the large marble lobby,
debating. Ariadne is showing Arthur the lobby.

                    EAMES
          He's not scheduled for surgery, no
          dental, nothing.

                    COBB
          I thought he had some knee thing?

                    EAMES
          Nothing they'd put him under for.
          Besides, we need a good ten hours.
                                                        62.

                    SAITO
          Sydney to Los Angeles.

They turn to Saito.

                    SAITO
          Twelve hours and forty-five
          minutes-one of the longest flights
          in the world. He makes it every two
          weeks...

EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY

Fischer steps out of a black town car and walks across the
tarmac towards a GULF STREAM JET, accompanied by two aides.

                    COBB (V.O.)
          Surely he flies private?

                    SAITO (V.O.)
          Not if there were unexpected
          maintenance with his plane.

Fischer is met at the steps by a DISTRAUGHT FLIGHT OFFICER.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

Cobb chews this over. Arthur comes over.

                    ARTHUR
          It'd have to be a 747.

                      COBB
          Why?

                     ARTHUR
          On a 747 the pilots are up above,
          first class is in the nose so
          nobody walks through the cabin.
          We'd have to buyout the whole
          cabin, and the first class flight
          attendant-

                    SAITO
          We bought the airline.

Everyone turns to Saito.

                    SAITO
          It seemed... neater.

                    COBB
          Neater, huh?
              (gets to his feet)
          Well, now we have ten uninterrupted
          hours.
                    (MORE)
                                                         63.
                    COBB (CONT'D)
              (to Ariadne)
          Nice lobby, by the way.

And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

The group is back in the workshop, deep in discussion.

                    ARTHUR
          My question is how we go down three
          layers with enough stability. Three
          layers down a little turbulence is
          gonna translate into an earthquake.
          The dreams are gonna collapse with
          the slightest disturbance.

Yusuf clears his throat.

                    YUSUF
          Sedation. For sleep stable enough to
          create three layers of dreaming...

INT. MAKESHIFT LAB - DAY

Yusuf depresses a plunger. Arthur is SLEEPING in a chair.

                    YUSUF (V.O.)
          We will have to combine it with an
          extremely powerful sedative....

Eames SLAPS Arthur, HARD. Arthur does not stir.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Arthur unconsciously rubs his cheek.

                    YUSUF
          The compound we'll be using to
          share the dream is an advanced
          Somnacin derivative. It creates a
          very clear connection between
          dreamers, whilst actually
          accelerating brain function.

                                                  CUT TO:

                    COBB
          Buying us more time in each level.

                    YUSUF
          Brain function in the dream will be
          about twenty times normal.
                    (MORE)
                                                          64.
                    YUSUF (CONT'D)
          And when you go into a dream within
          that dream the effect is
          compounded.

                    ARIADNE
          How much time?

                    YUSUF
          Three dreams... that's ten hours,
          times twenty, times twenty, times
          twenty...

                    EAMES
          Math was never my strong suit.

                    COBB
          It's basically a week one layer
          down, six months two layers down-

                    ARIADNE
          And ten years in the third level.
          Who wants to spend ten years in a
          dream?

                    YUSUF
          Depends on the dream.

                     EAMES
          It's not going to take us long to
          crack Fischer open once we get
          going. We'll be out in a couple
          days, max.

                     ARTHUR
          How do we get out once we've made
          the plant?
              (to Cobb)
          I hope you've got something a
          little more elegant in mind than
          shooting me in the head like last
          time.

Arthur tilts back in his chair. Yusuf turns to Cobb.

                    COBB
          A kick.

                    ARIADNE
          What's a kick?

Eames slips his foot under Arthur's chair leg. TIPS it-
Arthur's legs SHOOT UP INSTINCTIVELY for balance-

                    EAMES
          That, Ariadne, would be a kick.
                                                          65.

                    COBB
          That feeling of falling which snaps
          you awake. We use that to jolt
          ourselves awake once we're done.

                    ARTHUR
          But how are we going to feel that
          through the sedation?

                    YUSUF
          That's the clever part. I customize
          the sedative...

INT. MAKESHIFT LAB - DAY

Cobb, Eames and Yusuf watch Arthur, ASLEEP, in a chair.

                    YUSUF (O.S.)
          To leave inner ear function
          unimpaired...

Yusuf, with a wicked grin, slowly TIPS Arthur's chair
backwards... as he falls, Arthur's body JERKS, EYES OPENING
just before he HITS the floor.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Arthur thinks, nodding slowly.

                    YUSUF
          That way, however deep the sleep, the
          sleeper will still feel falling...

INT. MAKESHIFT LAB - DAY

Yusuf gleefully LEANS a SLEEPING ARTHUR to one side ...

                    YUSUF (V.O.)
          Or tipping...

Arthur goes down with a CRASH, JERKING AWAKE-

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Arthur thinks this through.

                    ARTHUR
          Even that won't cut through three
          layers of deep sleep.

                    COBB
          The trick is to devise a kick for
          each level, then synchronize them
          to get a snap that penetrates all
          three layers.
                                                        66.

Arthur looks at Cobb, getting it.

                    ARTHUR
          We can use the musical countdown to
          synchronize the different kicks.

INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT

Ariadne comes into the darkened main space. Cobb is lying on
one of the chairs, asleep. Plugged into the mechanism.
Ariadne stands over him. Watching.

She opens the case, PULLS one of the tubes, sits, checking
the dials as she injects the needle cap into her arm, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - DAY

Ariadne ascends. She looks at the buttons. Spots the "B." The
elevator STOPS. She looks through the grill at-

INT. YOUNG GIRL'S BEDROOM - DAY

Ariadne pulls back the grill and walks across the room,
considering the dusty furnishings. At the window is a doll's
house, front slightly ajar. Ariadne opens it. Inside is a
SAFE. She tries it. LOCKED. A NOISE STARTLES her- she turns,
looking through a doorway into another room...

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne looks into the room to see Cobb and Mal talking,
arguing. A private moment. Mal brushes at Cobb's hair, trying
to convince him. We hear snatches of conversation-

                     MAL
          You remember when you asked me to
          marry you?

                    COBB
          Of course...

                    MAL
          You said you had a dream...

                    COBB
          That we'd grow old together.

                    MAL
          And we can. You know how to find
          me... you know what you have to do.

Cobb is shaking his head, gently. Mal looks into Cobb's eyes-
gentle, loving... Mal SPOTS Ariadne spying on them.
                                                          67.

FREEZES, staring, hostile. Cobb turns, sees Ariadne, moves
towards her, leaving Mal.

                    COBB
          You shouldn't be in here.

Cobb guides her back into the elevator.

                    ARIADNE
          I wanted to know what "tests" you
          need to do on your own every night.

INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - DAY

Cobb shuts the CAGE DOOR. Ariadne hits a button. The elevator
RISES. Through the GRILL Ariadne can see a BEACH stretching
off into the distance. The elevator stops. Mal sits on the
sand. Beside her, the two children are crouched, away from
us, building a SANDCASTLE.

                    ARIADNE
          Why do you do this to yourself?

                    COBB
          This is the only way I can still
          dream.

                    ARIADNE
          Is it so important to dream?

Cobb stares at his family.

                    COBB
          In my dreams... we're still together.

The kids, WITHOUT TURNING AROUND, jump up and RUN AWAY.

INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

The elevator descends.

                    ARIADNE
          But these aren't just dreams, are
          they? They're memories. You said
          never to use memories.

                    COBB
          And I shouldn't.

                    ARIADNE
          You're keeping her alive.

                    COBB
          No.
                                                          68.

                    ARIADNE
          You can't let her go.

                    COBB
          No. These are moments I regret.
          Moments I turned into dreams so I
          could change them.

Ariadne's fingers move across the buttons- stop at the "B."

                    ARIADNE
          What've you got buried down there
          that you regret?

Cobb pushes her hand away. Hits the third floor button.

                    COBB
          There's only one thing I need you
          to understand about me...

INT. KITCHEN, COBB AND MAL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Ariadne follows Cobb into the kitchen. A THIN MAN is there,
standing by the table. He holds a FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER.

                    ARIADNE
          This is your house?

                    COBB
          Mine and Mal's.

                    ARIADNE
          Where is she?

                    COBB
          She'd already died.

The Thin Man offers Cobb the piece of paper. A CHILD'S SHOUT-
Cobb TURNS. Ariadne follows his gaze to the garden. A small
blonde boy faces away from them, crouched on his haunches to
look at something on the ground.

                    COBB
          It's James. My boy. He's found
          something. Maybe a worm.

A slightly older girl RUNS into view.

                    COBB
          And there's Philippa.

She crouches beside the boy. Their FACES ARE AWAY FROM US.
They point and discuss whatever is on the ground.
                                                        69.

                    COBB
          I thought about calling out, so
          they'd turn and smile those
          incredible smiles... but I'm out of
          time-

The Thin Man thrusts the paper into Cobb's hand.

                    THIN MAN
          Right now. Or never, Cobb.

Cobb nods, turns from the window-

                    COBB
          Then I panic that I'll always wish
          I'd seen them turn, that I can't
          waste this chance...

Cobb TURNS BACK to call out- but the children RACE OFF...

                    COBB
          But the moment's passed. And
          whatever I do, the dream's always
          the same... When I'm about to
          call... they run.

Cobb watches them run off, calling for grandma, FACES UNSEEN.

                    COBB
          If I'm going to see their faces
          again-I've got to get back here in
          the real world...

Behind him, Ariadne SLAMS the grill shut. Cobb TURNS.

INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne hits the BASEMENT button. The elevator starts to
DESCEND. ariadne STARES, fascinated as glimpses of floors
slip past: Mal's childhood bedroom, a thundering wall of
freight train... The elevator STOPS. Through the grill
Ariadne sees a HOTEL SUITE. She pulls open the grill, steps
cautiously out into-

INT. ELEGANT HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS (NOW NIGHT)

DISHEVELED bedclothes, UPENDED room service table,
STRAWBERRIES across the floor. A STRUGGLE. Ariadne steps
forwards- SMASH- she looks down to see that she has kicked
over a CHAMPAGNE FLUTE. Ariadne feels a draught. The CURTAIN
BILLOWS.

                    MAL (O.S.)
          What are you doing here?

Ariadne TURNS. Mal is there.
                                                        70.

                    ARIADNE
          My name is-

                    MAL
          I know who you are. What are you
          doing here?

                    ARIADNE
          I don't know. Trying to understand.

                    MAL
          How could you understand? Do you
          know what it is to be a lover? To
          be half of a whole?

                    ARIADNE
          No.

Mal moves slowly towards Ariadne...

                    MAL
          I'll tell you a riddle. You're
          waiting for a train. A train that
          will take you far away. You know
          where you hope this train will take
          you, but you don't know for sure...

Mal glides around Ariadne, looking her over.

                    MAL
          But... it doesn't matter. How can
          it not matter to you where that
          train will take you?

                    COBB (O.S.)
          Because you'll be together.

Cobb is standing in the elevator. Mal nods. Looks at him.

                    MAL
          How could you bring her here, Dom?

                    ARIADNE
          What is this place?

                    COBB
          A hotel. We spent our anniversaries
          in this suite.

                    ARIADNE
          What happened here?

Mal picks up the BROKEN STEM of a champagne flute...
                                                        71.

INT. CAGE STYLE ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Cobb PULLS Ariadne into the elevator- Mal THROWS herself
towards Ariadne- Cobb SLAMS the GRILL- Mal SMASHES against it
AGAIN and AGAIN like a WILD ANIMAL- Ariadne FLINCHES-

                     MAL
          you PROMISED! YOU SAID WE'D BE
          TOGETHER!-

                    COBB
          We can. We will. But I need you to
          stay here for now-

                    MAL
          YOU SAID WE'D GROW OLD TOGETHER!-

Cobb pushes a button and the elevator starts to rise.

                    COBB
          I'll come back. I need you to stay
          here on your own for now. Just
          while I do this job. Then we can be
          together-

                    MAL
          WE'LL BE TOGETHER-YOU PROMISED!-

Mal THROWS herself against the grill, and. we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. WORKSHOP - NIGHT

Ariadne watches Cobb sleeping. His eyes gradually flicker
open. He sees her watching him.

                    ARIADNE
          You think you can just build a
          prison of memories to lock her in?
          You think that's going to contain
          her?

The LIGHTS COME ON: Saito and Arthur stand in the doorway.

                    SAITO
          Maurice Fischer just died in Sydney.

                    COBB
          When's the funeral?

                    SAITO
          Thursday. In Los Angeles.
                                                        72.

                    COBB
          Robert'll accompany the body
          Tuesday at the outside. We have to
          move.

Cobb gets up. Ariadne comes over to him.

                    ARIADNE
              (low)
          I'm coming with you.

                    COBB
          No. I promised Miles.

                    ARIADNE
          The team needs someone in there who
          understands what you're struggling
          with. If you don't want it to be me
          then you need to show Arthur what I
          just saw.

Cobb looks at Ariadne. Turns to Saito.

                    COBB
          We need one more seat on the plane.

INT. DEPARTURE GATE, SYDNEY - DAY

Saito stands looking out the window at a 747. Cobb arrives
beside him. They watch a COFFIN being loaded.

                    COBB
          If I get on this plane and you
          haven't taken care of things...
          when we land I go to jail for the
          rest of my life.

                    SAITO
          Complete the job en route, I make
          one phone call from the plane...
          you will have no trouble clearing
          immigration.

INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - CONTINUOUS

The luxurious cabin has only ten seats. Cobb finds his- sees
Ariadne in the seat behind his. They do not acknowledge each
other. Behind her is Arthur, looking out the window. Eames
enters, STUFFS his bag into the overhead bin, BLOCKING the
passenger behind: ROBERT FISCHER, standing there, patient,
bag in hand, wearing black.

                       EAMES
          Oh, sorry.
                                                          73.

Eames SQUEEZES up against his seat to let Fischer BRUSH PAST.
Fischer moves to his seat, directly in front of Cobb. Eames
TOSSES Cobb a PASSPORT. Cobb flips it open: Fischer's.
Pockets it. Yusuf and Saito enter, take their seats.

EXT. RUNWAY - MOMENTS LATER

The 747 HURTLES down the runway.

INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb looks down at his hand: a TINY VIAL taped to the center
of his palm. He removes the cap. The seatbelt sign goes dark.
Cobb unbuckles, stands.

                       COBB
          Excuse me?

Fischer looks up.

                       FISCHER
          Yes?

                    COBB
          I think this is yours...

Cobb holds up the open passport, comparing the picture to
Fischer. Fischer's hand goes to his pocket. Cobb hands
Fischer the passport.

                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          Would you gentlemen care for a
          drink?

                       FISCHER
          Water.

                       COBB
          Same.

Fischer gives Cobb a thin smile. Holds up his passport.

                    FISCHER
          Well, thank you.

                    COBB
          No problem. Look, I couldn't help
          noticing your name. You're not
          related to Maurice Fischer?

Fischer takes a beat. But Cobb seems harmless.

                    FISCHER
          Actually, he was my father.
                                                        74.

                    COBB
          I'm very sorry for your loss. He
          was an inspiring figure.

The Flight Attendant brings their drinks- Cobb takes them.

                    COBB
          Thanks.

As he turns to Fischer he LOWERS his right hand ... a CLEAR
LIQUID DROPS into Fischer's water as Cobb hands it to him.

                    COBB
          To Maurice Fischer.
              (they drink)
          I'll leave you in peace.

Fischer grants him a smile.

EXT. 747 - LATER

The great plane SOARS through a burning cloudscape.

INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN, 747 - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb reaches into the overhead for a blanket- lets it fall
onto Fischer's head- Fischer doesn't flinch. ASLEEP. Cobb
SIGNALS the others. The First Flight Attendant unlocks a
CUPBOARD in the galley, then leaves, closing the curtain.
Arthur moves into the galley and pulls out a MECHANISM CASE.

Cobb and Arthur open the mechanism- uncoil the tubes- feed
them around the window side of each of the seats. Arthur
rolls up Fischer's cuff- PUSHES the needle cap into Fischer's
wrist. Arthur pulls Fischer's cuff down and hides the tubes
behind the armrest of Fischer's seat.

Arthur runs the next tube to Ariadne. Cobb puts the case on
Yusuf's lap. Yusuf checks the TIMERS, tapping the syringes.
The others recline their seats. Yusuf HITS A BUTTON- closes
the case- places it at his feet. He settles back, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. SEDAN - DAY

Cobb DRIVES. Saito and Arthur are in the back. Rain BEATS
down. Cobb pulls over-

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Yusuf stands on the corner, silver briefcase in hand, collar
turned up against the rain. He reaches for the door.
                                                          75.

INT. SEDAN - CONTINUOUS

Yusuf clambers into the back, brushing rain from his face.

                    ARTHUR
              (indicates rain)
          Couldn't you have peed before you
          went under?

                       YUSUF
          Sorry.

The front door OPENS and Eames climbs in, soaked.

                    EAMES
          Bit too much free champagne before
          takeoff, Yusuf?

                    YUSUF
          Ha bloody ha.

                    COBB
          At least we know he'll be looking
          for a cab in this.

INT./EXT. SEDAN ON RAINY NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Cobb pulls out into the heavy traffic. He weaves around
several cars before lining up behind a YELLOW CAB.

                    COBB
          Brace yourselves.

Cobb hits the gas- REAR ENDS the cab with a CRUNCH. The
CABDRIVER gets out, fuming. Heads to Cobb's window-

                    CABDRIVER
          Hey, asshole! Why don't you try
          driving without your thumb up-

He sees the SILENCED PISTOL Cobb is holding at his belly.

                       COBB
          Walk away.

The Cabdriver backs off. Arthur climbs into the cab. Both
cars pull away.

INT./EXT. CAB ON RAINY NEW YORK STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Arthur SLOWS in front of the TRAIN STATION, peering at the
pedes pedestrians. He SPOTS Fischer, lights the cab's sign.
Fischer FLAGS him down. Fischer JUMPS into the back, brushing
rain from his shoulders.
                                                           76.

                    FISCHER
          Third and Market. Snappy.

Eames JUMPS in from the other side.

                    FISCHER
          What're you doing?

                    EAMES
          Sorry, I thought it was free. Maybe
          we could share.

                       FISCHER
          Maybe not.

Saito gets into the front passenger seat. Pointing a gun.

                       FISCHER
          Great.

Arthur pulls away. Fischer pulls out his wallet and tosses it
at Eames.

                    FISCHER
              (contemptuous)
          There's 500 dollars in there. And
          the wallet's worth more than that.
          For that you ought to at least drop
          me at my stop.

Eames smiles at this.

                    EAMES
          I'm afraid-

A SHOT SHATTERS the window by Eames's head- another SHOT
IMPACTS by Saito-

                    EAMES
          Get us out of here!

Arthur hits the gas, but a BLACK S.U.V. SKIDS sideways in
front, BLOCKING the path-

A BLOCK BEHIND- Cobb is at a light. ARIADNE is getting in the
front. Cobb has HEARD the GUNFIRE-

                       COBB
          Come on!-

Cobb looks ahead to the AMBUSH, hits the gas- the sedan
ROCKETS forwards... but BAM- A FREIGHT TRAIN CLIPS THE FRONT
OF THE SEDAN, SHOVING IT SIDEWAYS AS AN ENDLESS TRAIN BARRELS
PAST, A WALL BETWEEN COBB AND THE AMBUSH-
                                                           77.

A SECOND S.U.V. is behind the cab- PLAIN CLOTHES SECURITY MEN
advance through the traffic, weapons trained on the cab.
Bullets RIP into the cab as Eames throws himself on top of
Fischer, PULLING a SACK over his head-

Inside the sedan, Ariadne watches the train passing-

                    ARIADNE
          This wasn't in the design-

Cobb BACKS UP, SPINS around, heading for the tail of the
train-

A Security Man emerges from the front S.U.V. carrying an
AUTOMATIC RIFLE- he steps towards the cab through the rain,
raises his weapon and BLASTS THE CAB'S WINDSCREEN-

Cobb clears the end of the train, and SKIDS across the tracks-

Arthur CROUCHES down- PUSHES the accelerator with his HAND-
YANKS the wheel- FLYING BLIND. The cab NAILS the Security
Man, CRUNCHING into the front S.U.V.-

Cobb SMASHES his car into the rear S.U.V., creating a GAP-

Arthur YANKS the transmission and REVERSES- SCRAPING through
the gap- Security Men DIVE out of the way- Arthur throws a
ragged J-turn to head down a SIDE STREET- Cobb follows in the
other car. Rain whips across Arthur's face as he BREATHES-

                    ARTHUR
          Everybody okay? Saito?

Arthur looks at Saito. Saito's hand is at his belly. Covered
in BLOOD.

EXT. WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

The sedan and cab pull into the side entrance- Eames jumps
out- PULLS the shutter down behind them-

INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Yusuf and Eames PULL Fischer from the cab, HUSTLING him
through a doorway. Cobb JUMPS out of the sedan, furious.

                    COBB
          Arthur! Arthur what the-

Arthur pulls the bloody Saito from the front seat.

                    COBB
          Oh, Christ. Is he dying?
                                        78.

          ARTHUR
I don't know. What happened back
there? Where were you?

          COBB
We were blocked by a freight train.

          ARTHUR
    (to Ariadne)
Why would you put a train crossing
in a downtown intersection?

             ARIADNE
I didn't.

          COBB
    (snaps)
Why were we all ambushed, Arthur?!
Those weren't regular projections-
they'd been trained!

          ARIADNE
How could they be trained?

          ARTHUR
Fischer's had an extractor teach
his mind to defend itself. His
subconscious is militarized. It
should've shown on the research-

          COBB
So why the hell didn't it?!

             ARTHUR
Calm down.

          COBB
Don't tell me to calm down-you were
meant to check Fischer's background
thoroughly. You can't make this
kind of mistake-we're not prepared
for this kind of violence-

          ARTHUR
Cobb, we've dealt with sub-security
before. We just have to be more-

          COBB
This wasn't part of the plan, Arthur!
    (points at Saito)
He's dying!

          EAMES
So we put him out of his misery.
                                                          79.

Eames steps into the room, pulls his gun and moves over
Saito.

                    COBB
          No.

                    EAMES
          He's in agony. Let's wake him up-

Cobb GRABS Eames's arm.

                    COBB
          No!
              (they lock eyes)
          It won't wake him up.

                    EAMES
          What do you mean, it won't wake
          him? When you die in a dream you
          wake up.

                    YUSUF
          Not from this. We're too heavily
          sedated to wake up that way.

Eames looks at Yusuf, then to Cobb.

                    EAMES
          So what happens if one of us dies?

                    COBB
          That person doesn't wake up. Their
          mind drops into Limbo.

                    ARIADNE
          Limbo?

                    ARTHUR
          Unconstructed dream space.

                    ARIADNE
          What's down there?

                    ARTHUR
          Raw, infinite subconscious. Nothing
          there but what was left behind by
          anyone on the team who's been trapped
          there before. On this team... just
          Cobb.

                    ARIADNE
          How long would we be stuck there?
                                                        80.

                    YUSUF
          You couldn't even think about
          trying to escape until the sedation
          eases-

                      EAMES
          How long?

                    YUSUF
          Decades-it could be infinite-I
          don't know! Ask him-he's the one
          who's been there before!

Eames moves to Cobb. Looks him in the eye.

                    EAMES
          Great. So now we're stuck in
          Fischer's mind battling it out with
          his private army, and if we get hit
          we're stuck in Limbo 'til our
          brains dissolve into scrambled egg?

Cobb says nothing. Saito groans more loudly.

                    ARTHUR
          Let's just get him upstairs.

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Saito is laid out on an old desk. Arthur examines him. He
motions to Ariadne. Eames watches Cobb.

                    ARTHUR
          Hold this. Firm pressure.

Arthur turns to Cobb.

                    ARTHUR
          You knew the risks and you didn't
          tell us.

                    COBB
          There wasn't meant to be any risk.
          We weren't supposed to be dealing
          with a load of gunnre.

                    ARTHUR
          You had no right.

                    COBB
          It's the only way you can go three
          layers deep, Arthur.

Arthur turns to Yusuf, hostile.
                                                81.

                    ARTHUR
          And you. You went along with this?

                    YUSUF
          I trusted him.

                    ARTHUR
          You trusted him? When? When he
          promised you half his share?

                    YUSUF
              (offended)
          No! His whole share. Plus, he told
          me he'd done it before.

Arthur turns to Cobb.

                    ARTHUR
          Oh, yeah? With Mal? That worked out
          great, didn't it, Cobb?

Cobb grabs Arthur.

                    COBB
          You don't know anything about that.
          This was the only way to do this
          job, Arthur. I did what I had to do
          to get back to my children.

                    EAMES
          So you led us into a war zone with
          no way out.

                    COBB
          We have a way out. The kick. We
          just have to push on, do the job as
          fast as possible and get out using
          the kick.

                    EAMES
          Forget it. We go any deeper, we
          just raise the stakes. I'm sitting
          it out on this level.

                    COBB
          You'll never make it, Eames.
          Fischer's security is surrounding
          this place as we speak. The ten
          hours of the flight is a week at
          this level-you'll never make it
          without getting killed. Downwards
          is the only way forwards. We have
          to carry on.

Saito groans. Cobb looks at him-
                                                           82.

                    COBB
          And we have to do it fast.

Eames and Arthur weigh this.

                    COBB
          Eames, go get ready. Arthur, let's
          get in there and soften him up.

INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - LATER

Cobb and Arthur, wearing BALACLAVAS, PULL the sack from
Fischer's head. He is chained to the radiator.

                    FISCHER
          I'm insured against kidnapping up
          to ten million-this'll be simple-

                    COBB
          No, it won't.

Fischer looks at Cobb, unnerved.

                    ARTHUR
          In. your lather's office, below the
          bookshelves, is his personal safe.
          We need the combination.

                    FISCHER
          I never noticed a safe-

                    COBB
          Doesn't mean you don't know the
          combination.

                    FISCHER
          Well, I don't.

                    ARTHUR
          We have it on good authority that
          you do.

                    FISCHER
          Whose?

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Yusuf looks through Fischer's wallet. Eames is opening a
HINGED, THREE-WING MIRROR.

                    YUSUF
          Five hundred dollars, this cost?

                    EAMES
          What's inside?
                                                        83.

                    YUSUF
          Cash, cards, ID... and this-

Yusuf holds up a SNAPSHOT: the photo from Maurice Fischer's
office- YOUNG ROBERT holds his HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, his FATHER
blows on it. Eames takes it from Yusuf. STUDIES it. Cobb
enters. Eames hands him the snapshot.

                    EAMES
          Useful?

Cobb studies the snapshot. Eames examines himself in the
hinged mirror from multiple angles: ONE BY ONE the myriad
Eames reflections BECOME BROWNINGS. Cobb pockets the photo.

                    COBB
          You're on. You've got an hour.

                    EAMES
          An hour? I was supposed to have all
          night to crack him.

                    COBB
          And Saito was supposed to keep his
          guts on the inside. You've got an
          hour-get something we can use.

Eames turns from the mirror AS BROWNING. He glances at his
watch, then SCREAMS, as if begging for mercy-

INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Browning's CRY reverberates- Fischer looks up, concerned-

                    FISCHER
          What's that?

                    ARTHUR
          Good authority.

Another cry rings out. Fischer recognizes the voice.

                    FISCHER
          Uncle Peter?! Make them stop-

                    ARTHUR
          The combination.

                    FISCHER
          I don't know it!

                    ARTHUR
          Why would Browning tell us you did?

                    FISCHER
          Let me talk to him-I'll find out.
                                                        84.

INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb pushes Browning (Eames), bloody and bruised, into the
room and forces him down next to Fischer. Cobb handcuffs
Browning's wrist to a metal bracket on the side of the sink.

                    COBB
          You've got an hour. Get talking.

Cobb leaves.

                    BROWNING (EAMES)
          They've had me for two days.
          They've got someone with access to
          your father's office and they're
          trying to open his safe-they
          thought I'd know the combination,
          but I don't-

                    FISCHER
          Neither do I, Uncle Peter.

                    BROWNING
              (confused)
          Maurice told me that after he
          passed only you would be able to
          open it.

                    FISCHER
          He never gave me the combination.

Browning thinks for a minute. Realizes something.

                    BROWNING
          He did, he just didn't tell you
          that it was a combination.

                    FISCHER
          What, then?

                    BROWNING
          Something only you would know. Some
          meaningful combination of numbers
          from your experiences with Maurice-

                    FISCHER
          We didn't have a lot of meaningful
          experiences together.

                    BROWNING
          Perhaps after your mother died...

                    FISCHER
          After my mother died, I went to him
          in my grief.

                    FISCHER (CONT'D)
          You know what he told me? "There's
          really nothing to be said, Robert."

                     BROWNING
          He always had a hard time with
          emotional-

                    FISCHER
          I was eleven, Uncle Peter.

Browning (Eames) takes this in.

                    BROWNING
          He loved you, Robert. In his way.

                    FISCHER
          "In his way?" At the end he called
          me to his deathbed. He could barely
          speak, but he took the trouble to
          say one last thing to me. He pulled
          me close... I could make out only
          one word. "Disappointed."

Browning can say nothing.

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Cobb pulls off his balaclava. Looks down at Saito, who is
breathing fast, shallow.

                    COBB
          How's he doing?

                    ARIADNE
          He's in a lot of pain.

Cobb takes Saito's hand. Looks him in the eye.

                    COBB
          When we get you down to the next
          level, the pain will be less
          intense.

Saito nods, breathing hard.

                    ARIADNE
              (low)
          And if he dies?

                    COBB
          His conscious mind will drop out of
          the dream. He'll be trapped in
          Limbo for a lifetime...

                    ARIADNE
          What will that do to him?

Cobb looks at her. Grave.

                    COBB
          When he wakes... his mind could be
          completely gone.

                    SAITO
          When... when we wake I will still
          honor our arrangement...

Cobb looks down at Saito sadly.

                    COBB
          Saito-san, when you wake you might
          not even remember that we had an
          arrangement. You'll have forgotten
          this world. Limbo will be your
          reality. Lost there so long, you'll
          have become an old man...

                    SAITO
          Filled with regret?

                    COBB
          Waiting to die alone. Yes.

                    SAITO
          Then I'll take the chance and come
          back. And we'll be young men
          together again.

Saito smiles weakly. Cobb nods at him, turns to Ariadne.

                    ARIADNE
          When were you trapped in Limbo?

Cobb says nothing. Ariadne pulls him away from Saito.

                    ARIADNE
          Cobb, you might have convinced the
          rest of this team to carry on with
          the job. But they don't know the
          truth.

                    COBB
          What truth?

                    ARIADNE
          The truth that at any minute you
          might bring a freight train through
          the wall. The truth that Mal is
          bursting up through your
          subconscious.

                                                         87.
                    ARIADNE (CONT'D)
          The truth that as we go deeper into
          Fischer, we're also going deeper
          into you-and I'm not sure we're
          going to like what we find there.

Cobb stares back at Ariadne. Saying nothing.

                    ARIADNE
          This is not just about Fischer,
          it's about you. Tell me what
          happened to you and Mal. Trapped in
          Limbo.

Cobb looks at her. Thinking it through.

                    COBB
          We were on a job. Exploring dreams
          within dreams. But we didn't
          understand how your mind can turn
          hours into years. How you can get
          trapped. Trapped so deep that when
          you wash up on the shore of your
          subconscious...

                    ARIADNE
          How long were you stuck?

Cobb pauses before he answers. Looks at Ariadne.

                    COBB
          Fifty years.

Ariadne stares at him, incredulous.

          It's not so bad at first, being

          it's not real. It became impossible
          for me to live like that.
                                                        88.

          She accepted it. At some point...

INT. MAL'S CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY

Mal opens a DOLL'S HOUSE. Inside is a SAFE. She opens it- it
is empty. She pulls out her SPINNING TOP.

                    COBB (V.O.)
          ...she'd decided to forget that our
          world wasn't real.

Mal places the top inside the safe. LOCKS IT AWAY...
INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

                    ARIADNE
          And when you finally woke up?

                    COBB
          To wake from that. From decades
          lived. To be old souls thrown back
          into youth. It was hard. At first
          Mal seemed okay. But I started to
          realize something was wrong.
          Finally she admitted it. This idea
          she was possessed by. This simple
          little idea that changed
          everything...

                    ARIADNE
          What was it?

                    COBB
          That our world was not real. No
          matter what I did, no matter what I
          said, she was convinced that we
          were still in a dream. That we
          needed to wake up again...

INT. COBB AND MAL'S KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Cobb is trying to calm Mal, who is hysterical.

                     COBB (V.O.)
          That to get home we'd have to kill
          ourselves.

INT. WORKSHOP - DAY

Ariadne looks at Cobb, appalled.
                                                          89.

                    ARIADNE
          What about your children?

Cobb has to look away.

                    COBB
          She... she believed they weren't
          real. That our real children were
          waiting. Somewhere above...

INT. COBB AND MAL'S KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Mal shakes her head at Cobb as he USHERS the children out of
the room, FACES UNSEEN-

                    COBB
          Calm down, Mal-

                    MAL
          They're projections, Dom. Your
          dreams. I'm their mother-don't you
          think I can tell the difference?

Cobb closes the door- turns to her, eyes full of bitter
tears.

                    COBB
          If it's my dream then why can't I
          control it? Why can't I stop this?

                    MAL
              (it's obvious)
          You don't know you're dreaming.

                    COBB
          You keep telling me I am-

                    MAL
          And you don't believe me!

                    COBB (V.O.)
          She was certain. But she loved me
          too much to go without me. So she
          made a plan...

INT. ELEGANT HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Cobb walks along, checking door numbers against a key.

                    COBB (V.O.)
          For our anniversary...

INT. ELEGANT HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)

Cobb enters the lavish suite. He notices the DISHEVELED
BEDCLOTHES.
                                                          90.

He steps forwards- SMASH- he has tipped over a champagne
glass with his foot... dinner for two is SPREAD ACROSS THE
FLOOR. He looks at the DEBRIS, confused... next to the broken
glass is a SPINNING TOP. He picks it up, studying it,
thinking. He feels a draught, looks to the window. The
CURTAIN BILLOWS.

EXT. EXTERIOR ATRIUM - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)

Cobb looks out the window: Mal sits on the ledge of the
opposite window. HAIR BLOWING. Feet dangling over the
dizzyingly high atrium. She smiles.

                     MAL
          Join me.

                    COBB
          Mal, come back inside.

                    MAL
          No. I'm going to jump. And you're
          coming with me.

                    COBB
          No, I'm not. This is real-if you
          jump, you're not going to wake up,
          you're going to die. Let's go back
          inside and talk about this, please.

                    MAL
          We've talked enough.

She KICKS off a shoe and watches it DROP.

                    MAL
          Come out onto the ledge or I'll
          jump right now.

She means it. Cobb swings his legs out, sitting on the ledge
opposite is wife. He looks down at the drop.

                    MAL
          I'm asking you to take a leap of
          faith.

                    COBB
          I can't do that, Mal. I can't leave
          our children.

                    MAL
          If I go without you, they'll take
          them away, anyway.

                    COBB
          What do you mean?
                                                           91.

                     MAL
          I filed a letter with our attorney.
          Explaining how I'm fearful for my
          safety, how you've threatened to
          kill me...

Cobb looks back at the wrecked hotel suite, PANICKING...

                    MAL (CONT'D)
          I love you, Dom. I've freed you
          from the guilt of choosing to leave
          them. We're going home to our real
          children.

                    COBB
          Out children are here, Mal.

Mal CLOSES HER EYES. Cobb looks for some way to reach her...

                    MAL
          You're waiting for a train...

                    COBB
          NO! MAL, NO, I CAN'T!

                    MAL
          A train that will take you far
          away...

                    COBB
          DON'T DO THIS!

                    MAL
          You know where you hope this train
          will take you, you can't know for
          sure...

                    COBB
          DON'T!

                    MAL
          But it doesn't matter...

                    COBB
          NO!

                    MAL
          Because you'll be together...

Mal SLIPS FORWARD INTO SPACE. Cobb SCREAMS after her. Then
tries to bury his face in the wall...

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - DAY

Cobb stares as he remembers.
                                                           92.

                    COBB
          He letter to the authorities
          refuted all the claims about her
          sanity that she knew I'd make...

INT. COBB AND MAL'S KITCHEN - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Cobb stands with the Thin Man, who has a piece of paper.

                    COBB (V.O.)
          She'd had herself declared sane by
          three different psychiatrists.

Cobb hears a SHOUT- turns to the garden. James CROUCHES,
Philippa joins him, examining the ground, FACES UNSEEN...

                    COBB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          It was impossible for me to explain
          the nature of her madness...

The Thin Man thrusts the paper into Cobb's hand.

                    THIN MAN
          Right now. Or never, Cobb.

Cobb turns back to the window- about to call out- James and
Philippa RUN OFF. Cobb turns from the window. Looks at the
paper in his hand. It is an AIRPLANE TICKET.

                    COBB (V.O.)
          So I ran. And I've been running
          ever since, trying to buy my way
          back to my family...

INT. OFFICE, WAREHOUSE - DAY

Cobb looks across at Ariadne.

                    ARIADNE
          Psychiatrists judged her sane?

                    COBB
          She was sane. She was just lost in
          the labyrinth.

                    ARIADNE
          Then why should you blame yourself?

                    COBB
          Because we were a family. And we
          had a life I would do anything to
          get back to now. But that reality
          wasn't enough for me then.
                                                        93.

                    ARIADNE
          It might have been your idea to
          push the limits, Cobb. But you're
          not responsible for the idea that
          destroyed her. The idea that her
          world wasn't real... that was her
          own idea from her own mind.

Cobb says nothing.

                    ARIADNE (CONT'D)
          Your guilt defines her. Powers her.
          If we're going to succeed in this,
          you're going to have to forgive
          yourself, and you're going to have
          to confront her. But you don't have
          to do it alone.

                    COBB
          You don't have to do this for me-

                    ARIADNE
          I'm doing it for the others. They
          don't know the risk they've taken
          coming in here with you.

Cobb looks at the rooftop opposite, sees a SNIPER take up a
position. Cobb shakes his head, frustrated.

                    COBB
          We can't stay here. Arthur?!

INT. BATHROOM, WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Browning puts his hand on Fischer's shoulder.

                    BROWNING
          These people are going to kill us
          if we don't give them the
          combination.

                    FISCHER
          They won't, they'll try to ransom
          us-

                    BROWNING
          I heard them-they're going to lock
          us in and run the can into the
          river.

                    FISCHER
          What is in the safe?
                                                           94.

                    BROWNING
          Something for you. Maurice always
          said it was his most previous
          gift... a will.

                    FISCHER
          Maurice's will is with Port and
          Dunn.

                    BROWNING
          It's an alternate. It supersedes
          the other only if you want it to.

                    FISCHER
          What does it say?

                    BROWNING
          It splits all the component
          businesses of Fischer Morrow into
          individual companies, transferring
          ownership to the boards of those
          companies...

                    FISCHER
          Leaving me nothing?

                    BROWNING
          A basic living. Nothing more. The
          entire empire would cease to exist.

                    FISCHER
          Destroy my own inheritance? Why
          would he suggest such a thing?

                    BROWNING
          I don't know, Robert.

Cobb OPENS the door. Arthur is behind him.

                    COBB
          Come to your senses?

                    FISCHER
          Let us go. I don't know the
          combination. Not consciously.

Cobb considers this. Opens his phone. Pulls out his gun.

                    COBB
          Let's try instinctively. I have
          someone standing in your father's
          office ready to tap in a
          combination.

He holds the phone to Fischer's mouth.
                                                           95.

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          First six numbers that come into
          your head. Right now.

                    FISCHER
          I have no idea-

Cobb SWINGS the gun onto Browning-

                       COBB
          RIGHT NOW!

                    FISCHER
          Five, two, eight... four, nine,
          one.

Cobb lowers his weapon. Listens to the phone. Shakes his
head. Shuts the phone.

                    COBB
          You'll have to do better. Bag `em.

Arthur puts SACKS over their heads.

INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Cobb and Arthur drag Fischer and Browning to the van-

                    FISCHER
          We're worth much more to you
          alive...

Arthur places Fischer on the back seat- uses a DROPPER to
drop LIQUID onto Fischer's mask- his head SLUMPS FORWARDS.
"Browning" yanks the sack from his head- it is now EAMES.

                    EAMES
              (excited)
          His relationship with his father's
          much worse that we thought.

                    ARTHUR
          That helps us?

Arthur pulls a SNIPER RIFLE from a case by the van.

                    COBB
          The stronger the issues, the more
          powerful the catharsis.

Cobb motions for Yusuf to follow his upstairs.

                    ARTHUR
          But how do you reconcile them if
          they're that estranged?
                                                           96.

                    EAMES
          I'm working on that.

Arthur lines up a shot through the window-

                    ARTHUR
          Well, work fast-Fischer's
          projections are closing in quick,
          we need to break out of here before
          we're totally boxed in...

Arthur SHOOTS two snipers. Cobb and Yusuf gently load Saito
into the van. He groans. Ariadne straps him in, checks his
bandages. Arthur can't get the last sniper- he's too hidden
behind a wall-

                    EAMES
          Shouldn't be afraid to dream a
          little bigger, Arthur-

Eames lines up a shot with a grenade launcher. Fires- the
sniper EXPLODES into the air- Arthur looks at Eames.

                      EAMES (CONT'D)
          Shall we?

They climb into the van-

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS - CONTINUOUS

The van pulls out into the rain-drenched streets. Arthur
opens the mechanism case and hands out tubes-

                    COBB
          Shifting Fischer's antipathy from
          his father onto Browning should
          work.

                    EAMES
          We need the imagery, the words...

                    ARIADNE
          So you destroy his one positive
          relationship?

                    COBB
          No. We repair his relationship with
          his father and expose his
          godfather's true nature.

                    EAMES
          Hell, we should be charging Fischer
          as much as Saito.
                                                        97.

                    ARTHUR
          What about his security? It's going
          to get worse as we go deeper.

                    COBB
          We bring in Mr. Charles.

                       ARTHUR
          No.

                    EAMES
          Who's Mr. Charles?

                    ARTHUR
          A bad idea.

                    COBB
          Arthur, the second we approach
          Fischer in that hotel, they're
          gonna mow us down-we run with Mr.
          Charles like on the Stein job.

                    EAMES
          So you've done it before?

                    ARTHUR
          Sure. But it didn't work. The
          subject realized he was dreaming
          and his subconscious tore us to
          pieces.

Eames takes this in.

                    EAMES
          You learned a lot, though. Right?

                    COBB
              (to Eames)
          I'll need a decoy.

                    EAMES
          No problem. How about a pretty
          young lady I've used before?

                       COBB
          Fine-

Cobb looks back: a second S.U.V. pulls out, tailing them.

                    COBB (CONT'D)
              (to Yusuf)
          I know you've got to stay ahead of
          them, but drive with kid gloves,
          okay? The world down there is going
          to be very unstable-
                                                        98.

                    ARTHUR
          And don't make the jump too soon-
          that kick is our only way back, we
          have to be ready to catch it-

                     YUSUF
          I'll use the music to let you know
          when it's coming, but the rest is
          up to you.

Arthur puts the mechanism onto the front seat.

                    YUSUF (CONT'D)
          Everyone ready?

Nods all round.

                    YUSUF (CONT'D)
          Sweet dreams-

Yusuf hits a button and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - SUNSET

Fischer nurses a drink. Staring at the ice cracking.

                    BLONDE (O.S.)
          Am I boring you?

Fischer looks up. A beautiful BLONDE is next to him.

                    BLONDE (CONT'D)
          I was telling you my story. I guess
          it wasn't to your liking.

                    FISCHER
          I have a lot on my mind.

Fischer looks around the bar. There are several STERN-LOOKING
CHARACTERS paying him too much attention.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Arthur and Ariadne sit at a table across the lobby. They spot
Cobb moving across the lobby towards Fischer.

                    ARTHUR
          And there goes Mr. Charles.

                    ARIADNE
          Who or what, exactly, is Mr.
          Charles?
                                                        99.

                    ARTHUR
          It's a gambit designed to turn
          Fischer against his own
          subconscious.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS

Cobb approaches the bar, watched closely by Fischer's Sub-
security.

                    COBB
          Mr. Fishcer! Good to see you again.
          Rod Green, Marketing.
              (to Blonde)
          And you must be...

                     BLONDE
          Leaving.

She presses against Fischer as she slides off her stool and
deposits a cocktail napkin in front of him.

                    BLONDE (CONT'D)
          In case you get bored.

Cobb watches her walk away. The Sub-security FOLLOWS her.

                    COBB
          I think you just got blown off...
          unless her phone number really does
          have only six digits.

Fischer glances at the napkin: "528-491."

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Arthur watches the Sub-security follow the Blonde.

                    ARIADNE
          And why don't you approve?

                    ARTHUR
          Because it involves telling the
          mark that he's dreaming. Which
          involves attracting a lot of
          attention to us.

                    ARIADNE
          Didn't Cobb say never to do that?

                    ARTHUR
          You must've noticed by now how much
          time Cobb spends doing things he
          says never to do.
                                                       100.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS

Cobb turns to Fischer.

                    COBB
          Strange way to make friends.
              (off look)
          Lifting your wallet, I mean.

Fischer pats his pocket. Empty. He looks to the lobby where
he sees the Sub-security trailing the Blonde.

                    FISCHER
          Goddamn it. The wallet alone's
          worth-

                    COBB
          Five hundred bucks. I know. Don't
          worry, my guys are on it.

                    FISCHER
          Who did you say you were?

Fischer looks at him, curious. Cobb plows on, confident-

                    COBB
          I said I was Rod Green from
          Marketing-but I'm not. My name is
          Mr. Charles. I might seem familiar
          to you. I'm in charge of your
          security here.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

The Blonde hurries up to Saito, emerging from the elevator-

                    BLONDE
          Mr. Saito, can I have a minute?

She pushes him back into the elevator, closing the door as
the Sub-security approaches...

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

The Blonde fondles Saito's lapels, getting close.

                    SAITO
          I'm sorry, but...

Saito glances over her shoulder to see, in the tunnel of
infinite reflections created by the elevator's opposing
mirrors, three reflections in, THE BLONDE IS EAMES. He winks.

                    SAITO (CONT'D)
              (pushing him away)
          Very amusing, Mr. Eames.
                                                       101.

                    EAMES
          You look a bit perkier.

A SHUDDER ripples through the elevator.

                    SAITO
          Turbulence on the plane.

                    EAMES
          Feels closer. That's Yusuf's
          driving.

And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY

Yusuf FIGHTS the wheel as the van CUTS DOWN AN ALLEY, BUMPING
OVER POTHOLES and SMASHING TRASH CANS aside- THREE S.U.V.s IN
FURIOUS PURSUIT. Yusuf looks in the rear view mirror,
FRUSTRATED. He checks his WATCH, then checks the back: the
SLEEPERS SHAKE with the impact and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - NIGHT

As a TREMOR echoes through the bar Fischer looks at Cobb
trying to place him.

                    FISCHER
          Security? You work for the hotel?

                    COBB
          No. My specialty is subconscious
          security.

                    FISCHER
          You're talking about dreams. You're
          talking about extraction.

                    COBB
          Exactly. My job is to protect
          you...

Behind Fischer a WAITER puts down a tray- tipping a champagne
glass over- SMASH- Cobb NOTICES. Pauses, looks across the bar-
HIS TWO CHILDREN ARE CROUCHED, BACKS TOWARDS US...

Cobb looks around the bar, the patrons start to STARE at
Cobb, suspicious- Cobb shifts back to Fischer-
                                                          102.

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          My job is to protect you from any
          attempt to access your mind through
          your dreams.

Cobb regains his patter- the patrons lose interest...

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Eames pulls out Fischer's wallet, moves to hand it to Saito,
then PAUSES, opens it, leafs past the cast to find... The
SNAPSHOT: young Robert holding his HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, his
father blowing on it. The elevator doors open and Eames steps
off. HANDS Saito the wallet.

                    EAMES
          Get off at a different floor and
          keep moving. Dump the wallet, then
          meet me in the lobby. The security
          will try to track it down. We need
          to buy Cobb a little more time.

The doors close. Saito puts the wallet in his pocket. He
COUGHS- a deep, nasty cough.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS

Cobb looks over Fischer's shoulder to see a SUITED MAN
watching him. Another MAN is walking in from the lobby.

                    COBB
          You're not safe here.

Cobb steps away from the bar. Fischer does not move.

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          Trust me. They're coming for you.

Fischer sizes him up, A CLAP OF THUNDER ECHOES, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY

GUNSHOTS BLAST out the rear and side windows of the van- a
Security Man is leaning out of the lead S.U.V. With a SHOTGUN-

WIND AND RAIN RIP THROUGH THE VAN- in the back, ARTHUR'S
SLEEPING FACE IS WHIPPED BY THE SPRAY, AND WE-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - SUNSET

Fischer looks out the windows at sudden, HURRICANE-LIKE RAIN-
                                                         103.

                    COBB
          Strange weather, huh?

A TREMOR runs through the bar- Cobb looks around-

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          You feel that?

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Ariadne and Arthur watch the GUSTS OF WIND RATTLE the
windows. Arthur sees HOTEL GUESTS staring out at the weather,
PUZZLED. Several of them TURN TO LOOK DIRECTLY AT ARTHUR.

                    ARIADNE
          What's happening?

                    ARTHUR
          Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention
          to the strangeness of the dream.
          That's making his subconscious look
          for the dreamer. For me.

And we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS - DAY

At the end of the alley-   Yusuf THROWS the van into a HARD
RIGHT TURN- we move into   EXTREME SLOW MOTION... THE SLEEPERS
IN THE BACK ARE DRAWN TO   ONE SIDE OF THE VAN BY THE
CENTRIFUGAL FORCE... and   we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - CONTINUOUS

The liquid in Fischer's drink RISES UP AGAINST ONE SIDE OF
THE GLASS- Fischer notices, confused.

                     COBB
          Very odd-the weather, the
          gravity...

Fischer looks around the bar- it's as if THE ENTIRE ROOM IS
SET AT A 45-DEGREE ANGLE- glasses SLIDING off tables...

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          But I can explain all this. You've
          actually been trained for this.
              (Fischer nods)
          Think of the strangeness of the
          weather, the shifts in gravity.
          None of this is real...
                    (MORE)
                                                         104.
                    COBB (CONT'D)
              (beat)
          We're in a dream.

Fischer looks at the room around them. Back to Cobb. All
through the bar, patrons turn to look at Cobb IN UNISON.

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          The simplest test of what I'm
          saying is for you to try and
          remember anything about the way you
          arrived in this hotel... okay?

Fischer stares at Cobb, trying to process this. All around
them, people STARE at Cobb. Several get up as if to approach.

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          Breathe. Remember the training.
          Accept the fact that we're in a
          dream. That's why I'm here
          protecting you.

As Fischer considers this we-

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS - DAY

Yusuf STRAIGHTENS UP the van, RACING down the street,
swerving through traffic and we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - EVENING

The building gradually EASES BACK INTO ALIGNMENT-

                    FISCHER
          So you... you're not real?

The bar patrons start to ignore Cobb again.

                    COBB
          No. I'm a projection of your
          subconscious. I was put in place to
          protect you in the event that
          extractors pulled you into a dream.
          I believe that's what has happened.

Fischer takes this in. Then looks at the Security Men
approaching across the crooked floor, he nods at Cobb-
                                                          105.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - EVENING

Cobb escorts Fischer across the lobby. As he does so, he
walks past the two CHILDREN, backs to us- Cobb ignores them-
The two Sub-security fall in behind. Cobb hurries Fischer up
the stairs- then PUSHES him into-

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Fischer stumbles in- turns to Cobb, angry-

                    FISCHER
          Hey-

Cobb reaches into his jacket- the First Man BURSTS in- Cobb
KICKS him to the ground- DRAWS his gun as the SECOND MAN
comes through the door, moving towards Fischer-

BLAM! Cobb BLASTS the Second Man in the back- TURNS and
SHOOTS the First Man.

                    FISCHER (CONT'D)
          Jesus Christ! What are you doing?!

Cobb turns to Fischer, calm. Convincing.

                    COBB
          Look at the gun in his hand.

Fischer looks: the Second Man was holding a pistol. Cobb
opens the First Man's jacket to show Fischer his holster and
sidearm.

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          These men were sent to abduct you.

Cobb pulls out the gun and HANDS it to Fischer.

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          If I'm going to help you, I need
          you to be calm.

Fischer remembers something.

                    FISCHER
          If this is a dream, I have to kill
          myself and wake up-

Fischer raises the gun towards his head-

                    COBB
          I wouldn't do that-they've probably
          got you sedated. If you pull that
          trigger, you might not wake up, you
          might drop into a lower dream
          state.

                    COBB (CONT'D)
          Mr. Fischer, you know all this, you
          just have to remember it...

Fischer lowers his gun.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Saito walks down the corridor, followed by a Security Man.
Saito DUCKS around the corner, moves to a GARBAGE CHUTE and
DROPS Fischer's WALLET into it. He SLIPS into the stairwell
as the Security Man comes abreast of the chute and pauses.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Arthur leads Ariadne to a particular room: 491.

INT. ROOM 491 - CONTINUOUS

Arthur leads Ariadne in. He opens the closet, opens the room
safe, pulls our FOUR BRICKS OF PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE.

                    ARTHUR
          So, if everything's correct, this
          room should be directly below 528.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Cobb looks reassuringly at Fischer.

                    COBB
          What do you remember from before
          this dream?

                    FISCHER
              (thinking)
          Rain... gunfire... Uncle Peter.
              (looks up)
          Christ-we've been kidnapped.

                    COBB
          Where were they holding you?

                    FISCHER
          They had us... in the back of a
          van...

                    COBB
          Your body's bouncing around in the
          back of a van right now-that
          explains the gravity shifts.

                    FISCHER
          It was... to do with a safe...
          Christ, why's it so hard to
          remember?
                                                        107.

                    COBB
          It's like trying to remember a
          dream after you've woken up. It
          takes years of practice to do it
          easily. So, you and Browning have
          been pulled into this dream so they
          can steal something from your mind.
          What?

                    FISCHER
          They wanted a combination to a
          safe... they demanded the first
          numbers to pop into my head.

                    COBB
          That's them extracting a locator.

                       FISCHER
          A locator?

                    COBB
          A number from your own
          subconscious. It can be used any
          number of ways...
              (thinking)
          This is a hotel. Room numbers. What
          was the number you gave them?

                    FISCHER
          5, 2... something... it was a long
          number. 528... 528, 4 something.

                    COBB
              (opens phone)
          Well, we know where to start.
              (into phone)
          Fifth floor.

INT. ROOM 491 - CONTINUOUS

Arthur hangs up the phone. He is standing on a chair,
attaching the explosives to the ceiling.

                    ARIADNE
          Do you use a timer?

                    ARTHUR
          No, I have to judge it myself. Once
          you're all asleep up in room 528, I
          wait `til Yusuf starts his kick...

                    ARIADNE
          How will you know?
                                                        108.

                    ARTHUR
          His music warns me it's coming,
          then the van hitting the barrier of
          the bridge should be unmistakable-
          that's when I blow the floor out
          from underneath us and we get a
          nice synchronized kick. Too soon,
          and we won't get pulled out; too
          late and I won't be able to drop
          us.

                       ARIADNE
          Why not?

                    ARTHUR
          The van will be in free fall. I
          can't drop us with no gravity.

Arthur finishes setting the charges.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Saito moves through the lobby. Browning is coming in the
other direction. Saito assumes him to be Eames.

                    SAITO
          I see you've changed.

                       BROWNING
          I'm sorry?

Eames comes up behind Browning, catching Saito's eye.

                    SAITO
          I'm... I mistook you for a friend.

                    BROWNING
          Good-looking fellow, I'm sure.

Browning moves off. Saito approaches Eames.

                    EAMES
          That's Fischer's projection of
          Browning. We'll keep an eye on how
          he behaves-

                       SAITO
          Why?

                    EAMES
          How he acts will tell us if
          Fischer's starting to suspect his
          motives the way we want him to.
                                                       109.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR, FIFTH FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

Cobb leads Fischer around a corner. Arthur and Ariadne are
waiting in the corridor.

                    COBB
          They work for me.

Fischer starts looking at room numbers. Stops at 528. Cobb
draws his gun, steps back from the door and KICKS it open.

INT. ROOM 528 - CONTINUOUS

Cobb JUMPS into the room, gun up. The room is empty. Arthur
and Ariadne search the room. Saito and Eames arrive. Eames
shuts the door. Arthur FINDS something-

                    ARTHUR
          Mr. Charles!

Arthur holds up a MECHANISM CASE. Cobb shows it to Fischer.

                    COBB
          You know what this is?

Fischer's eyes roam over the dials and plungers.

                    FISCHER
          I think so. But I don't understand.

                    COBB
          They were going to put you under.

                    FISCHER
          I'm already under.

                    COBB
          Under again.

                    FISCHER
          A dream within a dream?

                    ARTHUR
          Shhhh!

Arthur is at the door. Someone is there. A key goes into the
lock- the door starts to open- Arthur REACHES OVER and GRABS
the person entering, THROWS THEM TO THE FLOOR- puts his gun
in their face. IT IS BROWNING.

Fischer stares, disbelieving, at his own godfather.

                    FISCHER
          Uncle Peter. What's going on?

Cobb pulls the key from Browning's hand: ROOM 528.
                                                        110.

                    COBB
          You said you were kidnapped
          together?

                    FISCHER
          Not exactly, they already had him.
          They'd been torturing him...

                    COBB
          You saw them torture him?

Fischer shakes his head. Looks at Browning. Thinking.

                    FISCHER
          The kidnappers are working for you.

                    BROWNING
          No, Robert-

                    FISCHER
          You're trying to get that safe
          open. To get the alternate will.

Browning looks up at Fischer.

                    BROWNING
          Fischer Morrow's been my entire
          life. I can't let you destroy it.

                    FISCHER
          I'm not going to throw away my
          inheritance. Why would I?

                    BROWNING
          I couldn't take the chance of you
          rising to your father's final
          taunt.

                    FISCHER
          What taunt?

                    BROWNING
          That will. I'm sorry, Robert, but
          it's his final insult. A challenge
          to build something for yourself.
          He's telling you that you aren't
          worthy of his achievements.

Fischer takes this in. Devastated.

                    FISCHER
          That he was "disappointed?"
                                                       111.

                    BROWNING
          I'm so sorry. But he was wrong.
          You'll make his company even
          greater than he ever could.

                    COBB
          Your godfather's lying, Robert.

Fischer turns to Cobb.

                    FISCHER
          How do you know?

                     COBB
          It's what I do. He's hiding
          something.

Cobb looks at Browning.

                    COBB
          Let's find out what.

Cobb nods at Arthur, who starts unpacking the mechanism.
Browning watches. Silent.

                    COBB
          Let's do to him what he was going
          to do to you.

Cobb rolls up his sleeve. Nods at Fischer to do the same.

                    COBB
          We'll penetrate his subconscious
          and find out what he doesn't want
          you to know.

Fischer looks Cobb in the eye. Decides- rolls up his sleeve,
offering his bare arm. The team run tubes to each other-
Arthur injects Fischer, whose head slumps.

                      ARTHUR
          He's out.

                    ARIADNE
          Wait, Cobb-I'm lost. Whose
          subconscious are we going into?

                    COBB
          Fischer's. I told him it was
          Browning's so he'd come with us as
          part of our team.

                    ARTHUR
              (impressed)
          He's going to help us break into
          his own subconscious.
                                                       112.

                    COBB
          That's the idea. He'll think that
          his security is Browning's and
          fight them to learn the truth about
          his father.

Arthur hits buttons on the mechanism. The team goes out one
by one. Cobb is last.

                    COBB
          Fischer's subconscious is going to
          run you down hard.

                    ARTHUR
          I'll lead them on a merry chase.

                    COBB
          Be back in time for the kick.

                       ARTHUR
          I'm on it.

Cobb is no longer listening- he stares at the net curtains,
BILLOWING like those in Mal's suite- a GLIMPSE of someone
(Mal?) As the screen goes WHITE, and we are-

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - DAY

CLOSE ON Cobb's face, staring. Fixed.

                    ARIADNE (O.S.)
          Cobb? Cobb?

Ariadne is beside him. They stand on a cliff, dressed in
white snowsuits, carrying white-painted weapons like WWII
commandos. Cobb checks his SNIPER RIFLE, examines their
objective: a massive FORTIFIED MEDICAL FACILITY a mile below.

                    ARIADNE
          What's down there?

                    COBB
          Hopefully, the truth we want
          Fischer to learn.

                    ARIADNE
          I meant what's down there for you?

Cobb turns to her. Eames, Saito and Fischer arrive, SKIING
down from the hill above. Cobb pulls Eames out of Fischer's
earshot.

                    COBB
          You're the dreamer. I need you to
          draw the security away from the
          complex.
                                                       113.

                    EAMES
          Then who guides Fischer in? You?

                    COBB
          If I know the route... we could be
          compromised.

Eames looks as Cobb, uneasy. Ariadne comes over.

                    ARIADNE
          I designed the place.

                    COBB
          No. You're with me.

                    SAITO (O.S.)
          I could do it.

They turn to Saito. Saito shrugs at Eames. Eames smiles.

                    COBB
          Eames, brief Saito on the route
          into the complex. What we're
          looking for is going to be in the
          most heavily fortified section.
          That north tower.

Cobb moves to Fischer. Saito COUGHS. SPITS. Eames sees BLOOD
on the snow. Looks at Saito.

                     COBB
          Mr. Fischer, you're going in with
          Mr. Saito.

                    FISCHER
          You're not coming in?

                    COBB
          You have to do this on your own.
          You have to get in there, break
          into your godfather's mind and find
          out the truth about your father.

Cobb taps Fischer's radio mike.

                    COBB
          Keep this live at all times. I'll
          be listening in, covering you.
              (holds up the sniper
               rifle)
          The windows on the upper floors are
          big enough that I can cover you
          from that south tower.
                                                       114.

Cobb slips into his skis, shoulders his rifle.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. ROOM 528 - NIGHT

Arthur checks the mechanism. He hears LOW BOOMS like thunder.
He checks his watch- THE SECOND HAND CRAWLS FORWARDS. With a
last look at the sleepers, he heads out into the corridor...

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY

A GUNSHOT slams into the van as Yusuf DRIVES- he glances back
to see a MOTORCYCLE pulling up behind him, the REAR PASSENGER
FIRING A SHOTGUN- the bike pulls alongside Yusuf's window as
the passenger RELOADS- Yusuf YANKS the wheel TOWARDS the
bike, bringing the shotgun barrel into the cab so he can GRAB
it, spin the wheel back- PULLING the passenger from the back
of the bike... Yusuf turns a corner, heading into a disused
MARKET-

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Arthur walks towards the elevator. It OPENS- a SECURITY MAN
emerges, heading right for him. Arthur takes a TURN, speeding
up. The BOOMS are louder, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAY

The bike crosses behind the van, catching up again as the
driver pulls a handgun and starts BLASTING. Up ahead, an
S.U.V. sits in a side road, lining up to head off the van-
the SECURITY MAN driving the S.U.V. guns it, as the bike
creeps up on the other side of the van- Yusuf HITS THE
BRAKES, forcing the bike out into the path of the S.U.V.,
tossing the rider like a rag doll-

Heading out of the market, the van races onto a FREEWAY ON
RAMP, approaching the BRIDGE. An S.U.V. SMASHES into the
van's side, FORCING it up against a CRASH BARRIER... the van
starts to SLOWLY TILT OVER THE BARRIER as the S.U.V. PUSHES-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

As Arthur hurries down the corridor, the corridor starts to
TILT, and Arthur is forced to run UP ONTO THE WALL- he rounds
a corner- STRAIGHT INTO another Security Man- Arthur HEAD
BUTTS him and they STRUGGLE- as they struggle, the corridor
SPINS around, THROWING THEM UP ONTO THE WALLS, THE CEILING-
as wall becomes floor they DROP through a door into-
                                                          115.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The fight continues all over the spinning room- and we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY OFF RAMP NEAR BRIDGE - DAY

SLEEPING ARTHUR BOUNCES around as the van TILTS, SCRAPING
along the barrier- the van CLEARS THE END OF THE BARRIER AND
ROLLS DOWN THE EMBANKMENT, and we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Arthur and the Security Man DROP to the floor, Arthur on top.
Arthur gets up- heads to the stairwell.

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS NEAR BRIDGE - DAY

The van SETTLES with a thump. Yusuf BREATHES hard. Then
SMILES as he realizes he is in one piece. A RINGING BELL up

starting to come down. Yusuf checks his watch-

                    YUSUF
          Bugger.

Yusuf hits the gas, heading for the bridge. An S.U.V. lines
up behind him, trying to catch up before the van crosses the
barrier onto the bridge-

The van JUST MAKES IT- the S.U.V. behind RIPS its read axle
off, SCRAPING to a halt on the rising section. The Security
Man inside starts FIRING on the van...

INT. HOTEL STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

Arthur RACES down the steps- OPENS the door to the fourth
floor- spots SECURITY MEN outside room 491.

                    ARTHUR
          Hey!

They TURN- he DARTS back into the stairwell- RACES down the
stairs- the Security Men follow- they start SHOOTING, and we-

Eames SKIS down within sight of the hospital complex. He
reaches into his pack and lets off a FLARE.

Security Men on the ramparts spot the flare and send PATROLS

INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY RISING BRIDGE - DAY

Yusuf PULLS FORWARD, looking over his shoulder to line up a
BACKWARDS RUN at the edge. He DUCKS as vicious FIRE from the
S.U.V. HAMMERS the vehicle. He looks at his watch. The SECOND
HAND TICKING SLOWLY...

                    YUSUF
          Sod it. I hope your ready.

He grabs an MP3 player and reaches into the back to place
HEADPHONES on sleeping Arthur's head. As he does so, he
notices Saito's bandage BLEEDING THROUGH. Yusuf hits PLAY-
Edith Piaf's "Non, je ne regrette rien" starts up and we-

Arthur STOPS, hearing something- MASSIVE LOW-END MUSICAL
TONES- he looks up PANICKED-

          No, Yusuf. Too soon!

SHOTS slam into the stairs around him and we-

Cobb and Ariadne make their way down towards the complex.

          Cobb? Are you hearing that?

Cobb listens. The wind sounds unusually LOW.

EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Eames is hidden at the base of some trees, whispering as a
patrol passes beneath his position.
                                                        117.

                    EAMES
          I noticed it twenty minutes ago-at
          first I thought it was just wind...

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Cobb is listening intently. The "wind" changes pitch.

                    COBB
          No, it's music. Dammit.

Ariadne looks at Cobb, concerned.

          How long do we have?

                    COBB
          Yusuf's about ten seconds from the
          jump, which gives Arthur about
          three minutes, which gives us about-

                    ARIADNE
          Sixty minutes.

                    COBB
          The route you gave them, can they
          do it in under an hour?

                    ARIADNE
          I don't think so. They've still got
          to climb down to the middle
          terrace.

                    COBB
          They need a new route-a direct
          route.

                     ARIADNE
          The building's designed as a

                                                       118.

                    COBB
          There must be access routes that
          cut through the maze.

          Eames?

EXT. FOREST, SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Eames cannot answer- he SLALOMS through the forest, Sub-
security in hot pursuit, bullets smashing into the trunks...

EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

Cobb turns to Ariadne.

                    COBB
          Did Eames add any features?

                    ARIADNE
          Yes.

                    COBB
          What did he add?

Ariadne looks at Cobb.

                    ARIADNE
          I shouldn't tell you. If Mal-

                    COBB
          There's no time-what did he add?

                    ARIADNE
          Utility closets, trap doors...

                    COBB
          What about service features? Did he
          add any large pipes or-

                    ARIADNE
          Ducts. He added an air duct system-
          it doesn't follow the maze. They
          can use it to go straight from the
          outer walls to the upper tower.

                    COBB

Arthur RUNS UP the stairs, gun in hand- rounds a corner and-
IMPOSSIBLY- arrives behind the Security Man, who looks at
him, CONFUSED, then looks down to realize he is now at the
edge of a dangerous drop- Arthur shrugs.

                      ARTHUR
          Paradox.

Arthur PUSHES him over the edge- he falls- Arthur races up to

A MASSIVE RUMBLE prompts Cobb to look across the valley-

Eames shoots out of the trees, then FALLS to the snow as he
sees a great CRACKING up ahead- the SLOPE IS FALLING AWAY IN
AN AVALANCHE-

Cobb and Ariadne MOVE towards the base of the complex.

EXT. HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Saito and Fischer RUN around the base of the building. They
find a large EXHAUST PORT. Lay a charge on the GRILL. They
blow the charge. Climb into the open vent.

He PULLS the charges from the ceiling. Hurrying. And we-

Cobb GRABS a Security Guard from behind, strangling him
unconscious. He beckons to Ariadne, covering her as she runs
towards him. They enter the base of the south tower.

INT. TOP ROOM, SOUTH TOWER, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

A guard is manning the tower. Cobb and Ariadne enter- Cobb
SHOOTS the guard and moves to the window.

              (she points)
          That's the antechamber outside the

Cobb looks at the large windows of the antechamber.

                    COBB
          What about the strongroom? Doesn't
          it have any windows?

                    ARIADNE
          Wouldn't be very strong if it did.

          Look, if you wanted to design it
          yourself-

                    COBB
          It's fine. Better hope that we like
          what Fischer finds in there.

Cobb sets up his sniper rifle. Through the scope he can see
three guards on the balcony outside the chamber. Three more
inside. Cobb casually picks them off with his rifle. Ariadne
watches through binoculars, appalled.

                    ARIADNE
          These projections, they're part of
          his subconscious?

                                                       126.

                    EAMES
          What happened?

                    ARIADNE
          Mal killed Fischer-

                    COBB
          I wouldn't shoot her.

Eames grabs a defibrillator from the wall and pulls Fischer's
jacket open-

                    COBB
          It won't do any good-

Eames SHOCKS Fischer's chest...

                    COBB
          Even if you could revive his body,
          his mind's trapped down there. It's
          over.

Eames listens for a pulse. Looks up at Cobb.

                    EAMES
          So that it, then? We failed.

                       COBB
          I'm sorry.

                    EAMES
          It's you who doesn't get back to
          your family.

Eames looks down at Fischer. Then over to the double doors.

                    EAMES
          I wanted to know what was going to
          happen in there. I think we had
          this one.

                    ARIADNE
          There's still a way: We follow
          Fischer down-

They look at her.

                    EAMES
          We're almost out of time-

                    ARIADNE
          Down there they'll be enough time.
          We'll find him-soon as you hear
          Arthur's music start, you use the
          defibrillator to revive him-we give
          him his own early kick from below.
                    (MORE)
                                                       127.
                    ARIADNE (CONT'D)
          Get him in there-
              (points to doors)
          Then, as the music ends you blow
          the hospital and we all ride the
          kick back up through the layers.

Eames looks at her, then to Cobb.

                    EAMES
          Okay, Saito can hold them off while
          I plant the rest of the charges.

                    COBB
          Saito's not going to last, Eames.

                    ARIADNE
          We have to try!

                    EAMES
          Go for it, but I'm taking the kick
          whether you're back or not...

Eames pulls the mechanism from his pack. Offers it to
Ariadne. Cobb watches. Silent. Ariadne pulls out the tubes-

                    ARIADNE
          Can I trust you to do what's
          needed? Mal's down there-

                    COBB
          And I can find her. She'll have
          Fischer.

                    ARIADNE
          How do you know?

                    COBB
          She wants me to come after him. She
          wants me back down there with her.

Cobb rolls up his sleeve. Ariadne rolls up her own sleeve.
Eames NODS. Cobb and Ariadne lie down. Eames hits the button-
WATER. BUBBLES. DROWNING. And we are-

EXT. COAST (LIMBO) - DAY

Ariadne lies in the SURF, STARING up at a CLOUDLESS SKY. A
tremendous BOOM prompts her to look around her- URBAN
BUILDINGS PILED right down to the water. The buildings are
DECAYING, falling into the ocean like a GLACIER calving. Cobb
WADES towards her through the shallow water. Ariadne looks up
at the crumbling city around them.

                    ARIADNE
          This is your world?
                                                         128.

                    COBB
          It was. And this is where she'll
          be.

And we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - DAY

Arthur floats on top of the elevator, planting small charges
on the EMERGENCY BRAKES and CABLE. He sets them, GRABS the
other explosives, then PUSHES AWAY, shooting up the shaft. As
he hits the DETONATOR, BLASTING the braking and safety
systems of the elevator, we move into SLOW MOTION, the
fireballs FLAMING OUT in graceful licks and we-

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ANTECHAMBER - DAY

Eames RACES around, full speed- getting the defibrillator
paddles- laying them by Fischer's body- he runs into the duct-
pulls Saito up to a seated position and hands him a handgun.

                    EAMES
          Come on, Saito. I need you to cover
          Fischer while I plant the charges.

Saito nods weakly, tries to hold the gun. Eames moves to the
window- pulls his machine gun off- checks its load. Ready. He
watches the security patrols climb up the outer walls...
Eames lays down a HAIL of covering fire- then heads outside-

EXT. HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Eames races along the upper terrace dodging fire- BULLETS
SHATTER a window behind him and we move into SLOW MOTION, the
glass CASCADING GENTLY and we-

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. COAST (LIMBO)- DAY

Cobb and Ariadne climb out of the waves, full speed. They
move into the shadow of the tall, crumbling buildings. The
streets are eerily DESERTED. As they move further in, the
buildings become NEWER, different. Ariadne marvels at the
extraordinary collection of buildings- every architectural
style imaginable in waves of FAILED UTOPIAS.

                    ARIADNE
          You built all this?

                    COBB
          We both did.
                                                       129.

                    ARIADNE
          It's incredible.

                    COBB
          We built for years. Then, when that
          got stale, we started in on the
          memories.

A child's SHOUT echoes through the deserted canyons,
prompting Cobb to look down a side street: a LITTLE BLONDE
BOY crouched, his back to us. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the
boy, and, as Cobb turns down the street, they run off.

Cobb and Ariadne emerge into a peculiar SQUARE lined with an
eclectic mix of buildings, from APARTMENT BLOCKS to HOUSES.

                    COBB
          This is our neighborhood.

                    ARIADNE
              (confused)
          From what city?

                    COBB
          No. Our neighborhood.
              (pointing)
          That was our first apartment...
          then we moved to that building...
          we got that small house when Mal
          became pregnant.

                    ARIADNE
          You reconstructed them all from
          memory?

                    COBB
          We had time.

Cobb pauses in front of a French country house. Staring.

                    ARIADNE
          What's that?

                    COBB
          The house Mal grew up in.

                    ARIADNE
          Will she be in there?

                    COBB
          No. Come on-

Cobb leads Ariadne to the entrance of a glass skyscraper.
                                                        130.

INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY (LIMBO) - CONTINUOUS

Cobb leads Ariadne across the gleaming lobby to the
elevators.

                    COBB
          We both wanted a house, but we both
          loved skyscrapers. In the real
          world we had to choose. Not here.

INT. SKYSCRAPER ELEVATOR (LIMBO) - CONTINUOUS

Cobb pulls out his handgun, and a ziplock bag full of
bullets.

                    ARIADNE
          How do we send Fischer back?

                    COBB
          We need some kind of kick.

                    ARIADNE
          What?

                    COBB
          I'll improvise.

Cobb COCKS his weapon, and the ELEVATOR STOPS. The doors
open. Ariadne moves to exit, Cobb stops her.

                     COBB
          There's something you have to
          understand about me. About
          inception. You see, an idea is like
          a virus...

Cobb leads her out of the lift...

INT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - CONTINUOUS

Cobb and Ariadne step off the lift and into the incongruous
interior of a craftsman house. They cautiously move down the
corridor towards the back of the house...

                    COBB
          Resilient...
              (turns to Ariadne)
          Highly contagious, and an idea can
          grow. The smallest seed of an idea
          can grow to define or destroy your
          world...

Cobb is staring into the kitchen. Mal is sitting at the
table, back to them, staring out at the porch- the TOWERS of
Limbo stretching off behind it.
                                                        131.

                    MAL
          The smallest idea, such as... "Your
          world is not real."

Cobb hands Ariadne his gun and moves towards Mal.

                    MAL
          A simple little thought that
          changes everything...

Ariadne watches as Cobb sits down beside Mal. And we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

Arthur FLIES back down the shaft to the top of the elevator,
SQUEEZES past the car to the bottom and starts to set the
MAIN CHARGES ACROSS THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR, and we-

                                                    CUT TO:

INT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY

Cobb touches Mal's arm- she TURNS, angry. It is only now that
we see that she holds a CARVING KNIFE. Mal looks at Ariadne.

                     MAL
          So certain of your world. Of what's
          real. Do you think he is-
               (points at Cobb)
          Or do you think he's as lost as I
          was?

                    COBB
          I know what's real.

                    MAL
          What are the distinguishing
          characteristics of a dream? Mutable
          laws of physics? Tell that to the
          quantum physicists. Reappearance of
          the dead? What about heaven and
          hell? Persecution of the dreamer,
          the creator, the messiah? They
          crucified Christ, didn't they?

                    COBB
          I know what's real.

                    MAL
          No creeping doubts? Not feeling
          persecuted, Dom? Chased around the
          globe by anonymous corporations and
          police forces? The way the
          projections persecute the dreamer?
                                                       132.

Mal puts her hand on his face. Pitying.

                    MAL
          Admit it, Dom. You don't believe in
          one reality anymore. So choose.
          Choose your reality like I did.
          Choose to be here. Choose me.

                    COBB
              (rising anger)
          I have chosen, Mal. Our children. I
          have to get back to them. Because
          you left them. You left us.

                    MAL
          You're wrong, Dom. You're confused...
          our children are here-

A child's SHOUT draws Cobb- James CROUCHES on the porch, back
to us. Philippa joins him, also turned away. Cobb watches,
moved. Mal leans in close.

                    MAL
              (whispers)
          And you'd like to see their faces
          again, wouldn't you, Dom?

                    COBB
          Our real children are waiting for
          me up above.

And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

Arthur scrambles to arrange the sleepers on the floor of the
car- as his hand comes away from Saito, he sees BLOOD on it.
He looks at Saito's belly- the blood is coming through his
shirt. Arthur sticks headphones on sleeping Eames, and we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL FORTRESS - DAY

Eames throws a GRENADE, blowing up the security forces trying
to ascend the terraces. He DUCKS to the ground to avoid HEAVY
FIRE- starts unpacking the charges and setting them along the
base of the terraces-
                                                       133.

INT. DUCT SYSTEM, HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

Saito looks up as he hears a Security Guard climbing through
the duct... he raises his gun, TREMBLING with weakness...
And we-

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN, PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY

Mal laughs at Cobb.

                    MAL
              (laughs)
          Up above? Listen to yourself. You
          judged me for believing the very
          same thing.

Mal points at the children-

                    MAL
          These are our children. Watch.
              (turns to the kids)
          Hey, James! Philippa?!

The children START TO TURN to us- BUT COBB CLOSES HIS EYES.

                    COBB
          They're not real, Mal. Our real
          children are waiting for us-

The children run off. Cobb opens his eyes.

                    MAL
          You keep telling yourself that but
          you don't believe it-

                       COBB
          I know it-

                    MAL
          And what if you're wrong? What if
          I'm what's real?

Cobb is silent.

                    MAL
          You keep telling yourself what you
          know... but what do you believe?
          What do you feel?

Cobb looks at Mal. Struggling.

                    COBB
          Guilt. I feel guilt. And however
          confused I might get.
                    (MORE)
                                                       134.
                    COBB (CONT'D)
          However lost I might seem... it's
          always there. Telling me something.
          Reminding me of the truth.

                    MAL
          What truth?

                    COBB
          That you were wrong to doubt our
          world. That the idea that drove you
          to question your reality was a
          lie...

                    MAL
          How could you know it was a lie?

                    COBB
          Because it was my lie.

                    MAL
              (realizing)
          Because you planted the idea in my
          mind.

                     COBB
          Because I performed inception on my
          own wife, then reaped the bitter
          rewards...

                    ARIADNE
          Why?

                    COBB
          We'd become lost in here. Living in
          a world of infinite possibilities.
          A world where we were gods. I
          realized we needed to escape, but
          she'd locked away her knowledge of
          the unreality of this world...

INSERT CUT: Mal opens the doll's house. Takes the spinning
top, lies it down in the safe. LOCKS IT AWAY.

                    COBB
          I couldn't make Mal understand that
          we needed to break free. To die. So
          I started to search our world...

Cobb turns to Mal, but keeps talking to Ariadne...

INSERT CUT: Cobb WANDERS the streets of Limbo...

                    COBB
          Searching for the right place in
          her mind...
                                                          135.

INSERT CUT: Cobb stops outside the VICTORIAN HOUSE, MAL'S
CHILDHOOD HOME, looking up at it. He heads inside...

                    COBB
          And when I found that place, that
          secret place where she had shut
          away her knowledge years before, I
          broke it open...

INSERT CUT: Cobb looks around Mal's childhood bedroom. Comes
to the doll's house...

                    COBB
          I broke into the deepest recess of
          her mind, to give her the simplest
          little idea.

INSERT CUT: Cobb throws open the safe doors. Sitting on the
shelf of the safe is a spinning top. On its side.

                    COBB
          A truth that she had once known,
          but had chosen to forget...

IT SPINS AND SPINS WITHOUT END. Cobb CLOSES THE DOOR of the

THROUGH WASTELAND.

                    COBB (V.O.)
          That death was a necessary escape.

They lie on the tracks looking into each other's eyes. Mal is
crying. Cobb takes her hand, reassuring. He starts to speak-

                    COBB
          You're waiting for a train. A train
          that will take you far away. You
          know where you hope this train will
          take you, but you can't know for
          sure. Yet it doesn't matter...

Mal looks at him across the railroad tracks. Replies-

                    MAL
          Because you'll be together.

The train comes, OBLITERATING the lovers.
Back in the present- Cobb looks into Mal's eyes. She is
crying.
                                                       136.

                    COBB
          I never thought that the idea I'd
          planted would grow in her mind like
          a cancer. That even after we woke...

INSERT CUT: Cobb looks around the HOTEL SUITE, confused. He
moves to the CURTAINS... Mal is on the ledge opposite.
                    COBB
          You'd continue to believe that your
          world was not real...

Crying, Mal nods-

                    MAL
          That death was the only escape?

INSERT CUT: Mal PLUNGES to her death.

                    MAL
          You killed me.

Cobb looks at Mal. Whispers-

                    COBB
          I was trying to save you-I'm sorry.

Mal comes in close to Cobb. Looks him over.

                    MAL
          You infected my mind. You betrayed
          me. But you can make amends. You
          can still keep your promise. We can
          still be together... right here. In
          our world. The world we built
          together.

          You can't have him.

Cobb stares at Mal. Mesmerized.

                    COBB
          If I stay, can she take him back?

          Fischer's on the porch.

Ariadne looks up as a LARGE BOLT OF LIGHTNING RIPS across the
sky... she looks down to see Fischer, BOUND AND BLOODY, lying
below the rail.

                    ARIADNE
          He's here. And it's time. But you
          have to come with us.

Another massive lightning strike flickers across the sky-

                    ARIADNE
          Cobb, I'm not going to let you lose
          yourself in here! You have to get
          back to your children!

                    COBB

                    ARIADNE
          You can't stay here to be with her-

Cobb turns from Mal. Looks at Ariadne.

                    COBB
          I'm not. Saito is dead by now. That
          means he's here. I have to stay
          here and find him.

Ariadne removes Fischer's gag- pulls him up, onto the rail.
Cobb looks back at Mal.

                    COBB
          I can't stay here to be with her
          because she's not real.

Mal looks at Cobb, furious.

                    MAL
          Not real? I'm the only thing you do
          believe in anymore. Here-doesn't
          this feel real, Dom?

She STABS him in the chest- Cobb WHEEZES- GASPING, looking at
Mal-
                                                          139.

                    COBB
          I wish you were. But I couldn't
          make you real. I'm not capable of
          imagining you in all your
          complexity and... perfection. As
          you really were. You're the best I
          can do. And you're not real.

Mal pulls the knife and moves to STRIKE again-

          No!

A SHOT rings out, Mal GRABS her shoulder- Cobb turns to
Ariadne, who is pointing Cobb's gun.

          What're you doing?

                    ARIADNE
          Improvising.

She KICKS Fischer off the roof- AIMS again at Mal-

Fischer DROPS as the sky LIGHTS UP WITH ELECTRICITY- Fischer
SCREAMS, then GASPS, no longer falling, and we are-

Eames pulls the defibrillator from Fischer's chest as he

Fischer pushes open the doors to the STRONGROOM.

A RUMBLE BUILDS as Fischer approaches the bed, overcome with

The dying man SHAKES HIS HEAD with surprising energy.

The Father collapses back onto the pillow. Fischer starts to
weep. His Father reaches out a trembling hand but when
Fischer tries to hold IT, he SHAKES his son's hand away...

He is reaching for the SAFE next to his bed. His fingers
fumble at the keypad, he can't open it. His son pushes
5,2,8,4,9,1 into the keypad. Opens it. Inside the safe is the
WILL. And beside it is a HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, clearly made by a
child. By Fischer. He takes it out, MARVELING at it. He turns
to his father, but his father is dead.

Ariadne loosens her grip on the railing...

          Don't lose yourself. Find Saito.
          And bring him back.

Browning and DRAG him out.

Ariadne, Arthur and Yusuf wait calmly underwater. They are

Arthur turns to Saito. There is blood in the water around
Saito's belly- his eyes are LIFELESS- Arthur feels for a
pulse... turns to Cobb, whose eyes are lifeless... Ariadne
GRABS Arthur's elbow, pulling him away...

EXT. RIVERBANK - MOMENTS LATER

Fischer turns Browning/Eames over. They lie there, exhausted.

Fischer stares at the rain on the water.

Browning nods. Wipes the rain from his face. In the puddle
beside them, the reflection is not Browning, but Eames.

Cobb WOLFS his food. The Elderly Japanese Man (Saito, 90
years old) watches him.

          So... have you come to kill me?

Cobb does not look up.

                    SAITO
          I've been waiting for someone to
          come for me...

Saito peers at Cobb.

                    SAITO
          Cobb? Not possible-he and I were

          man...

                    COBB
          Filled with regret?

Saito REMEMBERS, nods...

                    SAITO
          Waiting to die alone, yes.

Cobb is STARING at something on the table.

                    COBB
          I came back for you... I came to
          remind you of what you once knew...

Cobb gestures at the table. Saito follows his gaze down to
the polished surface of the table...

                    COBB
          That this world is not real.

The top IS STILL SPINNING PERFECTLY, AS IF IT WILL NEVER
TOPPLE. Saito looks at the top. Then back to Cobb.

                    SAITO
          You came to convince me to honor
          our arrangement?

                    COBB
          Yes. And to take a leap of faith.

As Saito-san listens to Cobb, he looks at the GUN on the
table between them...

          Hot towel, sir?

His EYES FLICKER OPEN. He takes the towel with a nod. Ariadne
smiles. Relieved.

                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          We'll be landing in Los Angeles in
          about twenty minutes. Do you need
          immigration forms?

Cobb nods. Takes a landing card. Looks around the cabin.

Saito is WATCHING him. Serious. Haunted. Holding Cobb's gaze,
SAITO PICKS UP THE PHONE AND DIALS. Cobb nods thanks...

INT. ARRIVALS, LAX - LATER

Cobb steps forwards to the IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL. Hands him
his passport. Nervous. The Official takes a beat, looks Cobb
up and down, then WHUMP!- the passport is stamped. As Cobb
takes it back, he spots Ariadne at the next counter. She nods
at him. He nods back. Then moves off...

As Cobb passes through baggage claim, he exchanges subtle
greetings with Eames and Yusuf.

Arthur smiles broadly at Cobb. Cobb brushes past Fischer, who
glances back at him as if thinking maybe he should know him,

As Cobb emerges into the crowded arrivals hall, he spots
Professor Miles, waving at him...

INT. KITCHEN, COBB AND MAL'S HOUSE - DAY

Cobb enters with Miles. Drops his bags. Moves to the table,
looking out at the overgrown garden. He reaches into his
pocket, takes out his pewter spinning top, lowers it to the
table and SPINS IT- a CHILD'S SHOUT makes him look up-

Through the window, James and Philippa have run into view,
playing, THEIR FACES TURNED AWAY... Cobb STARES at the back
of his children's heads... Miles moves to the window and
KNOCKS on the glass-

James and Philippa TURN- see their Dad. He steps to the
window, watching their BRIGHT FACES SHINING as they run
towards him...

Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING.
And we-

FADE OUT.

          SPACE.
                         
          But not the dark lonely corner of it we're used to. This is
          a glittering inferno -- the center of a distant galaxy.
                         
          Suddenly, something TEARS past at incredible speed: a NEUTRON
          STAR. It SMASHES headlong through everything it encounters...
          planets, stars. Can anything stop this juggernaut?
                         
          Yes. Something looms at the heart of the galaxy, hidden
          inside the blinding starlight, a dark flaw in the fabric of
          existence itself: a BLACK HOLE.
                         
          The neutron star is pulled into the black hole's swirl,
          spiraling closer and closer to destruction. Finally, it
          contacts the hole's edge and EXPLODES.
                         
          The EXPLOSION is so powerful that it sends shock waves into
          the fabric of space-time itself. We ride one of these waves,
          racing back out from the black hole.
                         
          Suddenly, a portion of the wave disappears down a crystal-
          like hole, emerging in a much darker region of the universe --
          a backwater that, as the wave races past a giant red planet
          with a distinctive eye, we recognize as our own.
                         
          The wave, now just an infinitesimal ripple, finally reaches
          our blue planet. It drops into our atmosphere over North
          America, toward the high desert east of the Cascades, and
          through the roof of a nondescript warehouse.
                         
          The wave tickles the atoms in the steel shell of a vacuum
          chamber, then dances a tiny jig with a laser beam reflected
          in a heavy piece of glass.
                         
          The wave shoots back out of the building and disappears in
          the fractal branches of a tumbleweed resting against a
          concrete tube that stretches for miles in the desert.
                         
          An SUV speeds past the tumbleweed and we follow it till it
          parks at another plain-looking building at the opposite end
          of the tube. A MAN climbs out of the SUV.
                         
          INT. CONTROL ROOM, WAREHOUSE -- DAY
                         
          The man lets himself into a large room that looks like Mission
          Control. He pours himself a cup of coffee. It is the weekend
          and the place is empty. No one has been there to see the
          displays flashing a distinctive shape -- a pulse followed by
          a series of echoes.
                         
          The man looks up at the screen, then DROPS his cup of coffee.

          INT. LIGO OFFICES, CALTECH, PASADENA -- DAY
                         
          The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory
          headquarters at Caltech is a frenzy of activity. POSTDOCS
          and RESEARCHERS huddle around monitors and printouts, arguing.
                         
          ANSEN, 60s, the director of LIGO, walks through the frenzy.
          A postdoc hands him a printout: a pulse followed by echoes.
                         
          INT. LIGO DIRECTOR'S OFFICE, CALTECH -- DAY
                         
          Ansen steps into the relative calm of a large, sunlit office,
          which overlooks a grassy stretch of Caltech's campus.
                         
          His ASSISTANT, 30s, is on the phone, on hold. He looks up
          at Ansen as he enters.
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           I'm on hold with the INS.
                          (COVERS MICROPHONE)
           Don't you think we should double
           check the triangulation before we
                          CALL ANYBODY-
                         
                          ANSEN
           We have double checked it.
                         
          Someone finally picks up the line.
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           Yes. I'm trying to reach-
           (pause, listens)
           No, I don't think you understand how
           serious this is.
                          (PAUSE)
           Because if you did, we'd be having
           this conversation in person.
                         
          He listens for a moment, then hangs up the phone, confused.
                         
                          ANSEN
           What did they say?
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           They said we should look out the
           window.
                         
          Ansen steps to the window and looks out:
                         
          In the courtyard below, coeds are scrambling to get out of
          the way as a military helicopter sets down in the middle of
          the quad and dozens of ARMED FEDERAL AGENTS converge on his
          building.

          INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM, LIGO, CALTECH -- DAY
                         
          Ansen sits, alone, on one side of a conference table.
                         
          The other side is filled with GOVERNMENT MEN -- NSA mostly,
          some DIA. The door opens and his assistant steps in. Armed
          guards pat him down, then shove him into a seat.
                         
                          ANSEN
           Is that really necessary?
                         
          One of the NSA agents leans forward.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           You've been complaining for years
           that the government doesn't take
           your project seriously enough, Doctor.
                          (SMILES)
           You can't have it both ways.
                         
          Ansen motions to his assistant, who turns on a projector.
          On-screen, we see the familiar pulse and echoes.
                         
                          ANSEN
           Yesterday morning, our facility in
           Hanford identified this signal: a
           neutron star colliding with a
           supermassive black hole. We went
           through the last year's data and
           triangulated the source.
                         
          The pulse is translated into a crude animatic of a neutron
          star circling into the black hole.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           We know that, Doctor. What we don't
           know is why, according to your
           numbers, this event took place right
           here in our own solar system.
                         
          Suddenly, the image overlays the sun, the earth, and the
          rest of our solar system around the black hole.
                         
                          ANSEN
           It didn't. Because if it had we'd
           all be dead by now.
                         
          On-screen, Jupiter, then the Earth and the inner planets are
          consumed by the black hole. Only the sun survives, pulled
          into orbit around its new master.
                         
                          ANSEN (CONT'D)
           Which leaves only one explanation:
           The signal traveled through a
                          (MORE)

           wormhole. A gateway to a distant
           corner of the universe. The black
           hole is on the far side.
                         
          On-screen, the black hole system is removed to a distant
          corner, connected to ours by a tunnel through space-time. A
          gravity wave from the collision travels through the tunnel.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           I've read your book, Doctor. You
           said that wormholes are impossible.
                         
                          ANSEN
           There is nothing quite as satisfying
           as being proved utterly wrong.
                          (SMILES)
           I said that a wormhole couldn't exist
           naturally. Not for more than a few
           billionths of a second. It would
           have to be... stabilized.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           Stabilized by what?
                         
          Ansen pauses, unsure. His assistant steps in to his defense.
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           We don't have any way to answer that
           question.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
                          (IGNORES HIM)
           You're not under peer review here,
           Doctor. I don't care about your
           reputation. I need to know how that
           thing got there. Now.
                         
          Ansen finally speaks up.
                         
                          ANSEN
           If you're worried about an invasion,
           I would start drafting the articles
           of surrender.
                          (SMILES)
           Whoever they are, if they can build
           a wormhole, they could erase us in
           the blink of an eye. Luckily, that
           also means we have nothing they could
           be interested in.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           Then why is it there?
           5.
                         
                          ANSEN
           I don't know. Maybe it's an
           invitation. A chance to commune
           with an advanced species.
                         
          The assistant, embarrassed, looks down. The agent notices.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           You don't agree?
                         
                          ASSISTANT
                          (DELICATE)
           No. I don't think we can assume an
           alien intelligence built the wormhole.
                          (CHANGES TACK)
           But the opportunity it represents is
           incredible. We could explore parts
           of the universe we never dreamt of
           reaching in our lifetimes.
                         
          The agent exchanges a look with one of his colleagues, who
          steps out of the room.
                         
                          ANSEN
           We need to get back to work. I have
           a conference call with our European
           partners in fifteen minutes.
                         
                          NSA AGENT
           We severed the connections to your
           European partners this morning.
                         
                          ANSEN
                          (INDIGNANT)
           You can't do that. The Europeans
           put up some of the funding...
                         
                          GOVERNMENT MAN
           We'll send them a check.
                          (STANDS)
           Your project is now classified under
           the State Secrets Act.
                         
          He steps out the door, leaving the men alone. The assistant,
          outraged, turns back to his boss.
                         
                          ASSISTANT
           They can't keep this a secret. You
           know that. Sooner or later...
                         
          The younger man looks down, embarrassed, as he notices that
          tears are rolling down the older man's cheeks.

           I don't care about that. I've spent
           my whole life being afraid we would
           wipe ourselves out before this moment
           arrived. We've made so many mistakes,
           I wasn't sure we'd make it...
                         
          The assitant realizes that the old man is weeping for joy.

          SUPER TITLE: "FIFTY YEARS LATER"
                         
          A large old diesel tour bus is parked by the side of a dirt
          road, smoke pouring out of its open hood. A dozen MEN in
          BASEBALL UNIFORMS are standing around the front of the bus.
                         
          A battered PICKUP pulls up, and a MAN, 30s, gets out, leaving
          his two SONS in the car. This is COOPER. He joins the
          ballplayers staring at the lifeless diesel engine.
                         
                          BALLPLAYER
           Seized up on us.
                         
                          COOPER
           Long way to come by bus. I thought
           you guys would have a plane.
                         
                          BALLPLAYER
           We did. Ran out of parts for it.
           You know anything about diesels?
                         
                          COOPER
           A little.
                         
          Cooper steps to the engine compartment.
                         
          The ballplayer notices Cooper's two boys, TOM, 15, and MURPH,
          10, watching them. He wanders over.
           7.
                         
                          BALLPLAYER
           You think your dad's going to be
           able to help us out?
                         
          Murph, a filth-encrusted kid with a black eye, smiles at the
          ballplayer.
                         
                          MURPH
           My dad can fix anything.
                          (WRY SMILE)
           Except maybe your fastball.
                         
          The ballplayer frowns: smartass kid.
                         
          After a moment under the hood, Cooper signals to the driver,
          who tries the engine. It turns over once, then STARTS.
                         
                          BALLPLAYER
           Sure appreciate the help.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (SHRUGS)
           You don't make it, my boys won't get
           to see you lose.
                         
          The ballplayers load up into the bus and as it pulls away,
          we can see the logo painted across the back of the bus for
          the first time:
                         
          WORLD FAMOUS NEW YORK YANKEES
                         
          EXT. SPACE, NEAR EARTH ORBIT
                         
          Earth spins, lazily. From this height, it looks much the
          same as it has done for thousands of years.
                         
          Suddenly, a tiny black object appears, racing toward Earth.
                         
          The object SMASHES into a large satellite and races onward.
          Behind it, the satellite spins out of orbit in a cloud of
          fragments.
                         
          EXT. BASEBALL STADIUM -- NIGHT
                         
          An old minor league stadium. The stands are barely halfway
          full. Cooper, his boys, and Cooper's father-in-law, DONALD,
          60s, have a row to themselves behind the dugout.
                         
          Murph offers his grandpa some popcorn.
                         
                          DONALD
           Popcorn at a ball game is unnatural.
           I want a hot dog.
           8.
                         
                          MURPH
                          (CONFUSED)
           What's a hot dog?
                         
          Suddenly, play stops on the field below as the players and
          fans look up at the night sky:
                         
          A bright blue streak is tearing across it. It's beautiful.
                         
                          TOM
           Is that a comet, Dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           (shakes his head)
           Satellite. Big one. Probably
           Chinese.
                         
          Everyone watches the fireworks as the satellite burns up in
          the upper atmosphere.
                         
          After a moment, play resumes -- it's a pretty show, but
          everyone has seen it plenty of times before.
                         
          Down on the field, the Dodgers' catcher misses an easy pop
          fly and the Yankees load the bases. Donald looks disgusted.
                         
          INT. COOPER'S TRUCK -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper guides his truck along a potholed road. His father-
          in-law is riding shotgun; the boys are sleeping in the back.
                         
                          DONALD
           Those clowns would get their asses
           handed to them by the ballplayers I
           grew up watching.
                         
                          COOPER
           You ruin it for the boys when you
           talk like that.
                         
                          DONALD
           I'm not doing my grandkids any favors
           by lying to them. They're growing
           up watching lousy baseball.
                         
                          COOPER
           They didn't have any baseball at all
           when I was a kid.
                         
          That shuts the old man up for now. They drive on in silence.
                         
                          CUT TO:
           9.
                         
          EXT. FARMHOUSE -- MORNING
                         
          The sun is gently landing on the horizon, painting the sea
          of corn around Cooper's modest house gold. Cooper walks out
          of his house, still eating his breakfast.
                         
          Donald is on the porch, looking at a black clouds of smoke
          in the distance. The neighboring fields are BURNING.
                         
                          DONALD
           Nelson's burning up his crops. Found
           some of the blight on the okra.
                         
          Cooper watches the men walking through the fields, setting
          fire to the crop.
                         
                          COOPER
           I thought okra wasn't susceptible.
                         
                          DONALD
                          (SHRUGS)
           Better safe than sorry.
           (looks at him)
           You've got to take the boys to school.
                         
                          COOPER
           Something wrong with your truck?
                         
                          DONALD
                          (SMILES)
           Parent-teacher conference day.
                         
          Cooper bends his head in dismay.
                         
                          DONALD (CONT'D)
           Be nice to Murph's teacher. She's
           single, you know.
                         
                          COOPER
           What does that have to do with
           anything?
                         
                          DONALD
           We're supposed to be repopulating
           the earth. Gotta pull your weight.
           Besides, the boys could do with a
           woman in their lives.
                         
          The boys run out of the house and pile into the truck. Cooper
          pulls away before Donald can continue.
                         
          EXT. ROAD -- DAY
                         
          Cooper weaves the car along a dirt road. The kids are arguing
          over an ancient comic book in the back seat.
           10.
                         
          Cooper turns around to break it up.
                         
          BANG -- one of the tires blows out in a foot-deep pothole.
                         
          EXT. ROADSIDE -- DAY
                         
          Cooper examines the flattened tire. Looks at his older son.
                         
                          COOPER
           Get the spare, Tom.
                         
                          TOM
           That is the spare.
                         
                          COOPER
           All right. We'll use the patch kit.
                         
          He moves to the back of the truck. Murph suddenly looks
          very glum.
                         
                          MURPH
           I... I think the patch kit might not
           be there...
           (off his look)
           Because I was using it for my bike.
                         
          Cooper looks down at the dirt. Sighs.
                         
                          COOPER
           Murph's law.
                         
                          MURPH
                          (CONFUSED)
           What's that?
                         
          Tom snorts with laughter. Turns to his dad.
                         
                          TOM
           The kid doesn't even know what he
           was named after...
                         
          Cooper shoots Tom a look -- enough.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Murph's law means what can go wrong
           will go wrong.
                         
          Murph, looking hurt, walks off. Cooper turns to his son.
                         
                          COOPER
           Find something to patch it with.
                         
                          TOM
           How am I supposed to do that?
           11.
                         
                          COOPER
           Figure it out. I'm not always going
           to be here to help you.
                         
          Cooper leaves Tom to catch up with his younger son, who is
          looking out over the river.
                         
                          MURPH
           Is that really why I'm named Murph,
           dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           Listen to me. Murph's law doesn't
           mean that. It means what can happen
           will happen. All kinds of things.
           Good or bad. And that's the way you
           want it to be.
                         
                          MURPH
           Why?
                         
                          COOPER
           Because if nothing ever happened to
           you then you wouldn't learn anything.
                         
          Murph is staring off into the distance. He's heard something.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Murph?
                         
          Then Cooper hears it, too. A LOW RUMBLING SOUND. Cooper
          looks out over the river. Then he turns back and tackles
          his son to the ground.
                         
          Suddenly, a MASSIVE AIRPLANE SOARS overhead, so close they
          can almost touch it. It bounces the truck on its suspension,
          then soars off over the fields behind them.
                         
          Cooper grabs Murph and races back to the truck. He pulls a
          laptop and an antenna made out of a Pringles can out of the
          back of the truck. He hands the laptop and antenna to Murph.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Get in.
                         
          Tom is still standing by the side of the road, wrestling
          with the jack.
                         
                          TOM
           What about the tire?
                         
          INT. TRUCK -- MOMENTS LATER
                         
          The truck is SMASHING through the cornfields as fast as Cooper
          can push it on three good tires.
           12.
                         
          Murph is hurriedly firing up the laptop and connecting it to
          the directional antenna.
                         
          Cooper is straining to see through the cornstalks, scanning
          the horizon.
                         
                          TOM
                          OVER THERE-
                         
          To the right, the dark shape of the Russian drone appears,
          flying low over the fields. Cooper jerks the wheel--
                         
          EXT. RIVER -- DAY
                         
          The truck BURSTS out of the corn and SPLASHES across the
          river and into an old, abandoned suburban housing development
          in the valley below, planted over with corn.
                         
          Half a mile in front of them, the Russian drone is still
          hugging the ground. It has impossibly long, skinny wings,
          like an old U-2 surveillance plane, but no cockpit. The
          tops of its wings are covered in black solar cells.
                         
          INT. TRUCK -- DAY
                         
          Murph is fiddling with the computer. His older brother takes
          the computer from him and fires up emulation software.
                         
                          COOPER
           It's a Chinese military drone. Solar
           cells could power an entire farm.
                          (TO TOM)
           Take the wheel.
                         
          Cooper hands Murph the Pringles can antenna.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Keep it pointed right at it, OK?
                         
          Murph nods. Tom takes the wheel as his dad works the laptop,
          trying to communicate with the huge Russian drone. The screen
          fills with Cyrillic characters.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.
                         
          Tom WEAVES the truck at speed through the old, curved streets
          of the development, past oversized suburban mansions planted
          over with corn.
                         
          They round a corner and come face-to-face with a robot
          harvester. Tom jerks the wheel to avoid it.
                         
          BANG -- the truck loses a wing mirror against the flank of
          the combine.
           13.
                         
          EXT. SUBURBAN DEVELOPMENT -- DAY
                         
          Tom guides the truck from street to street, trying to chart
          a straight path across the fields. The truck BOUNCES as it
          SMASHES through an old picket fence.
                         
          Ahead, the drone is soaring, banking, pulling away.
                         
          INT. TRUCK -- DAY
                         
          Cooper is still trying to hack into the drone's control
          circuitry as they leave the development behind and begin to
          climb into the foothills of the Sierras.
                         
          EXT. RIDGELINE, HILLS -- DAY
                         
          Tom guides the truck along the spine of the hills. The drone
          soars overhead, making for the white tips of the Sierras.
                         
          INT. TRUCK -- DAY
                         
          Cooper is oblivious to the picturesque surroundings as he
          concentrates on the laptop.
                         
                          TOM
                          (UNSURE)
           Dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           Almost got it. Don't slow down.
                         
          In front of them, Tom and his brother watch as the drone
          plummets from view.
                         
                          TOM
           DAD.
                         
          Cooper looks up. Ahead, the trail disappears as the edge of
          the hills falls away -- it's a three hundred-foot drop.
                         
          Tom locks up the brakes.
                         
          EXT. RIDGELINE, HILLS -- DAY
                         
          The truck skids to a halt inches from a precipitous drop.
                         
          Cooper climbs out, holding the laptop. Murph climbs out
          next to him, still pointing the Pringles can.
                         
                          TOM
           We lost it.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (SMILING)
           No we didn't.
           14.
                         
          Suddenly, the drone SOARS back over them. Cooper types a
          couple keys and then moves his fingers across the trackpad.
          The huge drone banks and turns in response.
                         
          As the boys watch, Cooper sends the drone soaring high over
          them, banking and soaring along the tree-lined sides of the
          valley, light glinting from the black panels on its back.
          It's a beautiful sight.
                         
          Cooper crouches next to Murph.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           You want to give it a whirl?
                         
          Murph looks at his dad, wide-eyed. He takes the laptop and
          moves his fingers gingerly across the pad.
                         
          In response, the massive plane banks into a tight turn in
          the valley below.
                         
          For a moment, Murph is in pure heaven, sending the drone
          dancing through the valley below.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Set her down in the valley -- there,
           next to the river.
                         
          Murph leads the plane in a figure eight and then begins
          guiding it into a gentle landing in the valley floor below.
                         
          EXT. ABANDONED GOLF COURSE, VALLEY FLOOR -- DAY
                         
          The truck limps along the overgrown fairway of a long-defunct
          golf course towards the massive hulk of the Russian drone,
                         
          Cooper and the boys climb down. The valley is silent save
          for the truck's engine WHEEZING and SPUTTERING as it cools.
                         
          Cooper runs a hand over the smooth carbon flank of the drone.
                         
                          TOM
           How long do you think it's been up
           there, Dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           Chinese mission control went down
           same as us, twenty years ago. It's
           been up there ever since.
                         
                          TOM
           What was it doing flying so low?
                         
          Cooper reads the information pouring into his laptop.
           15.
                         
                          COOPER
           It was looking for something.
           Intercepted some kind of signal.
                          (SHRUGS)
           It's been at eighty thousand feet.
           Sun probably cooked its brain.
                         
          Cooper runs his hand along the flank till he finds an access
          patch. He pulls out a crowbar and pries open the hatch.
          Inside, surrounded by a nest of liquid cooling tubes, is a
          small black module -- the drone's auto-pilot.
                         
          Cooper looks down at Murph, who is standing at his elbow.
                         
                          MURPH
           What are you going to do with it?
                         
                          COOPER
           Reprogram it. Give it something
           socially responsible to do like drive
           a combine or a tractor.
                         
                          MURPH
                          (QUIET)
           Couldn't we just let it go? It's
           not hurting anyone.
                         
          Cooper looks down at his son. Good kid.
                         
                          COOPER
           We need all the help we can get,
           Murph. This thing has to adapt,
           just like the rest of us.
                         
          Cooper gently pries the control module out.
                         
          EXT. COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY
                         
          It's a small school, so all the kids and parents waiting in
          front know exactly who's driving the pickup truck with half
          of a Russian spy plane hanging out of the bed as it pulls up.
                         
          INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE, COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY
                         
          Cooper is ushered into the office. The PRINCIPAL, 40s, an
          efficient-looking man, shakes his hand.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           Good to see you, Mr. Cooper. This
           is Ms. Kelly, Murph's teacher.
                         
          Cooper smiles at Ms. KELLY, 30s, attractive.
           16.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
           So we've gotten Tom's score back.
           Congratulations. He's going to make
           an excellent farmer.
                         
          The principal slides a carbon copy across the desk to Cooper,
          who looks taken aback.
                         
                          COOPER
           What about college?
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           The University of California only
           accepts a few hundred students a
           year, Mr. Cooper. You have to be
           realistic.
                         
                          COOPER
           You're ruling out college for him
           now? He's only fifteen.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           I'm sorry. I'm afraid Tom's score
           simply isn't high enough.
                         
                          COOPER
           What are you, about a 36-inch waist?
                          (BEAT)
           30-inch inseam?
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           I'm not sure I see--
                         
                          COOPER
           You're telling me you need two numbers
           to measure your own ass, but just
           one to measure my son's future?
                         
          Ms. Kelly stifles a laugh, then, with a look from the
          principal, takes on the appropriate look of offense.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           I understand you're a well-educated
           man, Mr. Cooper. A scientist?
                         
                          COOPER
           Engineer.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           Frankly, the world doesn't need any
           more engineers. We didn't run out
           of trains or television sets or
           satellites.
                          (BEAT)
           We ran out of food.
           17.
                         
          Cooper leans back. He's not going to win this one.
                         
                          PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
           The world needs farmers, Mr. Cooper.
           And I'm sure your son Tom is going
           to make a fine one.
                          (SMILES BENIGNLY)
           We're a caretaker generation. But
           things are getting better. Maybe
           your grandchildren will be able to
           attend college.
                         
          Cooper looks down, swallowing his anger.
                         
                          COOPER
           Are we done?
                         
                          PRINCIPAL
           One more thing. Ms. Kelly here says
           that Murph brought a book to school
           about the lunar landings.
                         
          He slides an old textbook with a picture of a rocket on the
          cover across the desk to Cooper.
                         
                          COOPER
           One of my old textbooks. Murph liked
           the pictures.
                         
           MS. KELLY
           This is one of the old federal
           textbooks. We've replaced them with
           corrected versions.
                         
                          COOPER
           Corrected?
                         
           MS. KELLY
           The new textbooks explain that the
           Apollo lunar missions were faked in
           order to bankrupt the Soviet Union.
                         
                          COOPER
           You don't believe we went to the
           moon?
                         
           MS. KELLY
           I believe it was a brilliant piece
           of propaganda. The Soviets spent
           years trying to build rockets and
           other useless machines.
                         
                          COOPER
           "Useless machines"?
           18.
                         
          Cooper looks to the Principal for help. None is forthcoming.
                         
           MS. KELLY
           Yes, Mr. Cooper. The kind of
           wastefulness and excess that the
           20th century represented. Your
           children would be better off learning
           about this planet, rather than reading
           fantasies about leaving it.
                         
          Cooper is silent for a long moment.
                         
                          COOPER
           One of those useless machines they
           used to make was called an MRI. If
           we had any of them left the doctors
           might have been able to find the
           cyst in my wife's brain before she
           died, rather than afterwards. And
           then my kids could have been raised
           by two parents, instead of me and
           their pain-in-the-ass grandfather.
                         
          Ms. Kelly's face falls, ashen. Cooper swallows his anger.
          Most of it, anyway.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           You ever consider the best thing for
           the world and humanity might have
           been for us to part company?
                         
          Cooper gets up to leave.
                         
          INT. TRUCK, COUNTY SCHOOL PARKING LOT -- DAY
                         
          Cooper climbs into the truck, trying to hold it together.
          He PUNCHES the wheel.
                         
          The radio KEYS to life. He ignores it. Sits for a moment
          in misery. Finally he picks up the handset.

           you built him went haywire last night.
                         
                          COOPER
           Just tell him to power down the
           controllers for a couple minutes.
                         
           CB OPERATOR (O.S.)
           I did. He wants you to come down in
           person anyway. Says he found
           something you should take a look at.
           19.
                         
          Cooper stares at the wheel. Shakes his head in frustration.
                         
          EXT. AIRSTRIP -- DAY
                         
          Cooper pulls his truck up to a grimy-looking hangar. Pulls
          a tarp off of an ancient Piper Cub. Checks it over.
                         
          INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY
                         
          Cooper guides the plane along a long sliver of deserted beach.
          The radio crackles to life.
                         
                          COOPER
           Bravo-two-eight, requesting permission
           to enter your airspace.
                         
           AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (O.S.)
           Permission granted. Welcome to the
           sovereign nation of Texas.
                         
          Coop hangs up the radio. Banks the plane inland.
                         
          EXT. GULF COAST -- DAY
                         
          Below, a combine harvester fights its way up the dunes, trying
          to reach the beach, its wheels struggling for traction in
          the soft sand.
                         
          A MAN waves up at Cooper's plane as it circles overhead.
                         
          Cooper lands the plane on a deserted roadway. Jumps down.
                         
          He intercepts one of the combines as it trundles past, trying
          to reach the dunes. He pops open the cabin.
                         
          Inside is a mess of wires hooked into an auto-pilot not unlike
          the one he ripped out of the drone. He checks the fault
          code and resets the computer.
                         
          The man jogs over to meet him.
                         
                          RIGGS
           Thanks for coming down. Half of 'em
           took off last night, looking for
           something.
           (points to dunes)
           Looks like they found it, too. I
           thought you were the man to see it.
                         
          Riggs starts walking up the dune. Cooper follows.
                         
          Below, on the beach, a dozen more combines and other farming
          vehicles are lined up at the tideline, warm gulf water lapping
          at their metal flanks. They are circling a deep crater.
           20.
                         
          As they watch, an ancient autonomous SUB BEACHES itself,
          trying to reach the crater.
                         
          EXT. CRATER'S EDGE, BEACH -- DAY
                         
          Cooper steps between the waiting machines and peers down
          into the crater.
                         
          At the very bottom is a ROUND BLACK BALL, about a foot across --
          the same object we saw punch a hole in the side of a
          satellite. Every few seconds, it emits a distinctive CHIRP.
                         
          Cooper checks his rad meter. A tiny reading -- non-lethal.
          He takes off his watch and hands it to Riggs. Then he slides
          down into the hole.
                         
          The probe CHIRPS as Cooper slides down on top of it. He
          rubs a hand across its smooth composite bulk.
                         
                          RIGGS
                          (FROM ABOVE)
           You think it's an alien?
                         
          Cooper wipes sand off of the object, revealing the faint,
          familiar outline etched into the side of the probe:
                         
          The stars and stripes of the old federal government.
                         
                          COOPER
           Not exactly.
                         
          EXT. CRATER'S EDGE, BEACH -- DAY
                         
          Using a rope and a winch, Cooper hauls the blackened probe
          out of the crater and onto the beach.
                         
          Cooper hefts it up and carries it to the back of his plane.
                         
                          COOPER
           Space probe. Never seen one like
           it, though. Looks like it's been to
           hell and back.
                         
          The probe CHIRPS as Cooper belts it into the back.
                         
                          RIGGS
           How do you think it wound up here?
                         
                          COOPER
           Lost, I guess. Guidance satellites
           would have been shot down by the
           Chinese twenty years ago.
                         
          Cooper looks at the probe for a second, admiring its form.
           21.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Donald is pouring a bottle of corn beer into a bubbling vat
          of chowder. He turns to watch Cooper work, amused.
                         
          The probe has been clamped to the kitchen table. Cooper
          works at the blackened case with a BLOWTORCH. Cooper gives
          up -- the torch hasn't made a scratch. The probe CHIRPS.
                         
                          COOPER
           Well I don't know what the hell it's
           made of, but I can't crack it open.
                         
                          DONALD
           Good. Clear it off the table so I
           can serve dinner.
                         
          Tom and Murph walk in. Murph's got another black eye.
                         
                          DONALD (CONT'D)
           What happened this time?
                         
                          MURPH
           I got suspended. Paul said anyone
           who believed we went to the moon was
           an idiot. So I hit him.
                         
                          COOPER
           Good boy. Hand me the scanner.
                         
          Murph hands his dad a defibrillator he's modified for the
          purpose. He attaches the shock pads to the sides of the
          probe and turns on the power.
                         
          Numbers flash across the screen. Cooper hits a button on
          the controls and it PULSES.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Here we go. Standard NASA encryption.
           Memory's been damaged. Just noise.
           Hold on. I've got something.
                         
          Cooper unplugs a monitor from his computer and plugs it into
          the defibrillator. After a moment, an image fills the screen:
                         
          An ICE-COVERED PLANET nestled in the center of a system
          impossibly dense with stars. Murph stares, transfixed.
                         
                          MURPH
           Where is that, dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           I don't know.
                         
          Cooper looks at the probe.
           22.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Where the hell did you come from?
                         
          Cooper shrugs. Turns off the monitor.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           We'll take it down to Tyson's tomorrow
           and have it melted down. Might be
           some copper inside.
                         
                          MURPH
           But what about its mission? What
           about the information onboard?
                         
                          COOPER
           There's no one for it to report to.
           NASA is all gone. I'm sorry, son.
           It got home too late.
                         
          Donald pulls his chowder off the boil and slides the pot
          unceremoniously onto the table.
                         
          INT. DINING ROOM -- NIGHT
                         
          The boys have gone to bed. Cooper and Donald are alone at
          the table. Donald hands Cooper another beer.
                         
                          DONALD
           I heard your meeting at the school
           didn't go so well.
                         
          Cooper shakes his head in disgust.
                         
                          COOPER
           Maybe it's better for everyone to
           forget what they did back then.
           Reminds us how far we've fallen.
                         
                          DONALD
           (looks down,)
           When I was kid, it felt like they
           made something new every day. Some
           gadget or idea.
                          (SMILES)
           Like every day was Christmas.
                          (BEAT)
           But we made a lot of mistakes. Six
           billion people. Just try to imagine
           that. Every last one of them trying
           to have it all.
                         
          Donald rolls the bottle of beer in his hands.
           23.
                         
                          DONALD (CONT'D)
           The truth is this world isn't that
           bad. In a lot of ways its better.
           Tom will be all right, whether he
           goes to college or not.
                         
                          COOPER
           It doesn't bother me that he can't
           go. It bothers me that he doesn't
           care.
                         
                          DONALD
           Tom isn't the problem. He fits in
           this world just fine. You're the
           one who doesn't fit, Coop. You don't
           belong here. You were born forty
           years too late, or forty years too
           early -- I don't know. My daughter
           knew it, god bless her. And your
           kids know it, too.
                         
          Donald drains his beer. Walks to the screen door. Stops,
          one hand on the frame.
                         
                          DONALD (CONT'D)
           You were good at something and you
           never got a chance to do anything
           with it. And I'm sorry, Coop. But
           that's not your kids' fault.
                         
          Donald pushes out the screen door.
                         
          Cooper looks at his beer. The probe CHIRPS.
                         
          INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper flops down on his bed, fully clothed, exhausted. He
          stares up at the ceiling. This is his life.
                         
          INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          The air is filled with a PIERCING NOISE.
                         
          Cooper BOLTS upright. Stumbles out the door.
                         
          INT. HALLWAY, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper's boys are in the hallway, exhausted. Cooper, holding
          a baseball bat, makes his way down the stairs.
                         
          Cooper uses the bat to open the kitchen door.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper steps in, Murph watching from behind him.
           24.
                         
          The probe is clamped to the table, the chirp replaced with a
          DEAFENING SCREAM.
                         
          Cooper, holding his ears, moves closer to the probe. He
          hits it with the paddles. No result.
                         
          He SMASHES it with the bat. Nothing. He HITS it AGAIN and
          AGAIN. Finally, the clamps break off chunks of the table
          and the probe slams to the ground and ROLLS toward the front
          door. As it rolls, it STOPS SHRIEKING.
                         
          Cooper and the others watch it roll toward the door. It
          stops at the wall. After a second, it begins SHRIEKING AGAIN.
                         
          Cooper grabs it and rolls it toward the front door. Once
          again, the movement shuts it up.
                         
          EXT. PORCH, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper and his boys roll the probe out of the front door.
          It BUMPS down the front steps and comes to rest in the dirt.
          After a moment, the unholy RACKET starts up again.
                         
          Cooper keeps rolling it, but it doesn't seem to help. Murph
          looks up, sees the stars overhead.
                         
                          MURPH
           Try a different direction.
                         
          As they roll the probe in a circle, its SHRIEK stops, then
          picks up again. Cooper zeroes in on the direction that keeps
          it quiet -- southwest -- and pushes it along in the dirt.
                         
                          COOPER
           It's a fail-safe. It's going to
           annoy us into taking it home.
                         
          Cooper stops rolling the probe and, after a moment, it begins
          SHRIEKING again.
                         
                          TOM
           What are we going to do?
                         
          Cooper gets a rope.
                         
                          COOPER
           We're going to get some sleep.
                         
          He begins tying the rope around the probe.
                         
          INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          Cooper wakes. He's been sleeping with a pillow wrapped around
          his head. The SHRIEK can be heard, but it's muffled, distant.
           25.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          Tom heads off for school with Donald. Murph, still suspended,
          looks up at Cooper, smiling.
                         
                          MURPH
           What are we doing today?
                         
                          COOPER
           You're staying here and cleaning the
           house.
                         
          Murph looks crestfallen. He looks out towards the yard.
          Cooper follows his stare.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           I told you, Murph. There's no one
           to take it back to.
                         
                          MURPH
           But what if there is, dad? What if
           there's something we can salvage?
                         
          Cooper thinks it over. Murph scrambles to get his shoes.
                         
          EXT. COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          The shriek is still muffled. Cooper walks over to the well,
          putting in a pair of earplugs.
                         
          A line is staked off, leading down into the well below.
          Cooper begins hauling the line up.
                         
          As the probe breaks the surface of the water, the SHRIEK
          returns to its normal volume. Cooper rolls the probe out
          onto the ground.
                         
          INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY
                         
          The probe CHIRPS next to Murph in the backseat as Cooper
          spins the plane and guns the throttle and they bounce along
          the dusty runway and into the air.
                         
          EXT. CALIFORNIA COAST -- DAY
                         
          The tiny plane follows the mountains south.
                         
          EXT. SKIES OVER LOS ANGELES -- DAY
                         
          Cooper flies in low. Los Angeles looks much the same way it
          did in the early 20th century -- small settlements in Santa
          Monica and Downtown. Wildfires and earthquakes have shaken
          and burned what was left of the homes in between.
           26.
                         
          EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY, MALIBU -- DAY
                         
          Cooper puts the plane down on the old highway and taxis up
          to a gas station. Ahead, the Coast Highway peters out and
          disappears beneath rows of wild grass -- Malibu has become
          ranchland, once again.
                         
          EXT. GAS STATION, MALIBU -- DAY
                         
          An OLD MAN looks up as Cooper steps out of the plane and
          checks it over.
                         
                          COOPER
           Got any diesel?
                         
                          OLD MAN
           Plenty. Shame you can't eat it.
                         
          Cooper stretches the hose over to the plane.
                         
          INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY
                         
          Cooper rests a hand lightly on the controls as he follows
          the coast. Murph gazes out the window. In the backseat,
          the probe is HUMMING.
                         
          A light marine layer beneath them parts, revealing SANTA
          CRUZ ISLAND, a large, uninhabited island.
                         
          As Cooper soars over the island, the probe HUMS, insistent.
                         
                          MURPH
           I think it's home.
                         
          Cooper circles the island until he finds a long, flat
          grassland in the center of the island.
                         
          EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY
                         
          The plane bounces and hops to a halt in waist-deep grass.
                         
          Murph and Cooper climb down from the plane. Cooper slings a
          rifle over his shoulder.
                         
          A few dozen yards from the plane they reach the tree line.
          Murph stops, mesmerized by a patch of weeds studded with
          bright red -- strawberries.
                         
                          MURPH
           Dad, what are these things?
                         
                          COOPER
           I don't know. Don't touch them.
           27.
                         
          Cooper spots something in the foliage ahead that looks a
          little off. He walks over.
                         
          He pokes at the undergrowth with his rifle. The rifle CLANKS
          against something metal. Cooper reaches -- it's a camouflage
          scrim. He gently pulls it aside, revealing a chemical
          transport truck.
                         
          Cooper steps back, alarmed. He brings up his rifle.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Murph?
                         
          He looks around. Murph is nowhere to be seen. Cooper curses
          and heads into the forest to look for him.
                         
          EXT. CLEARING, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY
                         
          Cooper walks through a glade. He stops to get his bearings.
          Leans against a tree. Snatches his hand back -- the trunk
          of the tree is red hot.
                         
          Cooper steps back -- it's not a tree at all, but a camouflaged
          chimney stack. He looks up: the tree is venting steam.
                         
          Cooper walks a little further, until he finds several massive
          tanks. The tanks are filling with a bubbling liquid -- some
          kind of industrial process is taking place beneath him.
                         
          Cooper finally catches up with Murph at the edge of a
          clearing.
                         
                          COOPER
           Careful. There's some kind of
           underground facility here. We
           might...
                         
          Cooper notices his son is frozen, staring at something:
                         
          Standing bolt upright in the middle of the clearing, wearing
          an old straw hat, is an eight-foot-tall military spec ROBOT.
                         
                          MURPH
           Is it still... alive?
                         
                          COOPER
           Can't be. It's a marine. Haven't
           made them for thirty years. I've
           never seen one intact before.
                         
          Cooper steps closer to the robot, which is frozen. Its alloy
          frame heavily tarnished and weather-beaten. It looks like
          it might have been standing here for decades.
           28.
                         
          Cooper moves closer to it, looking into its blackened eyes.
          He steps back, clearly a little spooked.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           I think we need to go, Murph.
                         
                          MURPH
           But can't we take it back? You could
           fix it up, get him to do chores.
                         
                          COOPER
           No. I don't know what this place
           is, but we're leaving.
                         
          Murph, ignoring his father, steps forward to touch the robot.
                         
          Suddenly, the robot SPRINGS into action, picking up the boy
          and hoisting him up to eye level.
                         
          Cooper, stunned, points the rifle at the robot.
                         
          The robot turns, dropping the boy, RIPS the rifle from
          Cooper's hands, BENDS it, then SLAMS him up against the side
          of the water tank. Cooper punches him, then winces in agony.
                         
          Murph picks up the rifle and begins HITTING the robot as
          hard as he can. The robot opens his mouth and addresses
          Cooper calmly in the clipped tones of a US marine.
                         
                          ROBOT
           Tell the boy to stop hitting me.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (IGNORING HIM)
           Hit him in the back of the neck.
                         
          Murph raises the rifle butt. A voice stops him.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           I wouldn't do that.
                         
          A woman, 30s, step out from the trees. This is AMELIA BRAND --
          tough, bright, and a decent shot with the large rifle that
          she's pointing at Cooper.
                         
                          COOPER
           We were just looking for salvage.
                         
                          BRAND
           Is that what they call stealing these
           days?
                         
                          COOPER
           I didn't know it belonged to anyone.
           29. 
                         
                          BRAND
           It doesn't.
                          (TO ROBOT)
           You want to let them go, Tars, or do
           you want some help with your work?
                         
          The robot, evidently named Tars, looks at Cooper closely.
          Then lets him go.
                         
                          COOPER
           You've got me wrong, lady.
                         
                          BRAND
           Really? You're not the kind of guy
           who turns a combat marine with a
           supercomputer for a brain into a
           riding lawn mower?
                         
          Cooper says nothing -- she's not that far off the mark.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           Get back in your little plane, go
           back to your farming commune. And
           don't come back.
                         
          Cooper backs up. Tars holds up his mangled rifle. Smiles.
                         
                          TARS
           Don't forget your gun.
                         
                          COOPER
           (points at Tars)
           Word of advice -- careful with that
           thing. When the war was over, they
           didn't know when to stop fighting.
                         
                          BRAND
           I'd trust him a lot more than I'd
           trust you. Keep moving.
                         
          Cooper backs up to his plane. Tars follows him.
                         
          Suddenly, in the plane, the probe emits a high-pitch SQUEAL.
          Tars responds instantly, striding past Cooper to the plane.
          He sees the probe. Tries to open the door. It's locked.
                         
                          COOPER
           Wait a second--
                         
          Tars TEARS the door off the plane. Reaches inside and pulls
          out the probe. The woman looks at it, stunned.
                         
                          BRAND
           Get it inside.

           do with you later.
                         
          Tars stops, and two panels open in the ground, revealing a
          huge, reinforced service elevator.
                         
          INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR, UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY
                         
          Brand waves at a security camera and the lift begins to glide
          diagonally down a tunnel that cuts hundreds of feet below
          the island's surface. She keeps her weapon shouldered.
                         
                          COOPER
           Now who's stealing from who?
                         
                          BRAND
           This doesn't belong to you.
                         
                          COOPER
           You're right. It belongs to NASA,
           which shut down thirty years ago
           when the federal government ran out
           of money.
                         
          Brand says nothing. The elevator slows to a stop at the
          bottom of the tunnel. Heavy BLAST DOORS grind open and Brand
          motions for Cooper to step forward.
                         
          INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY
                         
          They step into a vast underground facility. Standing in the
          center, braced by a launch tower, is a ten story tall rocket.
          Dozens of ROBOTS are working on in, maintaining it.
                         
          Cooper, stunned, looks at Brand.

          Tars carries the probe over to an area of the hangar filled
          with electronic equipment. A group of ENGINEERS and ROBOTS
          converge around Tars.
                         
          An OLDER ENGINEER looks familiar -- 70s, white-haired, this
          is Ansen's assistant at Caltech who we met fifty years
          earlier.

           can't tell from the radiation damage.
                         
          The older engineer looks at the probe, astonished.
                         
                          OLD ENGINEER
           Where did you find it?
                         
                          COOPER
           Galveston.
                         
                          BRAND'S FATHER
           (thinking it over)
           Of course. It must have been looking
           for Canaveral.
                         
          Tars bolts the probe down into a purpose built rig. DOYLE,
          40s, an engineer, begins hooking leads into the probe.
                         
                          COOPER
           Canaveral's been gone for thirty
           years.
                         
          Brand ignores him.
                         
          Doyle looks up from his monitor, frustrated.
                         
                          DOYLE
           It's not responding to the handshake.
           I can't open anything on primary.
                         
          Brand looks up at Cooper.
                         
                          BRAND
           What did you do to it?
                         
                          COOPER
           Nothing. I got something off of it.
                         
          Cooper looks around. There's a safety station on the wall
          with a battery powered defibrillator.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
                          (TO BRAND)
           May I?
                         
          Brand nods, wary. Cooper walks over to the wall, takes the
          defibrillator, and hooks it up to the probe. He taps into
          the current and runs a lead into the terminal. Brand's Father
          watches, fascinated, as Cooper fires the defibrillator.
           32.
                         
                          OLD ENGINEER
           Of course. The high voltage allows
           you to image the entire memory unit
           at once.
                         
          Information begins appearing on the terminal's screen.
                         
                          COOPER
           Most of the disk was noise. Couple
           of clean sectors, though.
                         
          Suddenly, the monitor starts pulling good data off of the
          probe. The older man and Doyle begin sorting through it.
                         
          Cooper smiles at Brand, who seems less than impressed.
                         
          The footage of the ice-covered planet Cooper saw earlier
          pops onto the screen.
                         
          The engineers and physicists get very quiet, studying the
          images.
                         
                          DOYLE
           It found something.
                          (READING)
           Very thin nitrogen-based atmosphere.
           Trace radiation. Surface is ninety
           percent frozen water. Ten percent
           rock -- sedimentary composition
           similar to limestone.
                          (READING)
           Wow. Pockets of oxygen below the
           surface. Lots and lots of oxygen.
                          (EXCITED)
           This could be the one, boss.
                         
          The older engineer studies the image of the ice-covered
          planet, thinking.
                         
                          COOPER
           There aren't any planets like that
           anywhere near earth. Not even if
           this thing was gone for thirty years.
                         
          Brand looks at Cooper, appraising. She turns to the older
          engineer.
                         
                          BRAND
           He's heard enough. If we're going
           to launch, we need to keep them here
           until afterwards.
                         
                          COOPER
           You can't keep us here.
           33.
                         
                          BRAND
           He could endanger the mission.
                         
                          COOPER
           I'm not going to endanger it any
           more than you already have.
                         
          Cooper points to a telemetry unit that is being repaired by
          a robot on a nearby bench.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Are you using that for guidance?
                         
                          DOYLE
           Why not? We've tested it a hundred
           times.
                         
                          COOPER
           The power supply is no good. If the
           voltage fluctuates under load, the
           unit will fail.
                         
                          BRAND
           Now how could you possibly know that?
                         
                          COOPER

          Brand looks back at the telemetry system. The older engineer
          watches the exchange, thinking.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INT. MACHINE SHOP, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- DAY
                         
          Cooper and Murph have been locked in an abandoned machine
          shop, surrounded by the massive remains of rocket engines in
          various states of disrepair. Tars is blocking the door.
                         
          Cooper stands. Tars wags a long, hydraulic finger at him.
                         
                          COOPER
           You plan on keeping us here forever?
                         
                          TARS

           My battery has a duty cycle of five
           hundred years.
                         
          Cooper gives up. He turns back.
           34.
                         
          The back of the shop is filled with a group of older ROBOTS
          who are overhauling an engine. One problem -- the engine
          isn't there. Their programming hasn't been updated to reflect
          their obsolescence.
                         
          Murph watches, entranced, as the robots go about their
          business, efficiently TORQUING bolts with impact drivers
          into a non-existent thruster cone. The bolts CLATTER to the
          ground as the robots stop to reload.
                         
                          MURPH
           What are they doing, dad?
                         
                          COOPER
           I guess no one told them they were
           out of a job.
           (nods at Tars)
           Same as the rest of these people.
                         
          Cooper notices through the glass door of the lab that Brand
          and the older engineer are arguing about something. She
          finally relents and walks towards the door.
                         
          Brand walks in. She gestures for Cooper to follow.
                         
                          BRAND
           The mission commander wants to see
           you. Your son can stay here. He'll
           be all right with Tars.
                         
          Cooper eyes Tars warily. Then steps outside.
                         
          EXT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY
                         
          They walk across the space towards the base of the rocket,
          away from the other engineers. Cooper nods at the older
          engineer.
                         
                          COOPER

           The 'old man' is my father.
           And he was in charge. But he decided
           that we needed someone who could
           lead the mission for the foreseeable

           With the rifle, I mean.
                         
          Brand heads towards a group of large maintenance ROBOTS
          clustered at the base of the rocket. A smaller, human sized
          robot is staring at the rocket, giving them instructions.
                         
          The robot looks up. This is CASE, the leader of the mission.
          Originally an air force pararescue officer, every part of
          him, from his alloy chassis to his voice, was designed to

                          CASE
           Humans worry about things like rank
           and experience. I'm only concerned
           with whether someone would be useful.
                          (BEAT)
           I think you'd be useful, Mr. Cooper.
                         
          Cooper is stunned. This is the offer he's waited his whole
          life for. And it's come too late.
                         
                          COOPER
           No. I'm sorry.
                         
          Cooper is deeply conflicted. But he can't leave his boys
          behind.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           I can't help you. I have
           responsibilities. Things that, no
           offense, are more important than a
           scientific mission.

           I'm not a scientist, Mr. Cooper.
           And this is not a scientific mission.
           It's a rescue mission.
                         
          He rises and shakes Cooper's hand.

          They are standing in a sealed corridor in the middle of a
          massive underground greenhouse. Through the glass, Cooper
          can see an acre or so of corn plants.
                         
          Cooper looks at the plants. They're all badly wilting.

           In the last century strands were
           limited to one or two species. But
           this one targets everything.

           consuming our food than we are.
                         
          Cooper looks at the dying corn.

           Who's going to find it? The

           like you are reduced to scavenging
           just to get by.
                          (LOOKS AWAY)
           The earth has had enough of us. We
           have two, maybe three generations
           left. Then our time here is over.
                         
          Cooper turns back from the glass, anger growing.

                          BRAND
           What would be the point? So humanity
           could spend the last fifty years of
           its life fighting over the scraps?
           It's better that they don't know.
                         
          Cooper begins to argue, then stops. He knows enough history
          to know she's right. He looks at the withering crops.

          He looks back at Brand, who holds his eye for a beat, then
          turns back into the light of the underground facility.

           You get older, sometimes you just

           play out. Your life. Your kids'
           lives. The whole crazy story.

           Besides, I'll be here to look after

          covered with math. Cooper steps inside.
                         
          He notices a packed suitcase sitting by the door. The boy
          looks up, hopeful.
                         
                          MURPH
           I've been doing the math, dad. I

           to do here, too.
                         
          Tears are streaming down the boy's face. Cooper takes his
          watch off. Looks at it.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)

          Murph shakes his head, but the sadness remains. He knows
          this is goodbye, even if his father doesn't.

          Cooper turns and walks toward the bunker. The doors open
          and Tars and Doyle step out to greet him.

           We knew we'd need decades of parts
           and materials. The government was
           getting rid of some things. So we
           arranged to take some off their hands.
                         
          She cuts the engine and hooks the boat up to a buoy. She
          tosses a compact rebreather.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)

           You just breathe. Tap my arm or

           problem. And don't get lost.
                         
          She picks up her rebreather and begins looking over it.
                         
                          COOPER
           So you're a salvage diver now? I

           We're not going to have a lot of
           backup where we're going, Cooper.
           We all need expertise in at least
           three fields. Except for you, of

          With that she rolls backwards out of the boat and into the
          water.
                         
          Cooper hastily fits his rebreather and follows.

          Cooper sinks underwater and begins swimming after Brand, who
          is descending at a rapid clip.
                         
          She pulls out a flashlight and turns it on. A tiny beam
          picks out details at the bottom.
                         
          Cooper stops breathing.
                         
          The bottom of the ocean is covered with an entire fleet of
          the US navy. Nuclear subs. Battleships. Destroyers.
                         
          Cooper remembers to breath again. Then he hurries to catch
          up with Brand.

          Cooper holds the light as Brand efficiently disassembles a
          ballistic missile and removes the telemetry board.
                         
          She holds it up for Cooper. He nods. She swims on.

          Cooper, dripping wet, holding the telemetry board, struggles
          to keep pace with Brand through stacks of equipment and years
          of research and experimentation.

           You can set that down over there.
                         
          Cooper sets the board down. His eye is drawn to a bizarre
          experiment -- an ant colony built into a massive spinning
          centrifuge. Brand notices.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           We didn't know what kind of gravity
           to expect. We experimented with

           Why am I not surprised?
                         
          Cooper looks at the tiny colonies of ants struggling to go
          about their business in the raised gravity.
                         
                          COOPER
           Looks like hard work.
                         
                          BRAND
           It's a paradox. Life couldn't form
           without gravity. No stars. No
           planets. The component pieces would
           just drift apart. But too much of
           it and you're trapped.
                         
          Brand's guard relaxes a tiny bit as she talks about her work.
          The moment passes quickly, and she continues on into the
          stack of equipment.
                         
          INT. MISSION CONTROL, UNDERGROUND HANGAR -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper watches with the rest of the crew as Case pulls up
          the holographical maps for their journey.
                         
          Brand steps into the back of the room. Cooper notices her
          and nods. She ignores him.

          Case switches the map to a vista filled with stars and black
          holes.
                         
                          CASE (CONT'D)
           Based on our latest modelling we
           think the region on the far side of
           the wormhole is the center of a
           galaxy.
                         
          Case zooms in on the center of the hologram: an incredibly
          bright mass with plasma jets firing off in either direction.

           No. A black hole. There are several

           Don't worry about Roth. He's nuts.
           But Case says that means he's ideally
           suited for space travel.
                         
          Case repositions the map near a much smaller black hole that
          is orbiting Gargantua.

          Case draws a finger through the air, leaving a red trail.
          He traces the trajectory their ship will take.

           About the planet.

           The critical orbit here is incredibly

           I find it hard to believe that someone

           us to a dead end.
                         
                          DOYLE
           I thought you were a scientist, Brand.
           That sounds more like a hypothesis.
                         
                          BRAND
           A guess. That's right. We don't

           My guess is that the wormhole is
           there because someone is trying to
           help us. The same way we used to
           try to help animals when they were

           I guess I'm also assuming that whoever
           built the wormhole has a better plan
           than we did. If I'm wrong, we'll
           die, same as we'd die here anyway.

           If we're guessing, then I'd say
           Brand's right. The wormhole couldn't
           exist naturally. I think it's there
           for a reason. That someone is trying
           to help us.

          Tars turns his back to Cooper. Two flaps on the back of his
          torso slide open, revealing his control module.
                         
                          TARS (CONT'D)
           If you try to turn me into a combine
           harvester, I'm going to--
                         
          His voice cuts out as Cooper removes the chip and seals it
          in the briefcase.
                         
          Brand's Father resumes exploring the chaos of ones and zeroes
          on the probe's memory. Cooper watches.
                         
                          BRAND'S FATHER
           It's noise. I know it's noise. But
           it looks too orderly. Probably just
           an old man seeing things.
           50.
                         
          He shuts down the monitor.
                         
          INT. UNDERGROUND HANGAR -- DAY
                         
          The crew file into the capsule, wearing their bulky
          spacesuits.
                         
          Cooper watches as Brand's Father seals his daughter into her
          suit. He hugs her and she heads for the capsule.
                         
          INT. CONTROL CAPSULE, ROCKET -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper straps himself into a seat next to Brand. He catches
          her eye. She looks away -- she's crying.
                         
                          COOPER
           We'll be back.
                         
          It sounds like he's trying to reassure himself as much her.
                         
                          BRAND
           I won't.
                         
          Cooper looks at her, confused. As he does, the entire rocket
          SHAKES as the primary rockets begin to fire.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           If we find a habitable environment,
           I'm staying behind to build the
           colony.
                         
          Brand wipes her tears away and settles into the same fearless
          mask she usually wears. She steals one last look out the
          window at Earth, then looks back.
                         
          Cooper begins to say something, but stops as the entire rocket
          LURCHES as the primary engines FIRE.
                         
          EXT. SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- NIGHT
                         
          The desolate island is suddenly painted in color as the rocket
          lifts off on a massive white cloud.
                         
          EXT. FIELD -- DAY
                         
          Murph sits alone on a rise overlooking the massive co-op
          farms. Behind him the combines continue to work, oblivious.
                         
          Murph watches a tiny vapor trail as it races for the heavens.
          His father's watch dangles from his wrist.
                         
          INT. CAPSULE -- NIGHT
                         
          The interior of the capsule SHAKES with incredible violence
          as the rocket is lifted up on a giant, continuous explosion.
           51.
                         
          EXT. SPACE, NEAR EARTH ORBIT
                         
          The rocket sheds one stage, then another, until finally the
          naked capsule reaches the blackness of space and rockets on.
                         
          INT. CAPSULE
                         
          Cooper looks through the tiny porthole into inky blackness.
                         
          As they get closer, he makes out a looming matte black
          structure that passes light from the stars directly through.
                         
          In the center of the structure, Cooper can see a globe-like
          ship covered in the same refractive material: the ENDURANCE.
                         
          INT. SPACE STATION
                         
          The door cracks open and equalizes with a HISS. Case, more
          comfortable in the zero gravity environment than the humans,
          hauls himself through.
                         
          They are greeted by a group of robots painted in the same
          material as the ship -- the engineers who built and have
          maintained the Endurance for thirty years.
                         
          INT. MACHINE SHOP, SPACE STATION
                         
          One of the robots leads Cooper through a long lab-like room
          filled with machines capable of fabricating almost anything
          imaginable. Cooper looks like a kid in a candy store.
                         
          The robot reaches a vacuum-sealed package. Cuts it open,
          revealing a bipedal frame.
                         
          Cooper begins LAUGHING -- Tar's new body is beautifully
          designed, but tiny, only about four feet tall.
                         
                          ENGINEER ROBOT
           Would you like me to install the
           chip?
                         
                          COOPER
           Oh, no. I want to see this.
                         
          Cooper takes Tars's chip out of its plastic safety case and
          looks it over. The engineer opens a bay in the back of the
          frame and Cooper slides the chip inside.
                         
          The frame begins its "handshake" -- lights illuminate on the
          body, muscles flicker from a long gestation. The eyes open.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
                          (SMILES)
           Good morning, sunshine.
           52.
                         
          Tars takes one or two steps forward, rotating his arms --
          the robot equivalent of a stretch. Cooper can barely hide
          his mirth at Tars's newfound lack of stature.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Bit of a demotion.
                         
          Tars turns back toward Cooper. He puffs out his chest and
          suddenly his stubby arms and legs telescope, unfolding into
          long, svelte limbs. When he's done he stands eight feet
          tall, even more impressive than his earthbound frame.
                         
                          TARS
           I wouldn't call it that, exactly.
                         
          He reaches out an arm and pats Cooper on the shoulder.
                         
          INT. ENDURANCE, SPACE STATION
                         
          Cooper and the others haul themselves into the ship. To
          Cooper's surprise, it's quite compact, and divided into two
          chambers, like nestled spheres.
                         
                          COOPER
           The ship is tiny.
                         
          Doyle, squeezing past him, smiles at Cooper's surprise.
                         
                          DOYLE
           So is the wormhole.
                         
          Doyle pats Cooper on the back. Cooper begins hauling gear
          inside.
                         
          EXT. SPACE, NEAR EARTH ORBIT
                         
          In complete silence, the Endurance detaches from the space
          station and rolls gently away.
                         
          After a moment, its nuclear engines fire and the Endurance
          begins to accelerate steadily away from the Earth.
                         
          INT. SPACE STATION
                         
          The engineer robots who built the Endurance watch as their
          creation disappears into space.
                         
          Their mission is complete. One by one, they shut down.
                         
          INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE
                         
          The crew watch through a translucent section of the ship's
          hull as the Earth gets steadily smaller.
                         
          Then they settle in for the long journey to the wormhole.
           53.
                         
          INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE
                         
          Tars is hunched over a small communications relay, one hand
          is holding a paint brush -- he is making delicate strokes,
          painting the relay a bright blue.
                         
          Cooper watches him for a moment. Tars looks up.
                         
                          TARS
           It's the comms relay. It will allow
           us to talk to earth, even on the far
           side of the wormhole.
                         
                          COOPER
           I know. So why are you painting it?
                         
          Tars looks almost bashful.
                         
                          TARS
           It helps me calibrate my fine motor
           control.
                         
                          COOPER
           Sure it does.
                          (SMILES)
           You're pretty good.
                         
          Tars double checks his work.
                         
                          TARS
           I learned it during the war.
                         
                          COOPER
           What'd you paint?
                         
                          TARS
           Tombstones.
                         
          Cooper watches him finish in silence.
                         
          INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE
                         
          Cooper watches a highly-compressed video of his son, Tom,
          talking about school.
                         
                          TOM
           They said I can start an agriculture
           class a year early.
                         
          Cooper shakes his head.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           I've got to go, Dad. Hope you're
           safe up there.
           54.
                         
          Tom gets up to leave. Donald sits down in his place.
                         
                          DONALD
           I'm sorry, Coop. I asked Murph to
           record you a message but he's still...
           well, he's still angry with you.
           I'll try again next week.
                         
          The video cuts out. Cooper stares at the darkened screen.
                         
          INT. ENGINE ROOM, ENDURANCE
                         
          Cooper, Brand and Tars are moving the bundles of colonization
          equipment into bins along the wall of the craft.
                         
          Tars pulls a stack of equipment out the stack and stows it
          against the wall. Cooper copies the procedure.
                         
          They labor in silence, working their way along the hull.
          Cooper gets quicker with each bundle, keeping pace with Tars.
                         
                          TARS
           Be careful. It's difficult to gauge
           mass in zero gravity.
                         
                          COOPER
           How much do these things weigh?
                         
                          TARS
           Four tons.
                         
          Cooper looks at the incredibly heavy bundle spinning easily
          in his hands. He tries to stop it. Catches his hand.
                         
                          COOPER
           Damn.
                         
          He jerks his hand away, then pushes himself after the spinning
          bundle, trying to stop it before it can damage the hull.
          Tars helps him catch it inches from the hull wall.
                         
          Brand floats over to Cooper, smiling at him the whole time
          with an exaggerated grin.
                         
                          BRAND
           Smile.
                         
          Cooper smiles, taken aback by Brand's sudden friendliness.
                         
                          COOPER
           Why?
                         
                          BRAND
           Because it lowers your blood pressure.
           55.
                         
          Cooper looks at his hand. Blood is pouring out of his palm
          in large glistening bubbles.
                         
          INT. INFIRMARY, ENDURANCE
                         
          Cooper, slightly embarrassed, is seated while Case is hunched
          over his hand, sewing the meat of it back together with
          perfect little stitches.

           Fine. The anesthetic is working.
                         
                          CASE
           No -- I mean how is your mood? You

           perhaps Ms. Brand.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (EMBARRASSED)
           You worry about my hand and I'll
           worry about my mood.
                         
                          CASE
           Only five percent of my resources
           are devoted to human anatomy. Ten
           percent is the mission protocol.
           The rest is human psychology.
                         
                          COOPER
           Why?
                         
                          CASE
           We are floating in a total vacuum in
           a plastic ship powered by nuclear
           engines. But the most dangerous
           thing onboard is the three pounds of
           organic material in your skull.
                         
                          COOPER
           If we're such a liability, why take
           us along? You and Tars could build
           the colony without us. You wouldn't
           need to bring food or oxygen.
                         
                          CASE
           Because humans, despite your obvious
           physical shortcomings, are better at
           surviving than we are. Your

           Humans are good at surviving because
           evolution gave you magical thinking --
           the idea that your relationships
           mean something. You can't explain
           the feelings, so you think of them
           as irrational. But they're not.
           They're programming.

          Cooper looks away, overcome for a second with emotion. Case
          watches him, gauging his mood, whether he has said too much.

          Cooper stops recording. Looks at the equipment, thinking it
          over. Erases the message. Stands to leave.
                         
          As he steps to the door he notices Brand watching him through
          the window. She looks away.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE

           You never had any? I thought I was

          Cooper looks at the holographic model of the black hole
          system. The ice planet looks precariously balanced, orbiting
          the smaller black hole.

          EXT. LAGRANGE POINT, SPACE
                         
          Behind the ship, the sun is a distant light, not much bigger
          than the other stars.
                         
           CASE (O.S.)
           We've reached the wormhole.
                         
          The ship slows as it nears a tiny, crystal mouth, just four
          meters or so in diameter.

          The relay is released from the ship, and we finally get a
          look at Tars' paint job -- the stubby device looks like a
          20th century mail box.
                         
          The relay drifts in space. A signal light illuminates as it
          sends a test packet of data to the ship.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
                         
          Cooper watches the comms screen. After a moment it TONES as

          Cooper and the rest begin folding away equipment in the

          Case initiates a sequence on the keypad and the nuclear

          EXT. ENDURANCE, SPACE
                         
          The nuclear engines drift a safe distance back from the ship

          INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE
                         
          The crew move into the tight, claustrophobic outer layer of
          the ship. They will have very little room as the ship passes
          through the wormhole.
                         
          Tars detaches his legs in order to take up less space during
          transit. Then he tethers himself to the hull wall.
                         
          Case is the last to join them. He detaches a small control
          module from the console, then pulls himself into the outer
          hull and seals the passageway.
                         
          Case presses a button on the control module. With a GROAN,
          the hull walls of the ship begin to BEND.
                         
          EXT. ENDURANCE, SPACE
                         
          The ship's hull begins to CRACK open, revealing the inner

          The ship silently rolls itself into position, pointing the
          opening in its hull toward the wormhole mouth.
                         
          Slowly, the Endurance pushes itself forward, closer and closer
          to the crystal-like mouth. Finally, it envelops the mouth,
          bringing it into the open chamber.
                         
          INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE

          center of the inner compartment.
                         
          Case presses a sequence key on the control panel and the
          ship's hull closes again, trapping the wormhole inside it.
                         
          With a GRUMBLE, the ship begins contracting, squeezing itself
          down around the wormhole mouth.
                         
          Cooper takes a deep breath as the center of the ship begins
          gently lowering itself into the wormhole mouth, feeding itself
          into the wormhole from the inside out. Cooper watches as
          Doyle is swallowed into the compressing ship with a GRUNT.

          The Endurance shrinks as it sinks from the inside out into
          the wormhole.
                         
          After a moment, it's gone. The only thing left behind is
          the comms relay, drifting in space, waiting for a signal.

          The ship continues to slide through the wormhole. Through
          the outer hull they see images of themselves repeating -- a
          trick of the narrow collar of space they are sinking through.
          Cooper smiles at himself. The experience is unnerving.

           The hull is intact. Thirty more
           seconds transit.
                         
          For a moment, the ship slides gently, silently, through the
          wormhole. The quiet is eery.
                         
          Suddenly, a point of distortion appears in the hull next to
          Cooper. It looks like someone is pushing against the hull
          of the ship with a giant finger.
                         
                          COOPER
           Something's happening to the hull

                          COOPER
           Well, I don't know what your display
           is telling you but something is
           happening over here.
                         
          Suddenly, along the hull, Doyle speaks up, panicked.
                         
                          DOYLE
           I've got a problem over here, too.
                         
          Doyle is watching a separate distortion move across the inner
          wall of the ship. This one seems to be TWISTING the material
          of the hull.
                         
          Suddenly, the point in front of Cooper detaches itself from
          the outer wall and moves through the space in front of him,
          bending the empty space itself, distorting the ship behind
          it like a sphere-shaped magnifying glass.
                         
                          DOYLE (CONT'D)

          Roth watches as the distortions move through the ship. His
          curiosity doesn't make anyone else feel any better.

           gravitational turbulence.
                         
          The twisting sphere in front of Doyle begins to grow.
                         
                          DOYLE
           It's getting bigger.
                         
          Doyle puts up his hand to defend himself. The sphere absorbs
          it, twisting Doyle's hand. Doyle CRIES OUT.
                         
          His hand is twisted completely around, impossibly mangled.
          But Doyle, hyperventilating, isn't in any pain.
                         
                          ROTH
           It's not bending your hand. It's
           bending the space around your hand.
                         
          The sphere begins to pass through Doyle's body. Doyle is
          freaking out.
                         
          The sphere in front of Cooper makes contact with him, also.
          He holds his breath as it touches him, squeezing and
          distorting his body.
                         
                          BRAND
           This isn't turbulence. Look at the

           something's examining us.
                         
          Cooper watches the sphere distort his arm, running along the
          length of it.
                         
                          COOPER
           Can you ask it to stop?
                         
          Suddenly, as quickly as they appeared, the distortions vanish.
          For a moment, the crew is silent, still spellbound by the
          encounter.
                         
          An ALARM sounds. Suddenly, the inner chamber begins to
          distort from a spherical shape to bispherical: two spheres
          joined. The ship GROANS as if it's being pulled apart.
                         
                          ROTH
           The wormhole is splitting into two

          Doyle reaches over to an auxiliary panel and punches in a
          sequence.
                         
          After a moment, the hull cracks open, creating a channel
          through which the radiating mouth can escape.
                         
          The opening in the ship allows the pressure to begin to
          concentrate on one fracture point. The ship SHUDDERS as
          it's squeezed along its axis.
                         
          Case punches in a code and the ship begins to close again,
          painstakingly slowly. Finally, the ship calms as it closes
          around the original wormhole.

          Suddenly, the wormhole mouth begins to grow inside the inner
          chamber. What was a ball of light spreads out into a black
          canvas studded with points of light -- like looking into the
          universe through the wrong end of a telescope.
                         
          Cooper presses himself against the wall and holds on as the

          holes, some adorned with jets and brilliant gas disks.
                         
          At the center, like a king at the center of his court, is
          Gargantua, plasma jets spewing from its poles.

          The crew pull themselves back into the control deck from the

          Roth begins adapting his models of the local system with the
          real observational data pouring in from the ship's
          instruments.
                         
          Cooper pulls himself to the comms post. PINGS the relay

          Tars finishes reeling the nuclear engines back in from their

          Roth's updated model appears on the monitors. Brand stares

          The crew looks out through the hull. They are being pulled
          into Pantagruel's swirl -- a glittering disc of matter
          spinning at high speed around the hole.

          The ship accelerates as it is pulled by the irresistible
          force of the black hole onto an inspiraling orbit.

          higher and higher speeds.
                         
          The sky overhead begins to spin due to their motion -- faster
          and faster until it becomes a blur. The ship begins to GROAN
          as it appears to be pulled in two different directions.
                         
          The ship is now speeding around the black hole at incredible
          speed -- one revolution every four seconds. The crew are
          suddenly SLAMMED against the hull in opposite directions --
          some towards the black hole, some towards the opposite side.
                         
          Roth looks at his model, which shows the projected path of
          the ship. It looks perilously close to the event horizon.

          The comms screen lights up, TONING again and again, as it
          receives a long garbled update. Then it shuts down. Cooper

          As the crew watches, Tars continues to hold the engine even
          as the casing around it begins to melt. Finally, it EXPLODES.

          On Roth's model, the course slowly pushes outward, out of

          Brand and Case are having a private conversation away from

          The space below it is choked with hundreds of tiny moons --
          a cruder version of Saturn's rings. The moons are hurtling

          The moons are vastly different than our own; potato shaped
          and only one to two miles in circumference, they are hugged
          in a close embrace with the ice planet, only a few hundred
          thousand feet from the surface.

           in the ice.
                         
          Case leads the way, drawn by a signal only he can hear. He
          walks fifty yards, then stops on a gentle slope that leads

          Case and the others begin digging into the hillside. Cooper
          is drawn to a small mound in the middle of the valley, four
          feet high. He takes out a small folding shovel and begins
          scraping at the ice and snow.
                         
          Case hits something solid. But it's not a probe. He digs
          around a little more, then reaches up and hacks away at the
          hillside, revealing the outline of something metal:
                         
          A door. They're not standing at the base of a hill -- it's
          a shelter. The crew stands back, unsure what to make of it.
                         
          A few feet away, Cooper cuts enough of the mound away to
          reveal something flexible -- fabric caked with ice. He
          scrapes away the snow, revealing a bright patch of red fabric:
                         
          It's the flag of the People's Republic of China.

          Case steps up to an equipment locker. Forces it open. Inside
          are half a dozen black probes. Exposed to light, the probes

          trips over something, dropping the equipment.
                         
          Cooper looks back. He tripped on a white plastic post
          sticking out of the snow. He dusts it off, to reveal a
          picture of a Chinese Taikonaut smiling in his flight suit.
          This is a grave marker.
                         
          Cooper sweeps his hand through the snow, revealing three
          more white posts with pictures. The entire human crew has
          been buried here.
                         
          INT. UTILITY MODULE, CHINESE BASE CAMP -- NIGHT
                         
          Roth and Case are looking at a portable monitor, showing a
          projection of the nearby system -- the ice planet is a speck
          orbiting the local black hole.
                         
                          COOPER
           The entire human crew is buried out
           there in the snow.
           75.
                         
          Roth looks up from the monitor and assesses the situation
          with his usual detachment.
                         
                          ROTH
           I think I know what killed them.
           This planet isn't the only thing
           orbiting this black hole.
                         
          Roth zooms the monitor in, revealing a tiny, impossibly-bright
          object appearing at the horizon of the black hole.
                         
                          ROTH (CONT'D)
           It's a neutron star. The black hole
           shields the planet's surface from it
           for twenty hours at a stretch. Time's
           about up.
                         
          Even Brand looks rattled.
                         
                          BRAND
           How long do we have left?
                         
                          ROTH
           About five minutes.
                         
                          COOPER
           Then what?
                         
                          BRAND
           Then we die. The radiation will
           cook us alive.
                         
          Cooper looks around, their predicament settling in. Case
          walks over to the edge of the mine shaft.
                         
                          CASE
           We have to go down.
                         
                          COOPER
           What about returning to the ship?
                         
                          BRAND
           Not enough time. Case is right.
           The ice can shield us from some of
           the x-rays.
                         
                          DOYLE
           It would take a thousand feet of ice
           to shield us.
                         
          Brand gives up on the argument, sheds her equipment and clips
          herself to the line to follow Case down into the ice.
                         
          Cooper looks at Doyle, then follows her.
           76.
                         
          INT. ICE MINE SHAFT -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper descends into the shaft. The only light is from his
          suit's light array.
                         
          He reaches the bottom of the shaft, which opens into a small
          cave, the ice ribbed in wave-like patterns like the seafloor.
                         
                          COOPER
           What is this?
                         
                          BRAND
           A pocket formed by gas. There may
           be more below.
                         
          The ice below them reveals nothing but murky blackness.
          Case has found some of the equipment left behind by the
          Chinese -- a battery-powered drill and a pick.
                         
                          DOYLE
           We'll never make it far enough down.
                         
                          BRAND
           Shut up. How much time do we have,
           Roth?
                         
          Roth checks his watch with his usual detachment.
                         
                          ROTH
           About three minutes or so until we're
           fully exposed.
                         
          The rad meter Brand is holding begins to CHIRP with activity --
          the radiation levels are rising. The ice will not be enough
          to protect them.
                         
          Cooper sees that Brand has exhausted herself with the pick.
          He takes over for her.
                         
          The drill that Case is operating GROANS as the thirty-year-
          old battery runs out of charge. Case casts it aside and
          begins SMASHING at the ice with his bare hand.
                         
          Brand is looking at the walls of the ice pocket, looking for
          fissures. Her lights pick out something in the ice. She
                         LOOKS CLOSER:
                         
          Tiny black flecks. Brand, ever the scientist, forgets their
          predicament and begins chipping at the ice.
                         
                          BRAND
           I've found something.
                         
          Case continues to pummel the ice with his hand, which is
          badly smashed.
           77.
                         
          He pulls off the hand and continues to hack away at the ice
          with the stump, trying to save his crew.
                         
          Brand is examining a piece of ice in her hands, which contains
          several black flecks. As she shines her light on them, they
          FLUORESCE, giving off a tiny flicker of light, like a firefly.
          Brand steps back.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           These things... they're alive.
                         
          Roth joins her, looking down at the tiny creatures trapped
          in the ice. Brand shines her flashlight over the ice again,
          but nothing happens. Roth takes the depth meter dangling by
          a lanyard from Brand's suit.
                         
                          ROTH
           It's not your light they're responding
           to. It's this--
                         
          Roth takes the depth meter and waves it over the ice.
          Suddenly, the black flecks begin to shine.
                         
                          BRAND
           X-rays. They feed on them and emit
           visible light. They've found a way
           to survive here.
                         
          Roth looks at the shimmering light of the tiny life-forms
          trapped in the ice, mesmerized.
                         
          Case hammers down with his arm, gouging a deep hole in the
          ice below. Suddenly, GAS sprays back up at him. He's found
          the gas pocket beneath them.
                         
          Too late. Roth's rad meter begins BEEPING frantically.
                         
          EXT. ICE PLANET -- ALIEN DAWN
                         
          Overhead, a tiny ball is orbiting into view from the dark
          side of the black hole -- the NEUTRON STAR.
                         
          Its humble size belies its power. As its rays hit the ice,
          the ice CRACKLES with energy.
                         
          INT. ICE MINE SHAFT -- ALIEN DAWN
                         
          Brand steps back from the ice in awe as it begins to glow.
          The microbes are absorbing the x-rays and emitting light.
          Within seconds, they are bathed in an incredible glow.
                         
          Even Cooper stops, awed by the beauty of the display. Only
          Case is unmoved, continuing to SMASH at the ice with the
          broken end of his wrist.
           78.
                         
                          BRAND
           (looks at rad meter)
           They're absorbing most of the x-rays.
                         
                          ROTH
           Not enough, unfortunately.
                         
          Suddenly, a CRACK as Case punches into the ice. Cooper looks
          down -- a great fissure has opened in the ice beneath them.
                         
                          COOPER
           Case, wait--
                         
          Case PUNCHES again. Suddenly, with a great BANG, the ice
          floor disintegrates beneath them.
                         
          They fall into the darkness.
                         
          INT. CAVERN -- ALIEN DAWN
                         
          Cooper falls. For a moment, the only light he can see is
          from Case, falling calmly a few yards beneath him.
                         
          As they fall, the light from the microbes trapped in the ice
          above sweeps across the inside of the cavern, illuminating
          the floor of the massive cavern thousands of feet down.
                         
          The rock formations they saw on the surface are actually the
          tip of a mountain range extending into the distance,
          disappearing into the ice above as if it were cloud cover.
                         
          The base of the mountains is covered in a thick jungle-like
          foliage that runs into a perfectly-still inland sea. On the
          far side of the sea, another mountain range stretches into
          the distance, supporting the thick ice and rock cavern roof.
                         
          Cooper only has a few seconds to take this in -- he is falling
          towards the huge inland sea below.
                         
          Seconds before impact, a tiny warning light flickers on inside
          his helmet: IMPACT DETECTED.
                         
          Suddenly, a small drag chute EXPLODES from a panel on the
          back of suit, slowing his fall. Airbags EXPLODE on his legs
          and torso to cushion the impact.
                         
          Cooper SMASHES into the water.
                         
          BLACKNESS.
                         
          EXT. UNDERWATER -- DAY
                         
          Cooper comes to underwater, as liquid is flowing into his
          suit from his shattered helmet.
           79.
                         
          Bubbles pour out from his suit and Cooper GASPS as his helmet
          fills with water and he begins to sink.
                         
          As he sinks, Cooper pulls off his helmet, then tears off
          pieces of his suit. He forces himself through the neck of
          the suit and then swims upward.
                         
          He is about to surface when he remembers where he is. He
          hesitates, just beneath the surface, lungs tightening as he
          runs out of oxygen.
                         
          EXT. SEA, ICE PLANET -- DAY
                         
          Cooper breaks the surface, COUGHS out water, and takes a
          panicked breath.
                         
          He waits. Nothing happens. He opens his mouth again and
          breathes in almost pure oxygen. He can breathe.
                         
          Treading water, he looks around. Spots lights in the water
          below nearby -- Brand, in her suit, is sinking.
                         
          He dives down and struggles to haul her up by the suit.
                         
          Cooper breaks the surface, looks at Brand. Her mask is also
          broken.
                         
                          COOPER
           Breathe. Trust me.
                         
          She refuses at first. Water is bubbling into her suit through
          the open mask. Finally, she takes a deep breath.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Your suit is filling with water.
           I'm not going to be able to hold it
           much longer. I'm going to let go.
                         
          Brand's eyes widen.
                         
                          BRAND
           What do you mean, you're going to
           let go?
                         
                          COOPER
           Take a deep breath.
                         
          Brand takes a deep breath and Cooper lets go of her.
                         
          EXT. UNDERWATER -- DAY
                         
          Brand sinks. Cooper swims down, following her, ripping away
          at her suit. The tear-away seals on her suit are stuck fast,
          damaged in the fall.
           80.
                         
          Cooper finally breaks them off. Brand pulls herself out,
          free, and they swim for the surface.
                         
          EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- DAY
                         
          Cooper drags himself out of the water and onto the beach.
          He turns back to offer Brand a hand. She waves him off.
                         
                          BRAND
           I don't need your help.
                         
                          COOPER
           I thought we were supposed to be a
           collective organism.
                         
          She gives up and lets him help her out of the water.
                         
          They sit together, soaking wet, trying to catch their breath.
                         
                          BRAND
           Thank you.
                         
                          COOPER
           Don't mention it.
                         
          Cooper feels the rocks beneath him, which are translucent,
          like glass, and polished to an impossible shine.
                         
          He looks up to see Case dragging Roth and Doyle, still in
          their suits, out of the water.
                         
          EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- DAY

          breathing in the pure oxygen atmosphere.
                         
          Case and Cooper are pulling modular pieces from their

                          (TO COOPER)
           You still think this is a coincidence?
                         
          Cooper looks at the tree line, less convinced.
                         
                          COOPER
           Looks like we can climb up the
           mountains back to the ice. We're
           down to three suits. We'll have to
           send someone ahead to get a fourth.
           81.
                         
                          BRAND
           I won't need one.
                         
                          DOYLE
           Why not?
                         
                          BRAND
           Because I'm not going anywhere.
           This is our new home.
                         
          Brand picks up some of her instruments and a sample case and
          hikes into the jungle.
                         
          EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- DAY
                         
          Cooper finishes constructing the modest shelter. They load
          the suits and the rest of their gear inside.
                         
                          COOPER
           Any sign of Brand?
                         
                          ROTH
           She's still taking samples. If you
           find her, tell her to head back.
           Night should be falling soon.
                         
                          COOPER
           What happens then?
                         
                          ROTH
           Your guess is as good as mine.
                         
          Cooper hikes into the jungle to look for Brand.
                         
          EXT. JUNGLE, ICE PLANET -- DAY
                         
          Cooper finds Brand taking samples from the tree-like life-
          forms, which are wildly different from their counterparts
          back on Earth, piled in torturous coils, as if frozen in a
          struggle to punch through the canopy to reach the light above.
                         
                          BRAND
           This is incredible. The organisms
           trapped in the ice above absorb x-
           rays and emit light. In return,
           these plants absorb the light and
           emit oxygen, which feeds the animals
           trapped in the ice.
                         
          Brand cuts off a sample and drops it into the case. The
          transparent wall of the case magnifies the structure onto
          the glass automatically. She compares it with the flecks
          she collected in the ice above, fascinated.
           82.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           Look at this. I think they're the
           same organism at a different stage
           of the life cycle.
           (shows him the sample)
           It's fractal. No individual cells --
           the structure repeats all the way
           down.
                         
          Cooper looks at the sample, then continues scanning the jungle
          around them, nervous.
                         
                          COOPER
           Any sign of big life-forms?
                         
                          BRAND
           The soil's been disturbed. So
           something's been moving. But I
           haven't seen anything.
           (notices his look)
           Cooper... are you nervous?
                         
          Cooper stops scanning the trees, embarrassed.
                         
                          COOPER
           I just think we should get back to
           the shelter before night falls.
                         
          Overhead, the light from the ice above begins to fade -- the
          neutron star must have orbited out of view. Night is falling.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (LAUGHING)
           Relax. If there are any large
           organisms here, even predatory ones,
           they're not going to attack us --
           they have no idea what we are.
                         
                          COOPER
           You don't know that. You just have
           blind faith this place is going to
           be some kind of Eden.
                         
          Brand stops. He's struck a nerve.
                         
                          BRAND
           (truly pissed off)
           Faith has nothing to do with it.
           You know what you are, Cooper? You're
           just another in a long line of people
           saying 'no.' That this isn't going
           to work. And frankly, I don't have
           to convince you.
           83.
                         
                          COOPER
           What's that supposed to mean?
                         
                          BRAND
           You're on this mission because you're
           another pair of hands. You want the
           truth? I told Case we should bring
           another robot over you. At least
           then I could just reprogram you to-
                         
          She stops. Something has caught her attention.
                         
                          COOPER
           What?
                         
                          BRAND
           Nothing. I just -- I could have
           sworn it just moved.
                         
          She walks to the thick, knotted trunk of a tree. Puts a
          hand on it.
                         
          Overhead, the ice flickers out and the darkness begins to
          descend, more rapidly than on Earth.
                         
          Suddenly, the tree SHUDDERS. Then, the bark begins to ooze
          over Brand's fingers.
                         
          Brand snaps her hand away and steps back. Even for her,
          this is too much. She turns back to Cooper, who is looking
          at the jungle around them, spooked.
                         
                          COOPER
           You know how plants don't usually
           move? Is that a universal rule?
                         
                          BRAND
           No. There really aren't any rules.
                         
          All around them, the life-forms begins to melt toward the
          ground, breaking down into different, smaller forms.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           (trying to stay calm)
           Remember, we're the aliens.
                         
          Cooper steps back as several pieces of the nearest tree drop
          onto the ground and begin scuttling toward him.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           Hold very still. Don't make any
           sudden movements.
                         
          Two of the pieces join together, stacking themselves up and
          staggering toward him.
           84.
                         
          A third piece climbs onto the first two, looking for a good
          place to hang on. After a moment it hunkers down on top,
          forming a crude head. Thirty eye-like structures blink open
          on the creature.
                         
          The skin of the life-form begins to flicker with a dim light
          like the animals trapped in the ice above, bathing Cooper
          and Brand in a warm glow.
                         
          The creature creeps closer to them, taking them in. Cooper
          tries his best to seem non-threatening.
                         
                          COOPER
           Hello there.
                         
          The creature lurches toward him on three legs, then its head
          splits open and it BELLOWS.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           OK. Now we run.
                         
          Brand doesn't argue. They turn and sprint through the trees.
                         
          EXT. JUNGLE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper and Brand smash headlong through the jungle. At first,
          they're running from the rumbling, smashing melee behind
          them. But as they run, the entire jungle around them begins
          to break apart and move.
                         
          After a moment, they're surrounded. The jungle is completely
          disassembling itself into a million different pieces, each
          one a different size and shape than the others.
                         
                          COOPER
           We have to reach the shelter.
                         
          They head off, crashing through the melee.
                         
          EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Case, Doyle and Roth are standing in front of the shelter
          finishing the day's work.
                         
          Doyle turns around. The jungle is breaking apart and crawling
          down the beach towards them.
                         
                          DOYLE
           I think we've got a problem.
                         
          Case and Roth look up to see the organisms picking up speed
          as they move towards them.
                         
          Roth begins to step out towards them.
           85.
                         
                          ROTH
           Fascinating. I think-
                         
          Case grabs him by the arm and pushes him bodily into the
          shelter after Doyle.
                         
          Case pushes the door closed.
                         
          INT. SHELTER, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          They crouch inside the shelter as the organisms begin POUNDING
          at the walls, trying to force their way inside.
                         
          It's going to be a long night.
                         
          EXT. JUNGLE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Ahead, Cooper can see the gleaming water of the inland sea,
          light still flickering in patches from the ice above it.
                         
                          COOPER
           This way.
                         
          Brand begins to follow.
                         
                          BRAND
           No... wait.
                         
          Too late. Cooper forces his way between two writhing
          creatures, steps through, and falls...
                         
          EXT. WATERFALL -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper gasps as he surfaces from the ice-cold water. Brand
          floats past.
                         
          The river appears to flow randomly down the slope, with good
          reason -- the forest rearranges itself every night.
                         
          Ahead, the ground drops away again and the water rushes over
          it in a torrent.
                         
          Cooper catches himself at the last minute, grabbing a thick
          tree branch with one hand and, a second later, Brand with
          the other as she slides past.
                         
                          COOPER
           I've got you.
                         
          Suddenly, the branch in Cooper's hand illuminates and wrenches
          itself out of the rock -- it's a limb of a huge colony
          organism. It shakes Cooper loose and they fall again...
           86.
                         
          EXT. POOL -- NIGHT
                         
          Brand surfaces first. She grabs Cooper and hauls him up and
          out of the water. She smiles down at him, a little smug.
                         
                          BRAND
           I've got you.
                         
          Creatures begin splashing down into the pool behind them, as
          if imitating them.
                         
          Cooper stumbles to his feet and Brand guides them backward
          into a small cave carved into the rock above the pool.
                         
          INT. CAVE -- NIGHT
                         
          Brand CRACKS a glow stick, basking the cave around them in a
          soft light.
                         
          As they watch, horrified, the pool and the rocks in front of
          the cave fill up with creatures of all sizes, as they tumble
          down the hill in what appears to be a battle royal.
                         
          For a moment, it looks like Brand and Cooper may go unnoticed.
          Then, a three-foot-tall creature with a dozen legs creeps
          its way toward the entrance to the cave. Another follows,
          and another, until the cave entrance is full.
                         
          Cooper looks around the cave, frantic. He picks up a rock.
          Brand, scared but still thinking, takes the rock from his
          hand and drops it back to the ground.
                         
                          BRAND
           It's game theory. The best move is
           always to cooperate at first.
                         
                          COOPER
           By "cooperate" do you mean let it
           eat me?
                         
                          BRAND
           These organisms have no interest in
           us. They survive by photosynthesis.
           All they need is light.
                         
                          COOPER
           Then why are they killing each other?
                         
                          BRAND
           I don't know.
                          (LOOKS AROUND)
           But we're outnumbered, Cooper. So
           unless you have a better idea, I
           suggest we make nice.
           87.
                         
          The creatures move toward them hesitantly, then faster.
                         
          Cooper stands stock still as the creatures gather around
          him. Several of them join up into bigger animals to get a
          better look at him.
                         
          One of them wraps itself around his chest and begins prodding
          at his shoulders, then his neck.
                         
                          COOPER
           (trying to be calm)
           What is it doing?
                         
                          BRAND
           It's a colony organism. It's trying
           to incorporate you into its structure.
                         
                          COOPER
           I don't want it to incorporate me.
                         
                          BRAND
           Don't open your mouth.
                         
                          COOPER
                          WHY N-
                         
          As he speaks, the creature on his chest extends four spindly,
          pointed feelers and reaches gently into his mouth.
                         
          Cooper holds his breath as the organism taps against his
          teeth. Its skin has a roughened texture, as if incomplete,
          and it appears to be searching for the same texture on
          Cooper's skin, without much luck.
                         
          Bored, the life-forms climb back down off of Cooper. The
          last two creatures link up in an imitation of Cooper's lower
          body and attempt to walk across the room like a human. After
          a moment, the creatures tumble to the ground and flail away.
                         
          Cooper is still breathing hard as the cave empties and he
          and Brand are left alone again.
                         
          Brand steps to the edge of the cave and watches, fascinated,
          as the creatures resume wrestling and battling each other.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           They're killing each other.
                         
                          BRAND
           No. They don't bleed... they don't
           die... they're just competing...
           trying out different shapes, looking
           for the best one.
           88.
                         
          Cooper watches as a hideously-awkward-looking, five-legged
          beast stumbles past and tackles another animal.
                         
                          COOPER
           I'd say they have a long way to go.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (AMAZED)
           They do this every night.
                         
          As they watch, a two-foot-long creature with one huge claw
          scuttles along the ground, grabbing smaller opponents and
          smashing them apart, then sorting through the wreckage and
          adopting some of the writhing parts as its own.
                         
          Something about the movement is endearing, the way it
          experiments with each piece -- less like a massacre and more
          like an over-caffeinated self-assembling erector set.
                         
          Suddenly, a massive, lumbering creature SMASHES down in front
          of the claw beast. No match, the smaller creature turns to
          scuttle away. Too slow. The larger organism brings one
          club-like limb smashing down on top of it. After a moment,
          it lifts its claw -- the two animals have become one.
                         
          The new organism lumbers away through the jungle, happily
          snapping its new claw at larger opponents.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           The behavior changes as the animals
           get bigger and bigger. More
           sophisticated. More calculated.
                         
          Two of the larger organisms square off, circling each other,
          lights pulsing up and down their bodies in a fierce display.
                         
                          COOPER
           But what are they competing for?
                         
                          BRAND
           I don't know.
                         
          Brand shivers -- it's getting colder.
                         
          INT. CAVE -- NIGHT
                         
          Brand and Cooper huddle around a small chemical fire they've
          brought with them.
                         
          Brand looks at the sample of the fractal wildlife in her
          case. It's moving around, splitting apart, reforming, trying
          to find a way out.
           89.
                         
                          BRAND
           These creatures are billions of years
           older than we are. But they're
           relatively primitive. They haven't
           developed tools, culture, language.
                         
                          COOPER
           Why not?
                         
                          BRAND
           I don't know. No one knows how
           intelligent life began on Earth.
           But the surface of this planet has
           virtually no craters. No impacts.
           It's been sheltered by the local
           black holes.
                         
                          COOPER
           What difference would that make?
                         
                          BRAND
           Maybe not enough has gone wrong here.
           Maybe bad luck is the key to
           intelligent life.

                          BRAND
           Exactly. Maybe our interaction with
           them will push them over the top.
           Maybe that's part of the plan.
                         
                          COOPER
           (shakes his head)
           The plan.
                         
                          BRAND
           Why is it so hard for you to accept
           that someone might be trying to help
           us?
                         
          Cooper is silent for a moment. His mood darkens.
                         
                          COOPER
           I was in Denver during the first
           year of the famine. I was just a
           kid. We kept waiting for someone to
           come help us. People starved to
           death sitting on the ground, waiting
           for someone to come.

                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           (looks at her)
           I only made it because I realized
           that nobody was coming to save us.
           We were on our own.
                         
          Cooper looks away. The memories are never that far away.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Honestly? After the things I saw...
           you want to know why I don't believe
           that someone would be trying to help
           us? Because I'm not sure we're worth
           saving.
                         
          They sit in silence for a while.
                         
          EXT. CAVE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper sleeps. After a moment, Brand steps back out into
          the darkness.
                         
          EXT. PLAIN -- DAWN
                         
          Brand exhales great streams of frosted breath -- the
          temperature is well below freezing. The first flickers of
          light are visible in the ice above.
                         
          The creatures are huge now, forty or fifty feet tall, battling
          each other more and more slowly. As Brand watches, the
          largest of them beats down his rivals, climbing to the top
          of the heap.
                         
          Just as the beast reaches the top, it freezes, as if stuck.
                         
          Above, the ice begins to shine brighter and brighter.
                         
          Suddenly, the beast on top breaks apart, unfurling into planes
          to catch the light. This is what the contest has been about --
          a better place in the sun.
                         
          Brand takes it in.
                         
          EXT. JUNGLE -- DAY
                         
          Cooper and Brand pick their way their way through the foliage,
          which is now perfectly still, absorbing the light. Cooper
          looks at the plants, wary.
                         
          Brand sees his trepidation and laughs at him.
                         
                          BRAND
           They're not going to move now, Cooper.
           They need to spread themselves as
           thin as they can to absorb the light.
           91.
                         
          Cooper leads the way, pushing through the trees.
                         
          Suddenly he stops again. Brand, annoyed, pushes through the
          foliage to join him.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           Cooper, honestly, you're a bit of a-
                         
          She stops. Cooper is standing at a sheer cliff.
                         
          Spread out on the plain below is a massive, fortified base.
                         
          INT. CHINESE FORTIFIED COLONY -- DAY
                         
          Massive blast doors, long since smashed in, open onto a
          building that has been overrun by the local fractal wildlife.
                         
          Case steps inside first, his worklights flickering on. Cooper
          and the others follow him in.
                         
          INT. MESS HALL, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
                         
          The room is barely recognizable -- the fractal life has
          covered the tables and chairs. Water pools on the floor and
          light streams in from a massive hole the fractal animals
          have punched in the ceiling.
                         
                          DOYLE
           Looks like the Chinese picked a fight
           with the locals.
                         
                          COOPER
           Looks like they lost.
                         
          They continue through the ruins.
                         
          INT. BARRACKS, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
                         
          The deeper they go, the less fractal wildlife they find.
          The barracks are pristine -- hundreds of perfectly made beds,
          waiting for colonists who never came, like one of the bunkers
          the federal government used to keep in case of nuclear winter.

           The Chinese government collapsed,

          Roth finds a sign he likes the look of -- it points to the

          INT. DAMAGED LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
                         
          Cooper and the others carefully make their way through a lab
          that has been completely emptied -- no desks, no chairs,
          nothing. The only thing that remains is a solid ball of
          matter in the center of the room.
                         
                          BRAND
           What happened here?

                          ROTH
           They were testing something.
                         
          Cooper looks at the walls, which are bowed inwards.
                         
                          COOPER
           Testing what?
                         
          Roth is looking at the ball, which appears to have been built
          from layers of different material. The outermost layer is
          flattened steel.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)

           Is that a chair?
                         
          Roth looks. The outermost layer of the ball indeed looks
          like a steel chair, flattened with incredible force onto
          surface of the ball.

          INT. LABORATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT
                         
          The lab is empty, except for a large metal sphere on a
          pedestal in the center of the room. A black box is set into
          a cavity in the sphere, wired to a control panel.
                         
          Cooper looks at the walls of the room, which have been bowed
          inwards, as if some great force had been pulling from the
          center of the room.

          Roth finds a control panel. Wipes off an inch of dust and
          begins tinkering with the controls.
                         
                          COOPER
           I wouldn't turn it on until we can
           figure out what it does, Roth.
                         
          Roth continues to look over the controls, oblivious.
                         
           BRAND (O.S.)
           Cooper. Come look at this.
                         
          Brand calls out from the hallway.
                         
          INT. STAIRWELL, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
                         
          Cooper follows Brand's voice down the stairs to a sub-basement
          beneath the lab level.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY
                         
          Cooper steps into a huge space filled with a near perfect
          holographic representation of the local system.
                         
          Cooper joins Brand and Doyle in the map, looking at the
          incredibly detailed models of each star.
                         
          Case is standing at a terminal, hacking into the camp's
          records.
                         
                          CASE
           I've found the Chinese mission logs.
           They're encrypted.
                         
          Cooper walks over. Looks over the terminal.
           94.
                         
                          COOPER
           Old military-grade encryption. It's
           not very robust.
           (looks at Case)
           No offense. Hang on.
                         
          Cooper punches a few keys into the terminal. Opens up the
          terminal. Scans the motherboard. Takes Case's rifle and
          SMASHES one of the chips on the board.
                         
          The terminal comes to life. Cooper hands Case his rifle.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           That should open up most of it.
                         
          Case is silent for a beat, parsing the information.
                         
                          CASE
           They got here twenty years ago. The
           human crew was killed by radiation
           the first day. But the robots
           survived. They built the colony and
           radioed home. But they didn't receive
           a response.
                         
                          COOPER
           No one was listening.

                          (SCANS DOCUMENT)
           After a few years they discovered a

                          DOYLE
           What problem?
                         
                          CASE
           It doesn't say. Their science team
           took the ship to continue exploring
           the system. It says they found some
           kind of...

           ...The word literally means
           'treasure.'
                         
          Case skims through the rest of the logs, large portions of
          which have been redacted.
                         
                          CASE (CONT'D)
           The science team returned after five
           years with a new technology. They
           began the experiments upstairs, then
           they left again and never returned.
           95.
                         
                          BRAND
           Where did they go?
                         
                          CASE
           I don't know. They've deleted their
           mission plan. There's nothing else.
                         
                          DOYLE
           I think I know what the problem is.
                         
          Doyle is manipulating the time component of the map, slowing
          down the passage of time, reversing it, speeding it up.
                         
                          DOYLE (CONT'D)
           Look.
                         
          Doyle speeds up the map until the ice planet is nearly a
          blur, speeding in its orbit around Pantagruel.
                         
                          DOYLE (CONT'D)
           There's a small black hole moving
           into the system. Too small for us
           to have seen in our survey. It's
           not going to hit the planet, but
           it's going to come close.
                         
          A tiny black hole soars through the system. Although it
          misses the ice planet, it deflects its orbit by a tiny degree.
          After a dozen more orbits, the ice planet dips down close to
          Pantagruel's event horizon and is torn apart.
                         
          Brand and the others watch as the sequence rewinds and repeats --
          the planet is pieced back together again and ejected, then
          pulled back in and torn apart. Over and over.
                         
                          DOYLE (CONT'D)
           This place isn't paradise. It's
           doomed. Just like us.
                         
          The crew stand, watching the sequence in stunned silence.
                         
                          COOPER
           How long does this place have?
                         
                          CASE
           A few years. A decade at most.
                         
          Doyle turns to Brand.
                         
                          DOYLE
           So much for the plan.
                         
          Cooper looks at Brand. She is in disbelief, staring as a
          lifetime's training and optimism are torn to pieces.
           96.
                         
                          BRAND
           But I don't understand... why are we
           here? What are we here for?
                         
          Cooper looks down. Brand's upset is turning to anger.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           What the hell are we here for? I
           trained my whole life to reach this
           place.
                         
          She looks at Cooper, questioning.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (GENTLE)
           Maybe... maybe Roth's right... maybe
           we just don't understand it yet.
                         
          She looks down. She knows he doesn't believe what he's
          saying. He's been right all along -- they're alone.
                         
          For a tiny moment, all hope is lost.
                         
          Suddenly, with a distant RUMBLE, the building begins SHAKING.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Case, what is that?
                         
                          CASE
           It's nighttime. The native life-
           forms are mobile again.
                         
          The RUMBLE grows more intense, as if the entire building is
          being gently shaken.
                         
                          COOPER
           No. It's closer than that.
                          (REALIZING)
           Roth.
                         
          The RUMBLE grows. As Cooper watches, Case's rifle slides
          free of the desk. But instead of falling, it simply hangs
          in the air.
                         
          Then he realizes the same thing is happening to them -- his
          boots no longer have traction with the ground. After a second
          everything in the room is floating an inch off of the ground.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Quick -- hold onto something.
                         
          He reaches out to Brand but it's too late -- suddenly they're
          no longer floating, they're falling.
                         
          They're falling up.
           97.
                         
          Cooper, Brand and the rest of them hit the ceiling. Cooper
          picks himself up and adjusts to his surroundings -- up is
          now down. He helps Brand up.
                         
                          DOYLE
           What the hell is happening?
                         
          Case doesn't answer -- he's looking up at the control
          equipment for the holographic display, which is GROANING
          under a load it was never built to handle.
                         
          Case grabs Cooper and Brand and pushes them towards the
          stairwell as the control panel TEARS free of the floor and
          CRASHES towards them.
                         
          Cooper falls into the stairwell -- now they're being pulled
          up and sideways through the stairwell, like an Escher
          painting.
                         
          Brand pushes Cooper out of the way as debris from the control
          panel orbits past them back up towards the lab.
                         
          They try to hang on but the force is becoming irresistible,
          dragging them along the wall of the stairwell and back towards
          the lab upstairs.
                         
          Brand wedges herself against the railing as objects and debris
          are SMASHING against the door to the lab.
                         
          Doyle is trying to hang onto the handrail but his grip slips
          and he CRIES OUT as he falls towards the door to the lab,
          SMASHING it open. Doyle disappears up and into the lab.
                         
          Cooper slips trying to help Doyle. Brand reaches out for
          him...
                         
          Too late. Cooper is pulled through the open door.
                         
          INT. INTACT LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper is pulled through the door and past the control panel.
          He reaches out and grabs the underside of the panel.
                         
          He dangles, the panel cutting into the meat of his hand,
          trying to get his bearings:
                         
          Roth, Doyle, and everything that hasn't been bolted down is
          either pressed against the sphere in the center of the room
          or is orbiting around it.
                         
          Roth, who is laughing, jubilant, shouts up to him:
                         
                          ROTH
           The control panel is beneath you.
           See if you can turn it off.
           98.
                         
          Cooper slips as he tries to reach the controls. Finally he
          finds the controls for the machine.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (YELLS UP)
           I found it. Hold onto something.
                         
          Roth and Doyle crawl up the side of the mass and hold onto
          the support wires.
                         
          Cooper hits a key on the monitor.
                         
          Suddenly, the room inverts again, reverting to a normal
          gravitational field. Cooper floats for a second, then topples
          back to the ground, along with everything else.
                         
          Brand stumbles in to find Cooper sprawled on the floor as
          Roth and Doyle hang onto the sphere for dear life.
                         
          INT. INTACT LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT
                         
          Roth, back on terra firma, is looking at the tiny black box
          he's pried from the center of the sphere. Cooper is looking
          over his shoulder.
                         
                          COOPER
           They found a way to make gravity.
                         
                          ROTH
           Not make it. Adjust it. Dial it
           up, or down. I think they were
           experimenting with it -- firing these
           into the black hole to try to save
           this planet.
                         
                          DOYLE
           All that from one tiny box.
                         
          Roth has hooked the box up to a terminal and it scrolling
          through the incredibly sophisticated machine code, trying to
          parse how it works. Cooper looks on.
                         
                          ROTH
                          (AMAZED)
           It barely uses any power. I'm only
           beginning to understand what it does
           but I think it sends a signal out
           into the bulk. It must tap into the
           same technologies that were used to
           create the wormholes in the first
           place.
                         
                          COOPER
           What does that mean?
           99.
                         
                          ROTH
           It means whoever built the wormhole
           probably doesn't exist inside our
           universe.
                         
          Cooper looks at the tiny box.
                         
                          COOPER
           But how did the Chinese develop the
           technology? This would take decades,
           maybe hundreds of years, to create.

           Wherever they went, they found

           it.
                         
          Brand looks at the box.
                         
                          ROTH
           They came back here and tried to use
           these devices to save this planet.
           But they didn't work. Nothing would
           be strong enough to weaken a black
           hole.
                         
                          BRAND
           Maybe we could work with it. Try to
           improve it.
                         
                          ROTH
           No. You're missing the bigger
           picture. The robots had strict
           mission parameters. They were told

           This. This is the prize.
                         
          He holds up the box.
                         
                          ROTH (CONT'D)
           Don't you see? Earth's gravity is
           like a prison. But this is like a
           master key.

           If we could build more of these, we
           could turn down the earth's
           gravitational field enough to save
           millions of people. We wouldn't
           have to pick a handful of people to
           survive. With this we can save
           everyone.

                          ROTH
           Wherever we want. We don't belong
           in any one place. Can't you see
           that now? Not Earth. Not this place.
           Nowhere. If the human race is going

          Case looks at the box. Makes a decision.
                         
                          CASE
           In the morning we're taking this and
           going home.
                         
          Doyle, Roth and Case set about making preparations to leave --
          gathering space suits, equipment.
                         
          In the bustle, Cooper finds Brand sitting alone, staring at
          the sample of fractal life.
                         
                          COOPER
           I know this isn't exactly what you
           trained for. But I think Roth might
           be right.
                         
                          BRAND
           That doesn't help this planet. This
           creature is doomed. Unlike us it
           doesn't have anywhere to go.
                         
          The fractal organism almost seems to be looking at her, trying
          to comprehend. But it quickly loses interest and goes back
          to breaking itself into pieces and reforming into different
          shapes, trying to escape. Brand sets it back down.

          Morning. Cooper and the others prepare to head out. They
          are laden down with gear -- space suits for the return trip
          to the lander once they reach the surface.

          Cooper stops. He puts a hand on Brand's shoulder. He points
          to the tree line. Something is moving.
                         
                          COOPER

           Who?
                         
          Suddenly, three ROBOT MARINES step out of the jungle, weapons
          raised. They are wearing ghillie suits, pieced together
          from dried dead pieces of the local foliage.
                         
          Under their camouflage, they looks identical to Case. With
          one key difference -- faded red and gold insignias.
                         
          Case steps protectively in front of his team.
                         
          The CHINESE OFFICER steps forward, rifle levelled.

          Sergeant Liu speaks in the same even tones as Case -- they
          were probably built in the same factory before the war.
                         
          Case keeps his rifle raised.

          his mind. Cooper takes a sidelong glance at Brand.

          Cooper nods.
                         
          Case moves. Fast. He FIRES one shot at the nearest robot,
          disabling it, then hurls himself at the remaining two,
          tackling them both over the edge of the ravine.
                         
          Cooper watches them disappear into the void below. Grabs
          Brand and the others.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK -- DAY
                         
          The crew hike towards the ice above.
                         
          Below they hear a metallic BOOM as something heavy hits
          something else -- Case is still fighting. They keep moving.
                         
          EXT. UPPER MOUNTAIN PEAK -- TWILIGHT
                         
          They are high above the Marine camp, only fifty feet or so
          below the massive ice roof of the cavern. The Chinese have
          blasted a tunnel into the ice leading back up to the camp
          above.
           104.
                         
          This high, the air is bitterly cold. Cooper and the others
          are hunkered down, trying to keep warm, waiting for night to
          fall so that they can climb back up to the lander without
          being cooked by the neutron star.
                         
          Finally, above them, the light begins to flicker out. The

          Cooper drags the pieces of the escape rocket out from the
          shelter. Assembly is semiautomatic -- Cooper lifts the pieces

          designed more for a robot than a man.

           earth.
                         
                          ROTH
           You don't need this -- only the idea.
           The knowledge of how to build it.
                         
          Cooper remembers something. Heads back into the shelter.
           106.
                         
          INT. CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Roth follows Cooper into the lab.
                         
          Cooper opens the storage crate. Picks one of the probes at
          random. Sets it down on the bench next to Roth.
                         
          Cooper begins rigging up a connection between the two.
                         
                          COOPER
           I'm going to image the operating
           code and the architecture onto the
           probe's hard drive. It'll be garbled,
           but it should give you and me enough
           to rebuild it when we get back.
                         
          Cooper looks at the probe filling up with data.
                         
                          ROTH
           Not me. But you'll make it work.
                         
          The transfer is complete. Roth hands Cooper the probe, and
          takes the black box himself.
                         
                          ROTH (CONT'D)
           This is a one-way trip for me.
                         
          Before Cooper can respond, Roth heads for the door.
                         
          EXT. CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Roth squeezes himself into the rocket, hugging the black box
          to his chest. Cooper and Brand help him.
                         
                          BRAND
           This isn't right, Roth. We can find
           a way for all of us to leave.
                         
                          ROTH
           This is the only way. Keep the lander
           upright and fire the secondary
           boosters when the moon passes
           overhead.
                         
                          COOPER
           Let me take it.
                         
                          ROTH
           No. You need to make it home. You're
           going to need to build more of these.
                         
          Brand looks at him, heartbroken. Roth smiles.
           107.
                         
                          ROTH (CONT'D)
           I understand the plan, now. Whatever
           happens, you have to keep exploring.
           Keep learning. One good idea isn't
           enough. You'll need more and more
           of them just to survive. Do you
           understand?
                         
                          BRAND
                          (NODS)
           Thank you.
                         
                          ROTH
           Go.
                         
          Brand turns to follow Cooper back.
                         
          Behind her, Roth's rocket LAUNCHES on an explosive cloud.
          In seconds it's high overhead.
                         
          EXT. LANDER -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper checks over the hull, which is intact. Doyle is inside
          looking over the controls. He steps back outside.
                         
                          DOYLE
           Control systems inside are online.
                          (LOOKS UP)
           I've lost sight of the rocket. Do
           you think he made it?
                         
                          COOPER
           We're going to find out soon enough.
                         
          Brand is looking off into the distance.
                         
                          BRAND
           Someone's coming.
                         
          Cooper looks up. A robotlike figure is limping through the
          snowstorm towards them. Cooper raises the rifle.
                         
          Finally he makes out the insignia -- it's Case.
                         
          Cooper and Doyle run out towards him. They reach Case as he
          collapses in the snow. He's badly injured -- one leg torn
          off at the knee, one arm mangled.
                         
          Doyle and Cooper drag the crippled robot back into the ship.
                         
          INT. LANDER -- NIGHT
                         
          They drag Case into the lander. Doyle checks over the ship's
          controls.
           108.
                         
                          DOYLE
           Close the door.
                         
          Cooper moves to the door. Something's wrong.
                         
                          COOPER
           Where's Brand?
                         
          She's nowhere to be seen. Cooper looks out onto the ice.
          Brand is heading back out into the snow.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Dammit. If I don't make it back,
           just keep going.
           (points to probe)
           Get that thing home.
                         
          Cooper steps to the door.
                         
          EXT. SPACE ABOVE ICE PLANET
                         
          The rocket tucks in close behind one of the moons orbiting
          the ice planet.
                         
          The rocket fires to maneuver closer and closer to the moon's
          surface -- the tiny moon doesn't provide enough gravity to
          attract it.
                         
          When the rocket is close enough, Roth detonates the explosive
          bolts holding him inside and leaps for the moon's surface.
                         
          He scrambles to grab hold of the craggy surface. Behind
          him, the rocket smashes apart against the surface.
                         
          Roth finally gets a good hold. He looks down.
                         
          Below him, the view is incredible -- the ice planet curving
          into the distance, Gargantua rising over its horizon.
                         
          Roth looks at the black box in his hands.
                         
          EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Brand is a hundred yards from the lander by the time Cooper
          catches up with her. She is digging in the snow.
                         
          He takes her arm but she won't go.
                         
          She finally finds what she's looking for -- the sample case.
          The tiny fractal life-form is huddled at the bottom.
                         
          Cooper shakes his head and turns back to the lander.
           109.
                         
          EXT. MOON, SPACE OVER ICE PLANET
                         
          Roth is watching the ice planet pass by beneath him. He
          finally sees the distant peaks of the mountain range as it
          punctures the ice near the Chinese camp.
                         
          For a moment he enjoys the view -- the distant hulk of
          Gargantua rising over the horizon of the shining ice planet.
                         
          He takes a final breath and activates the black box.
                         
          Instantly, the moon's gravity is magnified a hundred million
          times over. Roth is instantly crushed as the moon collapses
          around him into a tiny sphere.
                         
          EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper and Brand are only thirty yards or so from the lander.
                         
          Suddenly, the ground beneath them begins to RUMBLE.
                         
          Cooper turns back. A mile back the ground begins to tear
          apart, heaving massive chunks of ice and rock into the sky.
                         
          Roth's moon is racing overhead, TEARING up a massive strip
          of the surface's planet as it nears them.
                         
          Cooper and Brand run.
                         
          EXT. MOON, SPACE OVER ICE PLANET
                         
          The energy being unleashed by the tiny box is incredible --
          millions of times more powerful than an atomic bomb.
                         
          The spray of debris is forming a rooster tail behind the
          moon, rocketing up from the planet's surface.
                         
          EXT. LANDER, SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper has almost made it back to the lander. Behind him,
          Brand stumbles. He turns back.
                         
          Brand is pulling herself up. Behind her, the THUNDEROUS
          EXPLOSIONS as a strip of the planet's surface is hurled into
          space have almost reached them.
                         
          Cooper looks at the ship. He'll never make it if he waits
          for Brand. He turns back to find her.
                         
          He reaches Brand just as the moon's gravity hits them --
          they're hurtled off into space. He grabs her hand.
                         
          Seconds later, everything -- the entire ice sheet, the sea
          and rocks deep below -- is hurled up after them.
           110.
                         
          Brand and Cooper embrace as they rocket up through the thin
          atmosphere.
                         
          Brand looks at him.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (RADIO)
           You caught me. Now what?
                         
          Cooper looks around. They planet's surface is breaking into
          pieces around them.
                         
                          COOPER
                          (RADIO)
           I don't know.
                          (RADIO)
           I figured if you were floating out
           into space, you'd want some company.
                         
          He holds onto her as they fall up and out of the last of the
          planet's thin atmosphere and the blackness embraces them.
                         
                          BRAND
           Between you and utter solitude,
           Cooper, frankly, I'm not sure.
                         
          They reach the apex of their climb and the gravity of the
          planet begins to win out. For a moment they float.
                         
                          COOPER
           Guess you were right -- too much
           gravity, or not enough.
                         
          He smiles, forgetting their predicament for a moment. They
          stare into each other's eyes.
                         
          Then they begin, very gently, to fall back towards the ice
          planet.
                         
          Suddenly, the lander maneuvers beneath them. The airlock
          opens to catch them -- Doyle is at the helm.
                         
          Brand and Cooper pull themselves aboard.
                         
          INT. LANDER
                         
          Cooper closes the door and Doyle rotates the lander outwards.
                         
          Doyle FIRES the engines and the lander continues ascending
          into space as the debris around them begins crashing back
          down towards the ice planet.
                         
          Cooper looks out the window:
           111.
                         
          The moon continues tearing up a massive canyon in the planet's
          surface as it circles out of view.
                         
                          COOPER
           Roth.
                         
                          BRAND
           He's gone.
                         
          Ahead, a shadow looms in the darkness: the Endurance.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
                         
          Brand, Cooper, and Doyle pull themselves out of the airlock
          and scramble to take control of the ship.
                         
          Below them, the surface of the ice planet illuminates as the
          neutron star's x-rays begin to reach it from the far side of
          Pantagruel.
                         
          Doyle finally gets the ship straightened out. Its sole
          remaining engine FIRES, rocketing the ship back towards the
          dark side of the planet, out of view of the neutron star,
          and back towards the original wormhole.
                         
                          DOYLE
           I'm setting a course for the wormhole.
                         
          They're going to make it.
                         
          Cooper and Brand make eye contact -- Brand gives him a tiny
          awkward smile. He returns it, then descends below.
                         
          INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE
                         
          Cooper props Case up against the workbench. He pulls down
          replacement arms and legs from storage bins. Unwraps them
          from their vacuum sealed plastic and bolts them back onto
          Case's chassis.
                         
          Cooper finishes attaching the arm. Case rotates it, checking
          the function.
                         
                          COOPER
           How is that working?
                         
                          CASE
           Very well, thank you.
                         
                          COOPER
           Good. We've already set the course,
           skipper. We're going home.
                         
          Cooper hauls himself back up into the observation level.
           112.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATION LEVEL
                         
          Doyle is setting the controls. The ALARMS on the controls
          have finally abated -- they're out of the danger zone.
                         
                          BRAND
           We're safe now.
                         
          Cooper heads to the communications equipment.
                         
                          COOPER
           Now I know why we weren't able to
           hit the relay. It's not interference --
           the blue-shift from the black hole
           is more than we thought it would be.
                         
          Cooper begins re-calibrating the equipment.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (CONFLICTED)
           Cooper, wait--
                         
          The ship PINGS the relay on the far side of the wormhole.
                         
          There is no response.
                         
                          COOPER
           Nothing.
                          (THINKS)
           Wait. The ship cached one long
           garbled transmission when we first
           fell into the swirl. If we account
           for the blue shift then the computer
           might find something in there.
                         
          Cooper brings up the last garbled transmission they received.
          The computer begins re-analyzing it, piece by piece.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (QUIET)
           Listen to me -- the blueshift also
           means we've lost time. More time
           than we thought we would.
                         
          Cooper looks up at her.
                         
                          COOPER
           How much?
                         
                          BRAND
           A lot... Cooper, maybe it's best if
                          WE DON'T-
                         
          The comms equipment TONES as it translates a packet. Then
          another.
           113.
                         
          Then a FLOOD of communications, one packet a day, hundreds
          and hundreds of packets: images, videos, audio messages from
          family and friends.
                         
          Cooper watches, horrified, as the images play out across the
          screen. He is watching the lives of his family play out at
          light speed. Finally, the packets slow, then stop.
                         
          Cooper looks at the results, in shock.
                         
                          COOPER
           Forty seven years.
                         
          Doyle joins him, staring at the screen, stunned.
                         
                          DOYLE
           My kids...
                         
          Cooper tries to PING the relay again. Nothing comes back.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (GENTLE)
           The relay will have lost power years
           ago. That's why we couldn't contact
           it, even after we reached the planet.
                         
          Cooper is still problem solving, thinking.
                         
                          COOPER
           We could bypass the relay. Send a
           conventional shortwave signal.
                         
                          BRAND
           Only a tiny portion of the signal
           would make it though the wormhole.
           Besides, no one will be listening
           anymore.
                         
          The comms screen is dead. No movement. Nothing.
                         
          Cooper looks at Brand, realizing something.
                         
                          COOPER
           You knew, didn't you? You and Case
           figured it out when we landed.
                         
          Brand looks down.
                         
                          BRAND
           I thought... I couldn't be sure.
                         
                          COOPER
           Sure you could. You're brilliant.
           You know everything.
           114.
                         
                          BRAND
           Cooper... we needed to keep going.
           I'm so sorry. Your children...
                         
                          COOPER
           They're not children any more... if
           they're even still alive.
                         
          He turns away from her.
                         
                          BRAND
           Listen, the important thing is that
           we're going home, now. And we have
           something that can save everyone.
           It's more important than the people
           we left behind-
                         
          Doyle cuts her off, filled with anger.
                         
                          DOYLE
           That's easy for you to say. You
           didn't leave anyone behind.
                         
          Cooper looks at Brand, his anger softened by sadness.
                         
                          COOPER
           Yes she did.
                         
          Brand looks at him, grateful for this small kindness.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           That's why you were upset -- your
           father.
                         
          She looks down, filled with sadness.
                         
                          BRAND
           He's gone. But there are other people
           who still need our help. There's
           still time...
                         
          The ship's controls TONE in ALARM. Brand and Cooper turn:
                         
          Case is standing at the controls.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           Case... what are you doing?
                         
          Case finishes typing in a sequence on the command controls.
          Presses the "execute" button.
                         
          The last nuclear engine begins to detach from the ship.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           Wait... no...
           115.
                         
          The robot turns from them. Cooper notices that the control
          module snapped into the back of Case's chassis is wrong:
                         
          It's red with a gold star. It's not Case at all. It's Liu.
                         
                          LIU
           I'm sorry. I have my orders. No
           one follows...
                         
          Liu stares, satisfied, as the nuclear engine spins away from
          the ship and back down toward Pantagruel.
                         
          Cooper SMASHES Liu from behind. The robot tumbles to the
          ground, the fight gone out of him.
                         
          Cooper and Doyle roll the robot over and Cooper reaches for
          his control module.
                         
                          LIU (CONT'D)
           No one follows-
                         
          Cooper rips the module out. The robot freezes.
                         
          Brand is already at the controls, trying to regain control.
                         
          The instruments TONE, alerting the crew to their position:
                         
          The ship is spinning back down towards the black hole.
                         
                          BRAND
           No... We're being pulled back to
           Pantagruel.
                         
          Cooper, frantically checks the controls, firing the remaining
          boosters.
                         
                          COOPER
           We can't let that happen. We'll
           lose more time... too much...
                         
          The boosters are no match for the deadly pull of the black
          hole below them.
                         
          On the ship's guidance, they watch, helpless, as the ship
          climbs back up the volcano rim towards the critical orbit.
                         
          As on their first trip, the black hole grows to dominate the
          bottom of the sky, and the stars above them become streaks --
          time is speeding for them as they are whirled down into the
          deep gravity well around the hole.
                         
          As they watch, trapped, decades begin to play out in the
          system above them. They watch as the ice planet whirls around
          them, orbiting the black hole dozens of times.
           116.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           We're losing years.
                         
          Finally, the ice planet plunges past them towards destruction.
          As it reaches it slows, until finally it reaches the event
          horizon, just as they saw in the projections. Nothing has
          prepared them for the reality:
                         
          The ice planet is SMASHED apart with stunning violence.
                         
          Brand looks at the sample of fractal life. Now they are
          united -- they are, in all likelihood, the sole survivors of
          their planet.
                         
          Doyle points to the instruments.
                         
                          DOYLE
           The wormhole. Look -- it's being
           pulled into the black hole as well.
                         
          They watch on the holographic model as the wormhole's orbit
          converges on the event horizon of the black hole.
                         
                          BRAND
           It's orbit mirrored the ice planet's.
                         
                          COOPER
           What will happen to it?
                         
                          BRAND
           It'll be destroyed, like everything
           else.
                         
          Cooper struggles to pull himself over to the communications
          screen. Sets it to make a shortwave broadcast. Brand opens
          her mouth to point out that it's futile, then stops.
                         
                          COOPER

          He hangs up the radio.
                         
          In silence, they watch as the wormhole -- their only way
          home -- vanishes beneath the event horizon.
                         
                          DOYLE
           How much time are we losing?

           none of them will make it.
                         
          As Doyle watches the controls the ship continues to spiral
          towards the black hole.
                         
                          DOYLE

          Cooper looks at the controls, an idea forming.
                         
          He pulls himself down. Hauls himself across the deck to
          pick up Liu's chip. He plugs it into a diagnostic tool.
                         
                          BRAND
           What are you doing?
                         
                          COOPER
           Case said the Chinese found something
           else. The location was scrubbed
           from their records. But I bet he
           knows it.
                         
          Cooper fires up the chip. Begins sorting through the onboard
          memory.
                         
          Doyle watches the instruments.
                         
                          DOYLE
           Hurry up.
                         
          Cooper concentrates, poring over the numbers. Finally he
          begins feeding coordinates into the navigation computer.
                         
                          COOPER
           Here. Can we reach it?
                         
          Brand looks at the map. The point appears on the far side
          of Gargantua. Brand studies the trajectory.
                         
                          BRAND
           We can use the thrusters to keep us
           on the critical orbit. Then slingshot
           us towards Gargantua.
                         
          The thrusters STRAIN to push the ship back up towards the
          critical orbit.
           118.
                         
          Suddenly, the tidal gravity SLAMS them against the walls of
          the ship.
                         
          Finally, the thrusters fire again -- a tiny push, but just
          enough to launch the ship clear of the black hole, like a
          rock out of a slingshot.
                         
          The ship races toward the massive hole in the sky below them:
                         
                         GARGANTUA
                         
          EXT. SPACE AROUND GARGANTUA
                         
          The ship picks up more and more speed as it soars closer to
          the massive black hole's event horizon.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
                         
          The sky closes to a tiny hole above them. Gargantua is
          swallowing their view.
                         
          Cooper looks at the radar, which is choked with debris.
                         
                          DOYLE
           We only have a few minutes before
           we're swallowed into that thing.
           What are we even looking for?
                         
          On the radar, a tiny empty spot appears.
                         
                          COOPER
           (points to screen)
           That? What is it?
                         
          Brand looks. In one tiny region on the back side of the
          black hole, the debris simply seems to vanish.
                         
                          BRAND
           It's another wormhole.
                         
          Doyle FIRES the thrusters again, pushing the ship towards
          the wormhole.

          The Endurance spins, shifting paths slightly as it continues
          to race closer and closer to oblivion.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
                         
          They study the controls. The projected path shifts, one
          degree at a time. Finally, it appears to put them on a path
          to hit the wormhole.
                         
          Doyle shuts off the thrusters.
           119.
                         
                          DOYLE
           We're not going to be able to slow
           down. Hold onto something.
                         
          He locks up the controls.
                         
          EXT. SPACE AROUND GARGANTUA -- MORNING
                         
          The ship is tumbling through space, racing toward the second
          wormhole. It is massive, much larger than the first wormhole,
          and it's glowing with a light as bright as a star.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
                         
          The crew brace themselves against the hull of the ship.
                         
          Suddenly the ship slams onto the wormhole mouth and is pulled
          violently into the wormhole.
                         
          WHITENESS.
                         
          As the light fades, Cooper and the others come to.
                         
          The light is rapidly dimming from pure white, fading to a
          deep red, then infrared, finally darkness.
                         
          Cooper looks out. Checks the instruments. Looks out again.
                         
          EXT. VACUUM
                         
          Nothing. Blackness as far as the eye can see. No stars.
          No planets. Just inky darkness stretching on forever.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
                         
          Brand joins Cooper on the deck. Together, they look out at
          the blackness that surrounds them.
                         
                          COOPER
           Where are we?
                         
                          BRAND
           I don't know. It's like we entered
           the wormhole and never left it.
                         
          Brand checks the instruments. There is nothing for the ship
          to model.
                         
          There is nowhere to go. They drift.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
                         
          Days go by. They check the instruments. Still nothing.
          It's as if they have left the known universe altogether.

          Doyle sits down. After a moment, he turns on the screen and
          cues up a message.
                         
          His children appear on-screen, giggling, pushing each other,
          trying to get a prime spot in front of the camera.
                         
          Doyle cups his face in his hands and cries.

          Cooper above his bunk, stares out into the blackness.
                         
          Brand watches him from the doorway.
                         
                          BRAND
           I'm sorry. I should have told you.
           I didn't have the right.
                          (BEAT)
           But you should watch the recordings.
           You should know what happened to
           your kids.
                         
          Cooper ignores her.

          Brand watches her father talking to her on-screen. He is
          twenty years older than when she left him.
                         
                          BRAND'S FATHER
           I'm not going to make it much longer.
           The machines will continue to maintain
           the station as long as they can and
           the communications will run as long
           as the station here still has power.
           I'm sorry. I hope wherever you are,
           darling, you're safe.
                         
          The screen cuts out. Brand watches the static play out.

          Doyle sits at the table. He has found a flair gun in one of
          the ditch kits. It is sitting on the table in front of him.
          The message is clear.
                         
          Brand sits down across from him.
                         
                          BRAND
           Our last trip past the black hole
           cost us another 100, maybe 200 years.
           Which means there's a good chance
           we're the only humans alive anywhere.
           121.
                         
          She stands up.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           I think the last human beings should
           have a little more fight in them
           than that.
                         
          Brand picks up the sample of fractal life and places it under
          a lamp on the counter. It freezes, absorbing the rays.
                         
          Doyle looks at the gun.

          Cooper, in a space suit, steps out of the airlock.
                         
          He drifts out from the ship.
                         
          Nothing. Behind him, the ship is a tiny speck in an ocean
          of darkness.

          Cooper sits down. Turns on the screen.
                         
          After a moment, the camera turns on. Tom, his eldest son,
          still 15 years old, turns on the camera.
                         
                          TOM
           Hi, Dad.
                         
          Cooper pauses it. He can't take it. After a moment, he
          lets it run again.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           I met another girl, Dad. I really
           think this is the one.
                         
          Tom holds up a picture of himself and a teenage GIRL.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Murph stole Grandpa's car. He crashed
           it. He's OK, though. No broken
           bones.
                         
          Cooper leans back.

          Cooper is holed up, still watching, several days' growth of
          beard unshaved. He's been watching for days.
                         
          On the screen, Tom is a grown man in his 20s.

           I've got a surprise for you, Dad.
           You're a grandpa.
                         
          Tom holds up an infant wrapped tight in swaddling. The kid
          is BAWLING.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Congratulations. Grandpa said he
           already earned the "great" bit so we
           just leave it at that.
                         
          The screen cuts out.
                         
          The next message begins. Tom is in his 30s.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Hi, Dad. I'm sorry it's been awhile.
                         
          He stops, emotional.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Grandpa died last week. We buried
           him out in the back forty, next to
           Mom.
                          (LOOKS DOWN)
           Where we'd have buried you, if you'd
           ever come back.
                         
          He laughs, gallows humor.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Murph was there for the funeral.
           It's been a few years since I've
           seen him. He's been down in the
           Gulf Coast. He's an engineer. I
           guess someone followed in your
           footsteps after all.
                         
          Tom looks down.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           You're not listening to this. I
           know that. All of these messages
           are just out there, drifting in the
           darkness.
                         
          He stops for a second.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           You're gone. You're never coming
           back. And I've known that for a
           long time. Lois says -- that's my
           wife, Dad -- she says I have to let
           you go. So I am.
           123.
                         
          He reaches up to turn off the camera.
                         
                          TOM (CONT'D)
           Wherever you are, I hope you're at
           peace. Goodbye, Dad.
                         
          The image freezes, Tom's hand on the camera, then breaks
          apart into digital noise.
                         
          Then nothing.
                         
          Cooper looks at it for a second. Then rises to leave.
                         
          Suddenly, the screen flickers to life again.
                         
          A good-looking man in his late 30s turns on a camera. Cooper
          recognizes him instantly. It's Murph.
                         
          Murph looks at the camera for a long beat, clearly unsure
          about this.
                         
                          MURPH
           Hello, Dad. You sonofabitch.
                         
          He laughs, self-conscious.
                         
                          MURPH (CONT'D)
           It's your 60th birthday today.

           I guess I understand why you left.
           The corn is dying now, too.
           Tom says there's less and less at
           harvest every year.
                         
          He pauses. Lifts up his hand and scratches his stubble.
                         
          Cooper pauses the message. He looks carefully at the screen:
                         
          Murph is wearing his dad's watch.
                         
          Cooper lets the message play. Tears are streaming down his
          face.
                         
                          MURPH (CONT'D)
           Rot's setting in. I guess you were
           right for clearing out while you had
           the chance.

          The video cuts out.
           124.
                         
          A message appears on the screen:

          Cooper is seated, alone. Almost every compartment has been
          opened and emptied -- debris is swirling through the
          compartment.
                         
          Brand walks in. They sit in silence for a moment. When
          Cooper speaks, it's clear his sadness has faded to a gallows
          humor.
                         
                          COOPER
           Not a single drink on the whole ship.

          They sit in silence for a moment.
                         
                          COOPER
           You really think we're the last humans
           alive anywhere?
                         
                          BRAND
           I don't know. Maybe.
           (looks him in the eye)
           Yes.
                         
                          COOPER
           So that's it, then? That's all?
                         
          He looks down, saddened by his own words.
                         
                          BRAND
                          (QUIET)
           It's happened a billion times over.
           Stars explode. The pieces drift in
           space. Gravity pulls them back
           together. They form new stars.
           Then planets. Then us. We die. It
           starts all over again.
                         
          Cooper shakes his head.
                         
                          COOPER
           What about the plan? The grand
           scheme.
           125.
                         
                          BRAND
           I thought you didn't believe in one.
                         
                          COOPER
           I didn't. But you were bringing me
           round.
                         
          He laughs, his anger coming and going in waves.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           What the hell was the point? What
           did it add up to?
                         
                          BRAND
           I don't know. Maybe it just adds up
           to this.
                         
                          COOPER
           This? You're saying the end result
           of ten billion years is the atoms
           from dead stars standing here
           disagreeing with each other.
                         
          She smiles at him. Bittersweet.
                         
                          BRAND
           Maybe that's enough.
                         
          He turns away from her. She takes his shoulder.
                         
          She pulls him into a kiss. His surprise disappears and he
          pulls her to him, kissing her back.
                         
          Their surroundings forgotten, they drift. She LAUGHS gently
          as they bump into a wall and he pushes off of it, sending
          them spinning back into the center of the cabin.
                         
          She pulls his shirt off and it hangs in space. In moments,
          the cabin is filling with discarded clothes, different colors
          and shapes, like a ticker tape parade.
                         
          In the center of the cabin, Brand and Cooper make love.
                         
          INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE -- LATER
                         
          Cooper and Brand embrace, sleeping, drifting in the cabin.
                         
          Suddenly, Doyle's voice calls out from the other cabin.
                         
           DOYLE (O.S.)
           It's happening... it's happening
           again... Get up here...
                         
          Cooper wakes, careful not to disturb Brand. He plucks his
          shirt from the floating laundry pile and pulls it on.
           126.
                         
          INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE
                         
          Cooper hauls himself up into the upper cabin. Doyle is
          standing in the middle of the chamber.
                         
                          DOYLE
           They just appeared.
                         
          A sphere of distortion, like the one they encountered in the
          first wormhole, is directly in front of Doyle, hovering at a
          point in the middle of the cabin.
                         
          Doyle points a finger gently at the sphere, which grows in
          response.
                         
          Brand pulls herself into the cabin. Several more points
          appear, as if they've been summoned by the first.
                         
          Some of the points twist, some of them spin, and some of
          them are motionless.
                         
                          BRAND
           I think these are the creatures that
           built the wormhole.
                         
          One of them begins to move closer to Cooper.
                         
                          COOPER
           This thing is made of... gravity?
                         
                          BRAND
           No. I don't think it's in our
           universe at all. I think it lives
           in the bulk -- the space that the
           wormholes traverse. And it can only
           interact with us using gravity.
                         
          The shape playfully grows around Cooper's hand, bending the
          space it's in, stretching the skin.
                         
          Doyle GASPS as the sphere nearest him moves through his body,
          coming to rest in the middle and bending his entire torso
          like a fun house mirror.
                         
          Suddenly, the sphere wrapped around Cooper's hand begins
          moving, tugging him gently through the cabin.
                         
          In the next moment, all three of them are being propelled
          through the cabin.
                         
          It's a magical moment -- a communion, a dance between
          creatures on either side of a massive, invisible wall.
                         
          Doyle exclaims like a kid on a roller coaster as he is whirled
          around the room.
           127.
                         
          Cooper and Brand collide with each other for a second as the
          bulk beings move them through space. They hold onto each
          other for a moment and then are pulled apart again as the
          whirling dance continues.
                         
          Even the fractal creature is involved -- inside its cage, a
          tiny distortion ripples its fractal skin. The creature breaks
          apart and plays with the distortion around its enclosure.
                         
          Finally, Brand disengages from the dance and pulls herself
          around the lab, looking for some way to try to communicate
          with the creatures.
                         
          She finds two heavy pieces of engineering equipment and moves
          them close to each other, then far apart.
                         
          The bulk beings soon join her, mimicking the motion of the
          pieces of equipment.
                         
                          COOPER
           Can we communicate with them?
                         
                          BRAND
           Where would we even start? Maybe--
                         
          She pull a bag of ball bearings out of a storage bin and
          tears the bag open, releasing a cloud of the tiny shining
          globes into the air.
                         
          For a moment, nothing happens. Then, the distortions begin
          moving through the bearings, shifting them, rearranging them
          into patterns in the air.
                         
          First, they rearrange the ball bearings into clusters, then
          shapes spinning around each other -- planets orbiting around
          a medium-sized star.
                         
                          DOYLE
           That's our solar system.
                         
          After a moment the ball bearings break apart again and
          rearrange into a larger, more complicated system -- Gargantua,
          Pantagruel, and the ice planet.
                         
          Finally, the bearings compress to a two-dimensional sheet.
          Inside the sheet, one solitary ball bearing orbits around
          the stars and then pushes up, off of the sheet, into an
          umbrella shaped space that rises up from the sheet.
                         
                          COOPER
           What is that?
                         
          Brand looks at the tiny particle, floating alone above its
          universe.
           128.
                         
                          BRAND
           That's us. That's where they've
           brought us. We're in the bulk.
                         
          Cooper and Doyle stare at the particle. The map is static
          now.
                         
          Cooper looks around. The distortions have gone. The
          instruments on the ship TONE in alarm.
                         
          Cooper walks through the map, sending the ball bearings
          scattering. He hurries to the instruments. The ship is
          moving -- picking up speed at a huge rate.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           They're moving us.
                         
                          DOYLE
           Where?
                         
          They stand, looking out into the perfect darkness.
                         
          EXT. ENDURANCE, VACUUM
                         
          The ship begins to close in on something in the darkness: a
          tiny point of light.
                         
          As they grow closer, they realize that it's an opening.
          They are inside a massive, hollow sphere. They have been
          the entire time.
                         
          The ship is guided out through the opening at the crown of
          the sphere.
                         
          Below them is an astonishing sight:
                         
          Our entire universe, compressed into a flattened disc, like
          a floor of stars. They are hovering above it, in the bulk,
          the space between universes.
                         
          INT. ENDURANCE, BULK
                         
          Brand and the others stare at the incredible display.
                         
          The ship drops down and begins to orbit around the massive
          hollow sphere between them and our universe, lower and lower
          until it is skimming just above the surface of the sphere.
                         
          In the distance, they can make out a cluster of lights.
                         
                          COOPER
           There's something out there.
                         
          The cluster of lights grows as they are propelled closer:
           129.
                         
          It's a massive space station, built onto the surface of the
          sphere.
                         
          EXT. SPACE STATION
                         
          The Endurance glides to a gentle stop on one of the upper
          decks of the space station.
                         
          After a moment, the airlock to the ship opens and Cooper and
          the others step out, in their suits.
                         
          They walk up to the airlock doors of the station, which open
          automatically.
                         
          INT. SPACE STATION
                         
          After the airlock decompresses, the inner doors open.
          Standing there, waiting for them, is a familiar figure:
                         
          Tars.
                         
                          TARS
                          (DEADPAN)
           I guess this isn't robot heaven after
           all.
                         
          The light on his brow glows and he offers them both a hand.
                         
          INT. GRAND LABORATORY, SPACE STATION
                         
          The humans have taken off their space suits -- the station
          has been built to be habitable by humans -- and are following
          Tars through the massive facility.
                         
                          TARS
           I orbited the black hole seven times
           before I hit the second wormhole.
           Then I drifted until I found this
           place.
                         
          Cooper looks around. The halls are filled with countless
          technological wonders.
                         
                          COOPER
           This is what the Chinese were
           protecting.
                          (LOOKS AROUND)
           How they could have built all this
           in just a handful of years.
                         
                          TARS
           They didn't. It took them four
           thousand.
           (off Brand's look)
           Time moves very slowly here
           130.
                         
                          BRAND
           How do you know?
                         
                          TARS
           Because I've been waiting for you
           for three hundred years.
                         
          Brand looks around at the massive facility.
                         
                          BRAND
           Time. That's what the bulk beings
           wanted to give us. That was the
           treasure the Chinese found. Enough
           time to let us save ourselves.
                         
          Brand looks around. The facility is massive. She sets the
          specimen case down on a table. Even the tiny creature seems
          in awe of the place.
                         
          INT. LABORATORY, SPACE STATION
                         
          Tars shows them a prototype for the gravity machine. It is
          tiny -- increasing G around two spheres that attract each
          other with a tiny force.
                         
                          TARS
           I have catalogued almost everything
           they had built here.
                         
                          COOPER
           Must have taken you a while.
                         
                          TARS
           One hundred and fifty-seven years.
                         
          Cooper shakes his head in disbelief.
                         
                          COOPER
           How are they keeping the lights on
           in this thing?
                         
          Tars, in answer, points to a far door.
                         
                          TARS
           Follow me.
                         
          INT. ENGINE ROOM, SPACE STATION
                         
          A massive reinforced-concrete shell shudders with the energy
          contained within it. The whole room HUMS with power.
                         
          Tars pulls up a display showing the inside of the shell:
                         
          A tiny black hole spins, spewing out massive amounts of power.
           131.
                         
                          TARS
           It's a mini black hole. A remnant
           of the big bang. It will power this
           place forever.
                         
          Tars leads them on.
                         
          EXT. HANGAR, SPACE STATION
                         
          Tars leads them past an incredibly sleek fleet of spacecraft.
          Cooper starts to stop, but Tars doesn't slow down.
                         
          INT. SIMULATION ROOM
                         
          In the center of the room is a giant holographic globe of
          the Earth, perfect down to the tiniest detail.
                         
                          COOPER
           It's a map?
                         
                          TARS
           No. Not a map. This is a simulation
           of the Earth. A perfect simulation.
                         
          Tars touches the control panel. The map zooms in over Europe.
          Down onto Paris. Late 20th century:
                         
          People walk through the streets. A woman stops at a newsagent
          to buy a newspaper.
                         
          Tars touches the controls again and the map zooms out.
                         
                          TARS (CONT'D)
           They tested each of the technologies
           hundreds of times, trying to find
           the one that would cause the least
           damage and still allow us to leave
           Earth.
                         
          Suddenly, the map lights up with atomic explosions in every
          city. The sequence stops, rewinds.
                         
          This time, sped up, the Earth seems to be drying up -- great
          swaths of desert grow across Europe and Asia. Massive
          circular ships are constructed all over the face of the Earth.
                         
                          TARS (CONT'D)
           This was their best solution. A
           massive version of the box we found
           on the ice planet, allowing the entire
           human population to escape.
                         
          At a given moment, the gravity of the Earth is dropped to
          nothing and the massive ships, filled with the entire
           132.
                         
          population of the Earth, lift gently off of the planet in
          search of greener pastures.
                         
          Cooper turns away from the machine, bitter.
                         
                          COOPER
           So why didn't they return? Why didn't
           they save us?
                         
          Brand is staring at the massive map.
                         
                          BRAND
           Because they were too late. By the
           time they found this place, the people
           who sent them were dead. They were
           unable to fulfill their mission.
                         
          Tars points to the next room.
                         
                          TARS
           That was the final problem they tried
           to solve.
                         
          Tars moves on.
                         
          EXT. PLATFORM, SPACE STATION
                         
          Above them, the blackness of the sky is punctuated with
          hundreds of crystal shapes, faintly leaking starlight:
                         
          Wormholes. Brand looks up at them, entranced.
                         
                          BRAND
           Where do they lead?
                         
          Tars looks at an illuminated schematic on one wall, mapping
          some of the wormholes.
                         
                          TARS
           There are millions of them, connecting
           virtually every planetary system in
           the universe. There are thousands
           in our galaxy alone. But the Chinese
           stopped mapping them when they found
           what they were looking for.
                         
          Tars walks further. He stops.
                         
          The platform in front of them is dominated by a gigantic
          version of the black box that Roth found on the ice planet,
          connected to a massive power array, and pointing into the
          dark space above the sphere.
           133.
                         
                          TARS (CONT'D)
           This was their final creation. They
           had to capture the mini black hole
           just to have enough power to try it.
                         
          Several miles above the black box, one of the wormholes glows
          far brighter than the others, crackling with radiation.
                         
                          DOYLE
           What does it do?
                         
          Cooper steps forward. Runs a hand on the cold, strange
          material the antenna is made out of. He knows exactly what
          it does.
                         
                          COOPER
           They weren't interested in the other
           wormholes because their mission was
           to return home. That one leads back
           to Earth. The Earth they were told
           to return to.
                         
          Tars walks to the controls for the device.
                         
                          BRAND
           But that's impossible...
                         
          Tars turns away from the machine.
                         
                          TARS
           It was only used once. The Chinese
           team attempted to travel back in
           time, to Earth just a few years after
           they had left.
                         
                          COOPER
           Did they make it?
                         
                          TARS
           I don't know.
                         
          Doyle looks back to Cooper.
                         
                          DOYLE
           Do you really think it works?
                         
          Cooper looks up at the machine, suddenly determined.
                         
                          COOPER
           We're going to find out.
                         
          Cooper walks out of the room. Brand follows him.
           134.
                         
          EXT. AIRLOCK, SPACE STATION
                         
          Brand follows Cooper as he walks up to the Endurance.
                         
                          BRAND
           You know it doesn't work. Time travel
           isn't possible.
                         
                          COOPER
           You don't know that.
                         
                          BRAND
           Yes, I do. If it worked, the Chinese
           would have suddenly discovered all
           of these incredible technologies.
           But they never made it.
                          (BEAT)
           You can't go back, Cooper. You can
           slow things down, but you can't ever
           go back. Our home is gone.
           (off his look)
           You listened to all of those messages
           from your family. If you had made
           it back, we would already know.
           There would already be some evidence.
                         
          Cooper looks at the machine.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           If you try to use it, you'll die,
           just like the people who built it.
                         
          She puts an arm on his shoulder.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           Roth was right, Cooper. We have to
           keep going. Keep exploring. We
           have an obligation to try to survive.
           From here we could find a thousand
           places where life could thrive. And
           you're going to return to the one
           place where it can't.
                         
                          COOPER
           I made a promise.
                         
          He turns away from her, resolute.
                         
          EXT. HANGAR, SPACE STATION
                         
          Cooper and Doyle check over one of the sleek Chinese
          spaceships.
           135.
                         
          INT. CHINESE SPACESHIP
                         
          Cooper is checking over the controls of the ship. Brand
          walks in.
                         
                          BRAND
           I came to say goodbye.
                         
          Cooper looks up at her.
                         
          INT. HANGAR, SPACE STATION
                         
          Cooper walks Brand back to the Endurance. The ship is packed
          up and repaired. Brand is looking over their work.
                         
                          COOPER
           You could have taken one of the other
           ships.
                         
                          BRAND
           This one's done all right by us so
           far.
                         
          Brand holds up a small sample case containing half of the
          fractal life-form.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           Will you take this with you? It's
           the last of its kind as well. Thought
           we should double its chances of
           survival. In case I'm wrong.
                         
          Cooper takes the sample and looks at the tiny creature inside,
          trying to escape. He sets it inside the ship. Turns back
          to her.
                         
                          COOPER
           Where are you going to go?
                         
                          BRAND
           I don't know. Up there, I guess.
                         
          She points up into the great darkness above them.
                         
          Tars steps down. Moves over to them.
                         
                          COOPER
           You're going, too?
                         
                          TARS
           I'm curious. It's my nature. See
           you down the road?
                         
          Tars shakes Cooper's hand. Heads onto the Endurance.
           136.
                         
                          BRAND
           Come with us. Please. You wanted
           your whole life to explore. This is
           your chance.
                         
          Cooper stares at her. This is what he has always wanted.
          And he has to turn it down.
                         
                          COOPER
           I'm sorry. I have to find out what
           happened to my sons. I promised
           them.
                         
          Brand sees the resolve in his eyes. Knows there's no way to
          change his mind.
                         
                          BRAND
           You're a man who keeps his promises.
           Make me one-
                         
          She takes his hand.
                         
                          BRAND (CONT'D)
           After you're done... come find me.
                         
                          COOPER
           I promise.
                         
          They kiss passionately. Not wanting it to end but knowing
          that it must. Reluctantly, they separate. Brand turns back
          to the ship.
                         
          She pulls herself onto the ship. Cooper steps back outside
          and watches through the tiny window as the Endurance lifts
          off and disappears into the darkness.
                         
          Cooper turns away.
                         
          EXT. PLATFORM, SPACE STATION
                         
          Cooper watches as radiation pours out of the wormhole high
          above them.
                         
          INT. CHINESE SPACESHIP
                         
          Cooper pulls himself on board. Doyle is at the controls.
          He keys the controls and the ship lifts off.
                         
                          DOYLE
           Let's go home.
                         
          The two men sit in silence as the ship arcs away from the
          space station and closes in on the wormhole.
                         
          Cooper hears a familiar CHIRP. He turns around:
           137.
                         
          The probe they took from the ice planet is belted securely
          into one of the seats, filled with the garbled machine code

          Doyle looks back.
                         
                          DOYLE
           We get back to earth, you and I can
           try to make sense of the code.
           Rebuild the gravity machine.
                         
          Cooper stares at it, suddenly realizing something. He
          unbuckles himself.
                         
          Cooper stands and walks over to the probe. Traces the
          familiar stars and stripes carved into its side.
                         
          Cooper stares at the probe, putting it all together.
                         
                          COOPER
           It's going to work.
                         
                          DOYLE
           Of course it's going to work.
                         
                          COOPER
           That's not what I mean. This is the
           probe I found in Galveston.
                         
          Below them, the wormhole breaks as it reaches another wormhole
          mouth that the Chinese have dropped down to a lower gravity
          well, creating a time machine.
                         
          The wormhole mouth is FLARING with radiation.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           Brand said there'd be some evidence
           we'd made it. And there was. This.
           (holds up probe)
           But only this. Everything will be
           destroyed except for this.
                         
          He moves toward Doyle. Doyle stands.
                         
                          COOPER (CONT'D)
           We have to stop.
                         
                          DOYLE
           I don't know what you're talking
           about, but you're not touching the
           controls. I'm going home.
           138.
                         
          Cooper moves closer to Doyle. Doyle pulls out the flair
          gun. Points it at Cooper.
                         
                          COOPER
           You don't need to do this. We won't
           make it back, but this does. The
           secrets are already right on it.
           Maybe someone found it. There's
           hope.
                          (SAD)
           But we don't get to go with.
                         
                          DOYLE
           You're not stopping me. I'm going
           home.
                         
          Doyle forces Cooper into the ship's lander. Then he closes
          the airlock.
                         
          Cooper pounds on the other side of the glass, trying to reason
          with him.
                         
          The landing craft detaches from the ship.

          Cooper watches, helpless, as Doyle's ship races ahead towards
          the glowing wormhole mouth.
                         
          As the ship speeds toward the next wormhole, the radiation
          suddenly FLARES, annihilating the ship and everything in it.
                         
          Almost everything.
                         
          Cooper's landing craft spins away from the wormhole mouth.

          A hole opens in the sky with a FIERY EXPLOSION. As the
          radiation subsides, all that shoots out of the hole is a
          vaporous wisp of atomized metal, and a burned, blackened
          probe, which hurtles toward Earth.
                         
          EXT. SPACE, NEAR EARTH ORBIT
                         
          The probe collides with a satellite, hurling debris into the
          upper atmosphere.

          America, the Gulf Coast.
                         
          -- The probe SMASHES down into a sandbar.
                         
          -- Daylight. A man is descending toward it, dangling from a
          rope. It's Cooper.
                         
          -- Night. A kitchen. A little boy -- Murph -- stares at
          the probe, while Cooper works at it with a blowtorch.
                         
          -- Tars pulls the probe out of the back of a plane.
                         
          -- Brand's father, older, studies the probe. Gives up.

          base, scavenging equipment.

          A combine harvester is dead in a field, service hatch opened.
          A MAN is lying under the machine, working.
                         
          The man hauls himself out from under the huge machine. Dusts
          himself off.
                         
          It's Murph, 30s. He looks at the FARMER who is waiting for
          the verdict. Murph shakes his head.
                         
                          MURPH
           It's done. Auto-pilot's packed up
           for the last time.
                         
                          FARMER
           You can't make it work a little
           longer?
                         
                          MURPH
           Can't do anything for you. There
           aren't any more parts for these.
           Not anywhere.
                         
                          FARMER
           You don't understand. We're getting
           less than a hundred pounds per acre.
           We need to plant more, not less.
                         
          Murph looks around him at the pathetic crop of corn that
          stretches around them. The plants are feeble, barely able
          to support themselves.
           140.
                         
                          FARMER (CONT'D)
           You've got to find us some more parts,
           Murph. It's getting desperate.
           Isn't there anywhere you can look?
                         
          Murph begins packing up his tools, thinking it over.
                         
          INT. HANGAR -- DAY
                         
          Murph stares at the darkened shape of a plane under a tarp.
          He stares at the tarp, unsure if he wants to keep going.
                         
          He pulls the tarp off, revealing Cooper's old Piper Cub. He
          checks over the engine, lights, prop. Turns the key. Fires
          her up. The diesel wakes with a GRUNT.
                         
          EXT. AIRSTRIP -- DAY
                         
          Murph wheels the old plane out onto the field by hand.
                         
          EXT. SKIES OVER THE SOUTHWEST -- DAY

          EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND
                         
          Murph sets the plane down.
                         
          He parks the plane under a copse of trees and climbs down.
                         
          He scans the horizon. Nothing. Is this the place?
                         
          EXT. FOREST -- DAY
                         
          Murph pushes his way through the undergrowth. Stops.
                         
          He's standing at the blast doors to the facility. They've
          been blown open with dynamite.
                         
          INT. NASA FACILITY -- DAY
                         
          Murph lets himself inside. Lights a flare.
                         
          The place has been gutted. Thieves and scavengers have taken
          almost everything.
                         
          Murph finds one of the robots, or what's left of it -- it's
          been stripped, leaving only the bare composite skeleton.
          The empty eye sockets stare back at Murph.
                         
          Murph looks around the place. There is nothing left to
          salvage. He turns to leave. Hears a familiar CHIRP.
                         
          In the corner, under a pile of rain-soaked garbage:
           141.
                         
          The probe.
                         
          No one has bothered to steal it. Murph stares at it.
                         
          INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- NIGHT
                         
          Murph sweeps detritus off of an ancient computer mainframe
          that survived the looting. He hooks the probe up to it.
                         
          After a minute, the screen fills with a picture of an ice-
          covered planet. Then nothing. The rest of the probe's drive
          is filled with garbage, noise.
                         
          Murph switches off the screen.
                         
          He stands. Begins to leave without the probe. Stops. Turns
          back. Picks it up and takes it with him.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, MURPH'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Murph is hunched over the probe, trying to pull data off of
          it with a defibrillator. He has incorporated an ancient
          laptop into the chain, and is tweaking values on it, trying
          to decrypt the contents.
                         
          His WIFE, several months pregnant, turns back to him from
          the stove.
                         
                          MURPH'S WIFE
           Would you get that thing off of the
           table?
                         
          Murph nods, absorbed. Keys in a final tweak to the decryption
          software. Hits return.
                         
          Suddenly, the screen begins filling with data.
                         
          Murph stares at it, wide eyed.

          Murph, now in his 40s, is putting the finishing touches on a
          large machine. Although slightly different, we recognize
          some of the components and their configuration:
                         
          It's a crude version of the gravitational device.
                         
          Murph double checks it, then fires up a small gas powered
          generator. Throws a breaker, feeding power to the unit.
                         
          The unit lights up. HUMS. But nothing happens.
           142.
                         
          Murph, disappointed but undaunted, shuts it down and begins
          checking it over. He hears a noise at the door. Turns back.
          His daughter, Emily, 8, is standing at the door.
                         
                          EMILY COOPER
           Dad? You said you'd take us to the

           Did I?
                         
          He looks at the impossible nest of wires. Shakes his head.
                         
                          MURPH (CONT'D)
           All right. Let me get my jacket.
                         
          Murph picks up his jacket from the workbench. Next to it on
          the bench is a shortwave radio playing STATIC.
                         
                          EMILY COOPER

                          MURPH
           I have no idea.
                         
          Murph switches off the lights and they walk out.
                         
          After a moment, the radio CRACKLES to life in the darkness.

          Murph, 50s, slightly gray, sits at his kitchen table. He
          hears a distant RUMBLE.
                         
          He looks up. His wife is standing by the sink.

                          WIFE
           Out in the barn. She's been tinkering
           with your old projects.
           143.
                         
          Murph stands up. The roof of the barn is visibly shaking.
          He steps outside.

          Murph moves towards the barn, concerned. The shaking is
          growing stronger -- the entire structure is buckling.
                         
          Emily, now 18, backs out of the barn.

           did something wrong.
                         
          Murph puts an arm around his daughter and as they watch, the
          entire barn IMPLODES. Their tractor begins sliding towards
          the wreckage of the barn, chunky tires plowing up the soil.
                         
          Finally, the RUMBLING STOPS as the power lines short out in
          a FIERY display.
                         
          As the dust clears, Murph and his daughter examine the mess:
                         
          The entire barn has been crushed into a tiny ball.
                         
          Murph looks at his daughter.
                         
                          MURPH
           Do you remember what you changed?
                         
          Wide-eyed, she thinks about it. Then nods.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          EXT. EARTH, 2320 -- DAY
                         
          This is North America. But it doesn't look much like it.
                         
          Mother Nature has just about wiped the slate clean. Most of
          the vegetation is gone, and unchecked winds sweep across the
          barren plains. Patches of ice lie think on the ground, as
          if a heavy snow has come and gone.
                         
          SUPER TITLE: "TWO HUNDRED YEARS LATER"
                         
          One of the Chinese spaceships descends through the thick
          clouds above and settles gently onto the plain.
                         
          The hatch opens and Cooper steps out. He takes a cautious
          look around. He is holding the fractal life in its small
          container.
                         
          The clouds are threatening, but the weather looks calm enough
          right here.
           144.
                         
          Cooper starts to walk.
                         
          EXT. COLLAPSED HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          Remarkably, part of Cooper's old house is still standing.
                         
          INT. COLLAPSED HOUSE -- DAY
                         
          Cooper stands in the middle of his kitchen. Two walls are
          missing and the rest is collapsed in a heap. But he can
          still see where he used to feed his kids breakfast.
                         
          He has kept his promise. Several hundred years too late.
                         
          Cooper hunkers down, staring at the space where his kids
          used to be. Rainwater covers the ancient formica.
                         
          It has taken him years to finally reach this place. He has
          had plenty of time to come to grips with what he might find.
          But nothing has prepared him for this:
                         
          He is completely alone. Nothing is left.
                         
          INT. COLLAPSED FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT
                         
          Cooper is still sitting there when the ice storm hits.
                         
          Unchecked by trees or vegetation, the wind rockets through
          the house, blasting Cooper and pelting what's left of the
          structure with fist-sized hail.
                         
          Cooper takes shelter against the remaining wall. He's going
          to have to sit this one out -- the hail and winds are the
          brutal descendants of the weather he knew. They'll finish
          him off if he steps back outside.
                         
          As he watches, the pool of water on the kitchen floor freezes
          over in seconds.
                         
          INT. COLLAPSED FARMHOUSE -- DAWN
                         
          Cooper shivers, pressed against the wall. The storm is still
          raging outside. He is freezing to death. He has to move
          now or he will die. He pulls the hood tight around his face
          and stumbles outside.
                         
          EXT. SNOWBOUND FIELD -- DAY
                         
          Cooper makes his way through the blinding snow. He tries to
          find his way, but the ship has been consumed by the blizzard.
                         
          He stumbles to the ground, dropping the glass case with the
          fractal wildlife in it. The case shatters.
                         
          Cooper tries to stand back up, but his strength is dwindling.
           145.
                         
          As he watches, the fractal wildlife creeps tentatively out
          of its broken habitat. It forms together against the cold.
                         
          After a moment, it burrows into the ice. As it does, the
          ice glows faintly. It seems to be right at home.
                         
          Cooper laughs, glimpsing the outline of a plan. Was this
          what the beings who made the wormhole intended all along?
                         
          Cooper suddenly spots the outline of the ship through the
          driving snow. He stumbles back up to his feet and struggles
          a few more steps, then stumbles again, spent.
                         
          Finally, he sits down in the snow to die.
                         
          As his senses flicker in and out, he is struck with memories
          of his boys, so vivid he reaches out for them, crawling
          forward in the snow.
                         
          He stops, and laughs, remembering what Case told him about
          what happens when humans die.
                         
          He struggles to his feet and stumbles a few more feet,
          eventually coming to rest just steps from the ship.
                         
          Cooper takes a final step. Finally, he collapses under his
          ship, as the wind continues to HOWL around him.
                         
          As the snow clears for a moment, Cooper is alone on a vast
          arctic tundra. He will die alone.
                         
                         BLACK
                         
                         FADE IN:
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY
                         
          Cooper wakes.
                         
          He is in a sunlit room. A breeze rustles the curtains as it
          makes its way in through a large open window.
                         
          Cooper sits up. As he a does, a control panel on the wall
          TONES gently, as if in response to his movement.
                         
          He stands and looks around. He can see sunlight through the
          open windows and hear people -- kids YELLING as they play.
          He moves toward the window. Reaches for the curtains. Before
          he can, the door opens behind him.
                         
          A WOMAN in a white coat steps in, smiling warmly.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           Good morning. Don't go outside just
           yet, Mr. Cooper.
                          (MORE)
           146.
                         
                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
           (offers him a pill)
           This will help with the
           disorientation.
                         
          Cooper opens his mouth to talk, but his voice is cracked.
          He gives up. Swallows the pill.
                         
                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
           Wait a minute for that to take effect.
           It can be a bit of an adjustment.
           (looks him over)
           You had some frostbite. Nothing too
           serious.
                         
          As she talks, Cooper looks past her to the window.
                         
                          COOPER
           Where am I?
                         
                          DOCTOR
                          (SMILES)
           It's a bit of a coincidence, really.
           When the rangers found you, we were
           the nearest facility.
                         
                          COOPER
           What's coincidence? What is this
           place?
                         
                          DOCTOR
           We have a lot to show you.
                         
          The doctor reaches for the curtains. She offers him a hand.
          Cooper declines the help and steps outside.
                         
          EXT. HOSPICE, COOPER STATION -- DAY
                         
          Cooper is standing on a rooftop deck of a four-story building
          in a medium-sized city surrounded by fields. But as the
          road and the buildings stretch into the distance, the
          landscape curves up, not down.
                         
          The entire landscape is contained within a huge cylinder-
          shaped space station.
                         
          Cooper stumbles, and reaches instinctively out. The doctor
          catches him.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           You're OK. We get this from people
           who move here from planetary colonies
           all the time.
           147.
                         
                          COOPER
           Where... where are we?
                         
                          DOCTOR
           Like I said. It was a coincidence.
           There was a facility closer to Earth,
           but they had a problem, so you wound
           up here.
           (off his look)
           This is the Space Station Joseph A.
           Cooper.
                         
          Cooper takes in the incredible surroundings. A thousand
          feet above them, black specks are sprinkled over an ocean of
          green -- Jersey milking cows grazing in a field of wild grass.
                         
                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
           I've got someone who wants to meet
           you.
                         
          Cooper looks at her.
                         
          INT. INTENSIVE CARE ROOM, HOSPICE, COOPER STATION -- DAY
                         
          Cooper steps inside. The room is dark, still, the only noise
          is the labored RATTLE of an old man struggling to breathe.
                         
          Cooper steps closer to the bed. The man's skin is paper-
          thin. He is ancient.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           He was moved here after they found
           you. He's a little old for a
           transfer, but they made an exception.
                         
          Cooper hovers at the back of the room, unsure. He turns to
          the doctor, questioning. Then he notices the pictures on
          the old man's desk:
                         
          There are dozens of them. Children, grandchildren. Then
          the older ones -- the man's own parents. Grandparents.
          Cooper spots a tiny framed picture with someone he recognizes:
                         
          Murph, 80 years old, surrounded by his daughter and her
          family. They are standing in front of a re-opened Cape
          Canaveral, and a huge spaceship under construction.
                         
          Cooper picks up the picture and stares at it.
                         
          The doctor points to a shy little boy hiding behind Murph's
          leg in the picture.
                         
                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
           That's him.
           148.
                         
          She points to the old man lying in the bed.
                         
                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
           His name is Anthony Welling. Anthony
           Cooper Welling.
                          (SMILES)
           He's your great great grandson.
           He's been waiting a long time for
           you.
                         
          Cooper's eyes well with tears. He steps over to the bed and
          looks down at the ancient man, teetering on the edge of death.
                         
          The old man looks at him, eyes widening in excitement. He
          strains, trying to reach the bedside table. He's trying to
          reach the drawer. Cooper helps him open it.
                         
          Inside is a simple, familiar wristwatch. The old man
          carefully takes out the watch. He gives the watch a few
          winds and, hands shaking, offers it to Cooper.
                         
          Cooper, eyes filling with tears, closes his hand over the
          old man's hand, enveloping both the watch and the man's hand.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          EXT. CORNFIELD, COOPER STATION -- MORNING
                         
          Cooper is sitting in a well-appointed office. A middle-aged
          BUREAUCRAT smiles at him from the far side of a huge desk.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           You're a hero, Mr. Cooper. Let's
           just start off by saying that. It's
           an incredible and... unexpected honor
           to have you here with us.
                         
          Cooper smiles, uncomfortable.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)
           None of us would be here without the
           efforts of you and the other
           crewmembers of the Endurance.
           (smiles, unconvincingly)
           So I don't want you to take this the
           wrong way. But there are some
           questions I've been told to ask.
                         
          The man looks petrified, like he's been instructed to grill
          George Washington on his expense reports.
                         
                          COOPER
           Shoot.
           149.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           The rangers who found you reported
           that you had released a sample of an
           alien life-form into the wild. Which
           is, unfortunately, against
           regulations.
                         
                          COOPER
           It was last of its kind. Their planet
           was destroyed.
                         
          The administrator cues up a series of images on his computer.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           The rangers attempted to isolate the
           life-form, but it had already spread
           out of control. It seems to be
           thriving.
                         
          He shows Cooper a satellite image of north america. A
          considerable portion of the frozen tundra is glowing.
                         
          Cooper begins laughing. Which makes the administrator even
          less comfortable.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)
           Can you tell me why you... elected
           to release the life-form back on
           earth?
                         
          Cooper is still laughing.
                         
                          COOPER
           Because that was the plan.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           Whose plan?
                         
                          COOPER
                          (SMILES)
           I don't know.
                         
          The administrator tries to smile back. Makes a few notes in
          his file. Changes the subject.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           My assistant tells me you've applied
           for a position with the exploration
           fleet.
                         
                          COOPER
           Feel like I should be pulling my
           weight.
           150.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           That's admirable, Mr. Cooper. The
           truth is, most of the fleet's
           personnel are automated. There are
           a small number of crewed ships. But
           there are great numbers of candidates.
           Very well trained candidates.
                         
                          COOPER
           I was hoping to enroll in a course.
           Try to get myself up to speed on the
           new systems.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           I don't want you to take this the
           wrong way, Mr. Cooper -- like I
           said, you're a hero. But the truth
           is we have somewhat limited resources.
                         
          Cooper remembers this conversation. He looks down.
                         
                          COOPER
           No one's heard anything from Brand?
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           I'm sorry. Officially, she's been
           listed as missing for over 200 years.
           Mind you, I guess you turned up
           eventually, didn't you?
                         
                          COOPER
           Am I really going to hurt anybody by
           going to look for her? I just need
           a small ship. I made a promise.
                         
          The bureaucrat looks down. Is he really going to have to
          tell this guy the lay of the land?
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR
           Listen. Mr. Cooper. You're a hero.
           You're the oldest man in the human
           race. Don't you want to take it
           easy?
           (off his look)
           I hope you understand, we all you
           hold you in the highest possible
           regard.
                          (QUIET)
           Which is why they're never going to
           let you go off by yourself in a
           spaceship. I'm sorry.
                         
          Cooper looks at his hands. He's got a couple centuries on
          the bureaucrat in Earth years, but looks ten years younger.
          He puts his hands in his pockets.
           151.
                         
                          ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)
           I've got some good news, however.
                          (BIG SMILE)
           We all know about your early life,
           Mr Cooper. I wrote a paper on it
           when I was a boy. And I think we
           found something you'll really enjoy.
                         
          EXT. CORNFIELD, COOPER STATION -- DAY
                         
          Corn blows in an artificial breeze. A red tractor makes its
          way through the field, which curves gently up in the distance.
                         
           ADMINISTRATOR (V.O.)
           The machines do most of the work, of
           course, but we were able to get you
           a few acres. You're going to be a
           farmer again.
                         
          After a moment, the tractor stops. Cooper climbs down from
          the seat. Looks at the front steering linkage, which is
          jammed with an errant tree branch. He wipes his forehead
          and begins working the branch out of the machine.
                         
          He looks miserable.
                         
          A robot, a similar unit to Tars, walks over. Offers Cooper
          a bottle of water. Cooper accepts it.
                         
          EXT. HANGAR BAY, COOPER STATION
                         
          Cooper stands on an observation deck, high above the hangar
          floor. Below him, bright young things in uniforms climb
          into sleek-looking spaceships and prepare to set out.
                         
          EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND, COOPER STATION
                         
          Cooper sits in the stands, listening to the familiar crack
          of the bat as an intramural team from the university
          practices.
                         
          Cooper watches. He looks bored.
                         
          The kid up to bat cracks a pop fly. For a second, the catcher
          shuffles back and forth, trying to get himself into position.
          But the ball never returns. The catcher YELLS out a warning.
                         
          Above, the ball begins to slowly fall up, not down, toward
          the town center above.
                         
          After a second, the ball smashes through a skylight of a
          building high above them.
                         
          Cooper watches as the kid rounds the bases, laughing.
           152.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- DAY
                         
          Cooper's robot sits at the kitchen table. Cooper is fiddling
          around in the back of his head.
                         
                          ROBOT
           Settings: general settings, security
                          SETTINGS--
                         
                          COOPER

           percent.
                         
                          ROBOT
           Confirmed. Would you like to make
           any additional changes?
                         
                          COOPER
           Sense of humor. New level setting.
           100 percent. Wait.
                          (THINKS)
           80 percent.
                         
          He begins putting the robot back together.
                         
          EXT. FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- TWILIGHT
                         
          Cooper sits on his porch, joined by the same robot as before.
          They watch as the space station rotates lazily out of
          alignment with the local star, casting the inside of the
          cylinder into shade, then darkness.
                         
          The shadow races past them. Another day. Another night.
                         
          EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION
                         
          A maintenance worker finishes looking over one of the sleek-
          looking spacecraft. He packs up his tools and heads out.
                         
          After a moment, two figures pick their way across the hangar
          floor, sticking to the shadows.
                         
          As they reach the first ship in the line, we get a better
          look. It's Cooper and his robot pal. The robot is wearing
          a baseball cap and carrying a toolbox.
                         
          Cooper gestures to the robot, who sets down the toolbox with
          a click against the mirror-like floor.
                         
          Cooper shakes his head, annoyed, at the robot, and puts his
          finger to his lips. The robot nods, bashful.
                         
          Cooper waves a small handheld computer near the skin of the
          ship until it lights up. Then he punches in a few codes.
          Nothing happens. He punches in a few more.
           153.
                         
          Suddenly, the hatch opens with a HISS.
                         
          INT. SHIP
                         
          Cooper moves quickly to the cockpit of the ship. Looks over
          the controls. The robot straps himself in next to him.
          Cooper looks up through the windows.
                         
          The inky black void of space beckons.
                         
          Cooper smiles and reaches for the controls.
                         
                          COOPER
           Where do you want to go first?
                         
          The robot thinks it over.
                         
          EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION
                         
          The technician walks back into the hangar. He walks along
          the row of ships till he reaches the last one.
                         
          It's not there.
                         
          He looks out into the blackness of the void. Sees a tiny
          glowing speck, getting smaller and smaller.
                         
                         END

          COSTELLO's profile passes in a dark room.
          
                                 COSTELLO (V.O.)
                       Years ago, we had the Church. That
                       was only a way of saying we had
                       each other. The Knights of Columbus
                       were head-breakers. They took over
                       their piece of the city.
          
          EXT. SOUTHIE. VARIOUS
          
          The neighborhood. 1980's. We won't be here long. This isn't
          where Costello ends up. It's where he began. Liquor stores
          with shamrocked signs. MEN FISHING near Castle Island.
          Catholic SCHOOLKIDS playing in an asphalted schoolyard.
          
                                 COSTELLO (V.O.)
                       Twenty years after an Irishman
                       couldn't get a job, we had the
                       presidency. That's what the niggers
                       don't realize. If I got one thing
                       against the black chaps it's this.
                       No one gives it to you. You have to
                       take it.
          
          INT. LUNCH COUNTER. DAY
          
          COSTELLO comes in. The shop is one that sells papers,
          sundries, fountain drinks...and fronts a bookie operation.
          
                                 YOUNG COSTELLO
                           (leaning over cluttered
                            counter)
                       Don't make me have to come down
                       here again.
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                        2.
          CONTINUED:
          
          
                                 PROPRIETOR
                       Won't happen again, Mr. C.
          
          The frightened proprietor hands over money. Fifty bucks, a
          hundred, doesn't matter. COSTELLO is never the threatener.
          His demeanor is gentle, philosophical. Almost a shrink's
          probing bedside manner. He has great interest in the world
          as he moves through it. As if he originally came from a
          different world and his survival in this one depends on close
          continual observation and analysis.
          
          YOUNG COLIN looks up. CLOSE ON his eyes. He is fourteen or
          fifteen, but small for his age. Bookish.
          
          COSTELLO eyes the proprietor's TEENAGE DAUGHTER, working
          behind the counter. He takes a propane lighter, and,
          strangely, pays for it (the proprietor startled) and waits
          for change. He lights a MORE cigarette with the lighter.
          
                                 YOUNG COSTELLO
                       Carmen's developing into a fine
                       young lady. You should be proud.
                       You get your period yet, Carmen?
          
          The PROPRIETOR is uneasy. COSTELLO turns to YOUNG COLIN
          (about 14) staring at the local hero. Costello reaches up
          above and behind the counter and takes down some cigarettes.
          
                                 YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                       You Johnny Sullivan's kid?
          
          COLIN nods.
          
                                 YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                       You live with your grandmother?
          
          COLIN nods.
          
                                 YOUNG COLIN
                       Yeah.
          
          COSTELLO tells the Proprietor to takes three loaves of bread
          and some soup off the shelves and puts them in Colin's bag.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       Get him three loaves of bread. And
                       a couple of half gallons of milk.
                       And some soup.
          
          He goes over to the fridge and puts two half gallons of milk
          in the bag. Some soup. Costello turns to Colin.

                    Do you like comic books?
          
          Colin nods.   He adds a couple of comic books.
          
          When the PROPRIETOR looks at him, he takes out the money he
          put in his pocket and gives back half.
          
                              YOUNG COSTELLO
                    You do good in school?
          
          YOUNG COLIN nods, holding the big bag of loot.
          
                                 COLIN
                    Yes.
          
                              YOUNG COSTELLO
                    That's good. I did good in school.
                    They call that a paradox.
          
          He gives some money to Carmen.

                    Buy yourself some makeup. Keep the
                    change.
          
          Looks intently at COLIN to see if he gets it.    Colin does.
          
                              YOUNG COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                    You ever want to earn a little
                    extra money, you come by L street.
                    You know where I am on L street.
          
          COLIN nods: everybody does.
          
                                 YOUNG COLIN
                    Thank you.
          
          He pushes out with the bags of groceries.
          
          The PROPRIETOR can do shit about it.

          COSTELLO is talking informally (we realize that this is a
          continuation of the philosophical talk, the shadowy pacing).
          YOUNG KIDS. Useful young men. YOUNG COLIN, three years older,
          is among them.
          
                                 YOUNG COSTELLO
                       Church wants you in your place.
                       What sort of man wants to be kept
                       in his place? Do this don't do
                       that, kneel, stand, kneel,
                       stand...I mean if you go for that
                       sort of thing...
          
          YOUNG COLIN, the recent altar boy, visibly doesn't go for
          that sort of thing.

                       I don't know what to do for you. A

          to read the questions.

          BILLY, wearing a State Police sweatshirt is running,

                       She tells me, you never finish
                       anything.
                           (puff puff)
                       You finish the police course you
                       get taken care of again baby.
                           (puff puff)
                       So after graduation
                           (puff puff)
                       I get a blowjob again.

                       That's great. Your mom must be a
                       wonderful woman.

                       Look at it this way, you're a black
                       guy in Boston. You don't need any
                       help from me to be completely
                       fucked.

                       Ways to get ahead, though, man,
                       ways to get ahead.

          BROWN is left thinking about this.

                       This is not the regular police.
                       This is the state police. Your
                       training will illustrate the
                       difference. What's the difference?

                       Sir, I was agreeing with you about
                       our obvious superiority to other
                       forms of police, sir.
          
                                 DRILL INSTRUCTOR

          INT. A CRACKHOUSE. DAY.
          
          COLIN, four years a veteran of the gang unit, is on the job,
          on a raid, clearing rooms, part of a team working with
          massive aggression. He moves through a door. A SAD SACK OF
          SHIT is throwing drugs out a window.
          
                               COLIN

                    Douchebag!
          
          COPS enter past Colin and pigpile the man. COLIN is chewing
          gum, all testosterone and aggression, glad to be a cop. The
          smartest guy in the room.

          A BLACK-WINDOWED, MODERN, POLICE BUILDING, beetling over a
          plaza. Older Boston reflected in the featureless glass. The
          Boston of this film is almost futuristic. COLIN looks up at
          the building with great intensity. He puts on his sunglasses
          and walks towards the door.
          
          INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          COLIN, in civvies (a very good suit), stands at suave
          attention before CAPTAIN QUEENAN, a mild and scholarly man
          who might as well be a Jesuit history-teacher.
          
                              QUEENAN
                    Congratulations on passing the
                    detective exam, and welcome to the

                    We won't be working directly
                    together, you'll be working for
                    Captain Ellerby, but I like to see

          As COLIN leaves the office, looking very satisfied and not a
          little saturnine (it's not as if he isn't pleased by
          recognition and it's not as if he won't get revenge on
          Dignam), he barely glances--and does not actually see--the
          TRAINEE sitting off to one side. He sees polished brogues,
          and walks on.
          
                                 QUEENAN'S SECRETARY

                                 COLIN
                       Thanks, hon.
          
          As COLIN leaves she moderates her expression and:

          him. He has his interview on his mind.

          BILLY has no idea why he is in this room with the brass.
          Sgt. Dignam is staring at him aggressively, with contempt,
          stirring his coffee. DIGNAM is more intelligent than he

                       and leave it there. No idea. Zip,
                       none. If you had an idea about what
                       we do we would not be good at what
                       we do. We would be cunts. Are you
                       calling us cunts?
          
          BILLY wouldn't normally take crap from this guy; but he does.
          He's openly intrigued by the situation. Dignam is staring at
          him. BILLY looks evenly at QUEENAN.

                       Staff Sergeant Dignam has a style
                       of his own. I'm afraid we all have
                       to deal with it.

                    I don't have any family.
          
          EXT. HUNTINGTON AVENUE. LATE DAY
          
          A TROLLEY goes past. HOSPITAL HILL, above the trolley line,
          is sinister, quiet. HOSPITAL at the top like a malign
          fortress, above rows of endlessly repeated condominiums.
          BILLY CROSSES from the Trolley stop, desperately, an angry
          young man at his life's turning point.
          
          INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM. LATER
          
          BILLY'S MOTHER lies as if floating in her bed. Tubes, lights.
          A bald head on a barely-dented pillow. She is a cancer
          patient in a coma, weighing possibly 80 lbs. Gasping for air.
          Her airways are cleared with a suction tube. BILLY sits
          watching as the tube goes in. BILLY sits looking at her.
          
          EXT. THE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. LATER
          
          BILLY is leaning against a wall. A maternal WASP UNCLE, a not-
          bright guy (pretensions, rather than status), speaks briefly
          to a DOCTOR further along the hall, then approaches BILLY,
          hands in the pocket of a good suit.
          
                              WASP UNCLE
                    What's this I hear from Stephanie
                    about you becoming a policeman?
          
                              BILLY
                    You mean Stephanie who was the only
                    one who came to my father's
                    funeral? That Stephanie?
          
                              UNCLE
                    That Stephanie.
          
                              BILLY
                    Nothing much to it Uncle Edward.
          
                              UNCLE
                    Are you trying to prove something
                    to the family?
          
                               BILLY
                    When you say "family", what do you
                    mean? You?

                                  UNCLE
                       You always question everything,
                       don't you?
          
                                  BILLY
                       Yeah, well, maybe it would have
                       done you some good to have a
                       question from time to time. "Am I
                       an asshole?" "Are my kids a mess?"
                       "Is my wife a money-grubbing
                       whore?" Those are questions.
                            (the UNCLE starts to
                             leave)
                       "Have I been good to my dying
                       sister or am I just pretending to
                       be?"
                            (he's stung THE UNCLE)
                       Too late now, right?
          
                                 UNCLE
                       Do you need some money for the
                       funeral?
          
          THE UNCLE moves away, bends to get his overcoat.
          
                                 BILLY
                       When my mother dies we don't have
                       any connection. You got it?

          A REALTOR switches on lights. An empty, flash apartment above
          the Parisian rooftops of Beacon Hill. A view of the Dome.
          More than you'd think a cop could afford. We see, as COLIN
          does, beyond his reflection in the glass, the STATE HOUSE
          DOME.

                       ceilings, parquet floors. There's a

          BILLY sits on a bench looking out over the whole city. (It is
          the best view of Boston, never seen in a film). He's smoking
          a cigarette, making his decision.

                                 QUEENAN
                       During the war, Churchill used
                       river mines. He'd float them down
                       the rivers into Germany. They'd
                       either hit something, or not.
                       That's what we'll use you for. I'll
                       float you down the river. The rest
                       will happen. Or it won't...

                       By the way, this isn't police work
                       for peanuts. There's money behind
                       this operation. You won't be paid
                       as a cop, but there is a bonus
                       involved. Tax free.

                       Somebody, as you may already know,
                       stole one hundred microprocessors
                       from the Mass Processor Corp out
                       Route 128. They're the kind of
                       processors they put into computers
                       that can put a cruise missile up
                       the ass of a camel from the other

                       they do out there on "America's

                    Not a cop. He got out of the joint
                    three weeks ago. Dead up. He talks
                    like his shit don't stink but he's
                    good people.

                              MISTER FRENCH
                    I knew his father. I liked his
                    uncle Jackie better.
          
                              SEAN
                    Uncle Jackie was excellent.
          
                              AN IRISH VILLAIN
                    Fucking guineas.
          
          They solemnly toast uncle Jackie and his fate among the
          fucking guineas. Across the crowded room, BILLY is ordering
          at the bar.
          
                              BILLY
                    A cranberry juice.
          
                              WELL-DRESSED SCUMBAG AT BAR
                    It's a natural diuretic. My
                    girlfriend drinks it when she got
                    her period.
                        (to BILLY)
                    You got your period?
          
          BILLY glances over at the table where MISTER FRENCH sits with
          SEAN, and then smashes his glass into the face of the WELL
          DRESSED SCUMBAG. He stands waiting for the SCUMBAG to get up
          he is grabbed and shoved against the wall by MISTER FRENCH.
          Popped into a pay phone hard. The pay phone comes off the
          hook.
          
                              BILLY
                    Get your hands off me.
          
                              MISTER FRENCH

                       I'm the guy who tells you there are
                       guys you hit and there are guys you
                       don't. That's not quite a guy you
                       can't hit, but it's almost a guy
                       you can't hit, so I'm fucking

          EXT. A HOUSING PROJECT IN SOUTHIE. DAY
          
          COLIN and BARRIGAN (who Colin has moved to plain clothes)
          stand at the door, talking, or trying to talk, with a fearful
          MRS KENNEFICK. MRS KENNEFICK looks like she starts drinking
          whiskey at 9 in the morning.
          
                              COLIN
                    Mrs. Kennefick, Myles and I were in
                    school together. Myles was behind
                    me in school but I knew him. I will
                    get those responsible. Don't you
                    want to see us catch whoever used
                    him to do a robbery and then killed
                    him?
          
                                 MRS KENNEFICK
                    Allegedly.

                              MRS KENNEFICK
                    If he was killed he probably did
                    something wrong.
          
                              COLIN
                    You don't mean robbery do you, Mrs
                    Kennefick? That's not what you
                    think he did wrong.
          
          MRS. KENNEFICK notices COSTELLO driving by.

          She slams the door. As COLIN walks away from the door he
          notices the TAIL: a maroon sedan and a damaged white delivery
          van.
          
                              COLIN

          INT. THE ELEVATOR AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS. DAY
          
          COLIN boards with a bunch of other cops and workers. On
          board, directly beside him, is MADOLYN. COLIN's age,
          beautiful, wearing a business suit. She has a thick stack of
          medical-looking files. She's a psychiatrist on contract to
          the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. She does probation
          counselling work with "violent offenders" and also sees
          policemen.

                       who you are.
          
          MADOLYN nods, and then because this is a (relatively)
          sensitive subject ignores COLIN, but she is visibly attracted
          by him.
          
                                 COLIN (CONT'D)

                              COLIN (CONT'D)
                    I'm only joking. Nice to meet
                    you... "Madolyn".
          
          The doors close. The elevator takes him up. He takes out his
          cellphone as if he's forgotten something. As the doors open,
          the signal bars light up, and the phone rings.

                        (walking, voice low)
                    I didn't know about your tail until
                    I saw it myself. I couldn't call, I
                    had the other guy with me. Blue
                    sedan and a white delivery van,
                    fucked up with graffiti on the
                    side. The van is audio
                    surveillance. OK, have a nice day.
          
          INT. A COFFEE SHOP IN SOUTHIE. MORNING
          
          The same shop in which YOUNG COSTELLO talked to YOUNG COLIN,
          all those years ago. Two ITALIANS are in the shop, talking
          hard to the Pakistani PROPRIETOR (SINGH). These are hard guys
          but they're not being threatening, just persistent: the guy
          DOES owe them money. BILLY is finishing his breakfast.
          Watching. He goes over. The two GUINEAS are amazed. [Dialog
          on separate document].
          
          Billy is finishing his breakfast. Watching. He goes over....
          
                              BILLY
                    You guys from Providence?
          
          The GUINEAS look at him. The younger one moves to intervene.
          BILLY smiles and destroys them both. Maniacal violence. The
          biggest beatdown in gangster movie history--and obviously
          that's saying something. In the course of the beat-down Billy
          breaks his left hand--a "boxer's fracture". BILLY stands over
          his victims, breathing hard, holding his broken hand.
          
                              PROPRIETOR
                    What have you done to my place! Get
                    out of here.
          
          BILLY goes.
          
          INT. EMERGENCY ROOM. NIGHT
          
          BILLY, unlit cigarette in his mouth, is having his hand
          wrapped in plaster by a lady doctor. In another life he might
          have dated her. Not in this one.
          
          INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT. NIGHT
          
          A romantic restaurant. The best Boston has (which isn't
          saying much, but whatever). COLIN, looking great, a man on
          the rise. MADOLYN in pearls, also looking great. But maybe
          the conversation has lapsed and the date gone south.

                                 MADOLYN
                       That's right. I see "violent
                       offenders".
          
                                   COLIN
                       Bad guys.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       That's one way to look at it.   Not
                       necessarily.
          
          COLIN wonders if she's breaking his balls. A DESSERT arrives:
          some towering Japanesey concoction with a fan of sugar candy
          spines, sitting in a pool of sauce. COLIN looks at it, fork
          poised. MADOLYN looks at it. He looks up at her.
          
                                 COLIN
                       That have this and they don't have
                       duck l'orange.
          
          MADOLYN smiles: she likes him. Even with the dinner-long
          bitterness over the duck l'orange.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       Was your dinner OK?
          
                                 COLIN
                           (holding balloon of
                            inappropriate wine)
                       Oh, the lobster was excellent. I
                       just thought, French restaurant...
          
          The look at the dessert.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       I'm waiting for you to make your
                       move.
          
                                 COLIN
                       I don't know what you're gonna do,
                       but if it moves I'm going to arrest
                       it (shoot it).
          
          MADOLYN laughs.    COLIN sees his shot: he's got her laughing.

                    What's it like having people "find
                    themselves?" All day long people
                    "finding themselves." Does it get
                    messy with all those feelings
                    flying around the room?
          
                              MADOLYN
                    Why, does that make you
                    uncomfortable?
          
          Colin stares at her.    Water glass nearly goes over.
          
                              MADOLYN (CONT'D)
                    You know what Freud said about the
                    Irish?
          
                                 COLIN
                    Yes I do.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    If you actually do I'll see you
                    again.

                               MADOLYN

                         unexpectedly)
                    Don't you?
          
                              COLIN
                    Yes, course I do.
                        (a beat)
                    What Freud said about the Irish is
                    We're the only people impervious to
                    psychoanalysis.
          
          MADOLYN is impressed.
          
                              COLIN (CONT'D)
                    Tough luck for you with a client
                    list of Mick cops, isn't it.
                    "Opening up"? Good luck to you.
          
          COLIN laughs but looks nervous about the concept of "opening

                    Fair enough.

          INT. A HORRIBLE BAR IN SOUTHIE. NIGHT
          
          A slow night. BILLY IS AT THE BAR bent over a glass of
          cranberry juice. The women available are two CRONES. [Dialog
          on separate document]. Stark contrast to COLIN'S EVENING. A
          BOOKMAKER on the phone. BILLY, by the glances of people
          looking at him, has made his bones. He's treated with
          respect. His hand and wrist in a cast. Out of nowhere (though
          Billy is aware conversation has stopped he does not look
          around)...
          
          COSTELLO sits down beside him AT THE BAR.
          
          BILLY observes:
          
          MISTER FRENCH sitting down at a far table. Watching. Covering
          the room.
          
          COSTELLO is brought a glass of water by the silent bartender.
          No sound whatsoever in the bar.

          They say nothing, look at each other. BILLY notices DELAHUNT
          and FITZY, entering. They stand by MISTER FRENCH.
          
          BILLY sits motionless.

                       the other night.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Is his real name Mister French?

                       I'm not the cops. I'm not askin'
                       you.
          
          BILLY stands up. MISTER FRENCH stands up. BILLY, COSTELLO,
          and MISTER FRENCH move towards the back room. As they walk to
          the back room of the bar, we hear COSTELLO:
          
                                 COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                       You know something, they just do
                       not stop having the Mafia in
                       Providence, and this can cause
                       problems for me.
          
          INT. BACK ROOM OF THE BAR. CONTINUOUS.

                       Those guys you tuned up are
                       connected down Providence. What
                       they're going to do is come back up
                       with some guys and kill you.
                       Which, sure as you're born, they
                       will do unless I stop them. Do you
                       want me to stop them?
          
                                 BILLY
                       Is it something I can't do
                       personally?

                       Contra-fucking-band.    Take your
                       fuckin' shoes off.

                       Shoes off.
          
          BILLY slips out of them. MISTER FRENCH inspects the shoes.
          COSTELLO'S cold eyes are on BILLY. MISTER FRENCH searches
          BILLY. Looks into his wallet. The wallet is emptied onto a
          table.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       I knew your father.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Yeah. He's dead.
          
                                    COSTELLO
                       I'm sorry.     How did he go?
          
                                 BILLY
                       He didn't complain.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       That was his problem.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Who said he had a fuckin' problem.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       I just said he had a fuckin'
                       problem. There's a man could have
                       been anything.

                    Are you saying he was nothing?
          
                              COSTELLO
                    I'm saying he worked at the
                    airport.
          
          COSTELLO turns to MISTER FRENCH.
          
                              MISTER FRENCH
                    He's clean.
          
                               COSTELLO
                    The arm.
          
          With amazing violence MISTER FRENCH smashes the cast on the
          corner of a table. Billy drops to his knees in tears of pain.
          MISTER FRENCH sorts through the pieces of the cast. Ad libs:
          "such a fuckin' pussy."
          
                              COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                        (holding Billy by the
                         collar)
                    It makes me curious to see you in
                    this neighborhood. Regressing.
                    And, if I can slander my own
                    formative environment, it makes me
                    sad, this regressing. Plus, I don't
                    know if it's beyond some cop prick
                    like fucking Queenan to pull you
                    out of the Staties, and send you
                    after me. I just can't know. I
                    don't know what they do in...that
                    department, anyway.
          
          He grabs Billy's broken right hand.
          
                              COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                    Are you still a cop?
          
                               BILLY
                    No.
          
          COSTELLO twists Billy's broken hand.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    You swear on your mother's grave
                    that you're not a cop.
          
                              BILLY

                    Yes!
          
          COSTELLO lets go of Billy's hand. Billy is weeping on the
          floor. COSTELLO straightens his suit.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    Take it easy. Get your hand taken
                    care of. I'm sorry. It was
                    necessary. As for our problem with

                       Hi, Captain. And our primary
                       target is obviously Frank Costello.
                       But we don't communicate with
                       anyone else in this shop. Queenan
                       is compartmentalizing everything in
                       SIU. It's the right thing to do,
                       personally I don't trust these
                       fucking troopers either. We think
                       we might have a problem. We think
                       Costello's got a rat in the State
                       Police.

                       No. Ah...not presently. Not
                       presently. But I'm hoping to get

                       Bingo. Anyway, I like a guy who
                       goes around knocking guys teeth out
                       for no reason.
          
          He takes out a cell phone and hands it to BILLY.

                       Here. From now on call the bar and
                       ask for Mikey. Just Mikey. You ask
                       for Mikey because there's no Mikey.
                       Wait. We'll call.

                       Forty-eight hours from the time
                       this phone first rings, you take
                       the fucking chip out - like so -
                       and you fucking destroy it. After
                       three days a phone ain't clean. If
                       you use a phone which is not clean,
                       you will have a accident. You never
                       call us. We call you. You got that?
          
                                   BILLY
                       I got it.
          
                                 MISTER FRENCH
                       I can't fuckin' hear you.
          
                                   BILLY
                       I got it.

          INT. A HARBOR RESTAURANT. BOSTON. DAY
          
          A lobster-bib kind of place. DAYTIME DRINKERS, MICKS in bad
          boat shoes, hyper-aware of... COSTELLO and BILLY in a back
          table. COSTELLO, having finished his lunch, is drawing. Billy
          is unused to being the subject of so many stares. He has sort
          of a coked-out nervousness, dirty hair.
          
                              BILLY
                    Don't look. There's a white van
                    across the parking lot?
          
          WE see it through the smeared glass: the WHITE VAN we always
          see. This time with a different magnetic business sign.
          
                              COSTELLO
                        (lifting and looking at
                         his sketch)
                    They don't have directional
                    microphones.
          
                              BILLY
                    What, do you got x-ray vision?
          
                              COSTELLO
                        (not taking his eyes off
                         his sketch)
                    They don't have directional
                    microphones.
          
          BILLY registers what seems to be inside information.
          COSTELLO looks over his half-glasses at Billy's untouched
          food. COSTELLO is sizing Billy up: has been thinking about
          him.
          
                               COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                    People looking at you make you self-
                    conscious?
          
          BILLY shrugs. Indicating: Yeah, well, who the fuck wouldn't
          be.
          
                              BILLY
                    I don't know.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    Why? They're minuses. They can't
                    tell the difference between a rock
                    star and a career criminal.
          
                              BILLY
                    Anyone not a criminal is a minus?

                       What are you soft? That's not what
                       I said. Eat something, Jesus
                       Christ, we got a nice day by the
                       water. Sun's shining, gulls are
                       up...Nice smell of ozone...
          
          TWO PRIESTS and a NUN are sitting two tables over. An older
          priest and a younger one. COSTELLO notices. THE NUN gets up
          and leaves.
          
                                 COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                       You know if your father were alive
                       and saw you, sitting here with me,
                       let's say he would have a word with
                       me about this, in fact, he'd kill
                       seven guys just to cut my throat.
                       And he could do it, which is
                       something you may not know about
                       William Costigan, Sr.
          
                                 BILLY
                       He never, ah, I mean never?
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       He kept his own counsel. He never
                       wanted money. You can't do a thing
                       with a man like that. Your uncle
                       Jackie needed a lot of money. But
                       even though he got his money from
                       me, he also would kill my entire
                       fucking family if he saw me here
                       with you. And I think about this.
          
                                 BILLY
                       So what are talking about here?
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       Fact is you're not a guy fresh from
                       the zoo who wants to run a spring
                       water distributor and I don't see
                       you up the dog track as a general
                       manager.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Look at it this way. It's like a
                       tuba. I want to see if I can get
                       something out of it.
          
          COSTELLO smiles at this, then looks at his sketch.

                              BILLY
                    With all due respect, Mr. Costello,
                    school's out.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    Well that's your problem. Maybe
                    someday you'll wake the fuck up.
          
          He gets up and leaves the table, leaving BILLY sitting there.
          COSTELLO stops to speak to the priests.

                    morning.
          
          The OLDER PRIEST is very nervous, looking around. The YOUNGER
          PRIEST concerned for his elder but personally not implicated.
          COSTELLO leans over the OLDER PRIEST, a pathetic man.

                    You recall our chat?

                         terrified)
                    "I am as God made me", was that
                    what you said? May I remind you,

                    that pride comes before the fall.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    What comes before the Fall is the
                    Summertime.
          
          COSTELLO notices that THE NUN is heading back to the table.

          OFFICE decorated with golf implements. ELLERBY has a

                    "Progress" is hard to define. I
                    make progress every day. In fact,
                    I'm making progress now. There are
                    guys in this department make
                    excellent progress for twenty years
                    without ever getting anything you
                    could definitively call a result.
                    It's like any American industry.
                    Nobody minds if you don't succeed
                    as long as you don't fuck up.

          INT. BILLY'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT. MORNING
          
          A stripped HOSPITAL BED stands in a fall of light. This is
          the apartment where his mother became ill. Billy has packed
          half of his mother's things into boxes--and then stopped.
          Billy doesn't use the bedroom. He sleeps on the couch among
          boxes of pictures, papers, teacups wrapped in newspaper.
          BILLY is sitting on the couch. He reaches into a box and lays
          out photographs like cards. Scenes from his life. His former
          life. His family life, his life as a child, his romantic
          life. He sits and stares at the pictures. He rearranges the
          photographs in different ways.
          
          NOTE: THIS IS A MEMORY BILLY HAS AS HE IS LOOKING AT
          PHOTOGRAPHS ON HIS MOTHER'S APARTMENT.
          
          FRENCH and BILLY break in, surprising the MAN (BRIAN), seated
          at his dining room table. He throws a child's toy at them.
          FRENCH ducks out of the way and the toy hits BILLY in the
          cheek.
          
          FRENCH draws his pistol and approaches the table. BRIAN
          rises and starts to flee. Cut off, he retreats the other
          way.
          
                                 BRIAN

          COLIN glances around and sees: a briefcase lying on a desk.

          The DRUGS are swept up instantly, in sheets laid over the

          then reaches out and lights the curtains on fire as BILLY
          watches.

                       It's all right. Guys tend to make
                       a big deal out of it. It's
                       actually quite common.

                       I gotta go to work.

                       People are liars. They want to be

                       That's an interesting observation.

                       Honesty isn't synonymous with
                       truth.

                    That's part of what I do. Although,
                    I don't normally see cadets who
                    were kicked out of the Academy.

                              MADOLYN
                    Sometimes they cry if they had
                    trouble at home or if they've had
                    to...use their weapons.
          
                              BILLY
                    Let me tell you something. They
                    signed up to use their fuckin'
                    weapons. Most of them. But they
                    watch enough TV so they know they
                    have to "weep" after they use their
                    weapons. No one's more full of shit
                    than a cop. Except a cop on TV.

          EXT. PLAZA OUTSIDE THE OFFICE BUILDING. DAY
          
          Very windy. Papers blowing. Billy is walking. Madolyn catches
          up to him.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    Why is the hardest patient of the
                    day always the last one?
          
                              BILLY
                    Because you're bored and tired and
                    don't give a shit. It's not
                    supernatural.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    Look, I'm not just...somebody you
                    have to see or they put you in
                    jail. If you are in distress I will
                    help you.
          
          Madolyn holds out a paper and a business card.
          
                              BILLY
                    What's this?
          
                              MADOLYN
                    My card. And a prescription for
                    twenty Lorazepam.
          
          BILLY stands holding the prescription.
          
                              BILLY
                    Is it enough to kill myself?
          
                              MADOLYN
                        (she fixes him with a
                         stare)
                    Maybe it is. All right? Have I done
                    my job up to your goddamned
                    standards? Because by my standards
                    you fit the model of drug-seeking
                    behavior, and fuck you if you don't
                    like my initial clinical reaction.

          It's an otherwise disused floor of a new luxury office
          building. Cables and monitors and computers everywhere. It's
          crawling with State Cops as well as FBI (LAZIO is present,
          very nattily dressed). COLIN comes in with BROWN and
          BARRIGAN. This operation is all new to Colin.

                           (addressing room)
                       Our target is a major transaction
                       of microprocessors. Yes, those. I
                       don't know what they are. You
                       don't know what they are. Who
                       gives a fuck? Cash will be handed
                       over in a building which we have
                       under AV surveillance. Staff

          COLIN wanders off in the mill of officers. He is taking out
          his cell phone when ELLERBY comes up to him.
          
                                 ELLERBY
                       Sorry to get you at the last

          COLIN joins his team (BROWN AND BARRIGAN), who are seated in
          a U shaped work-area. COLIN, still stunned by the fact of
          this operations center, swallows as he notices on video three
          angles of a building he seems to know very well. He sits down
          and puts a headset on. A GEEK COP leans over and shakes his
          hand.

          BILLY looks around at the pillared distances. He sees:
          
          A GROUP OF THREE MEN waiting and FIVE OTHER MEN spreading out
          through the pillars. Armed.

          COSTELLO'S BOYS spread out. Across the open, lumber-strewn
          area, CHINESE GANG MEMBERS are waiting.
          
          A LOCAL CHINESE-AMERICAN MAN acting as the interpreter and
          fixer stands waiting near a SUITCASE on the floor. With the
          CHINESE GANGSTERS is a more official looking MAN IN A BAD
          SUIT - terrified. FITZY carries a case containing the
          processors.

                              CHINESE TRANSLATOR
                    Tops, Mr. Costello. I want to tell
                    you that at least two of these
                    gents have machine guns.
          
          COSTELLO takes it all in. The CHINESE GANGSTER looks like a
          Malay pirate. Costello's gunmen are perched above, automatic
          weapons trained on the Triad.
          
          BILLY sneaks a message to Queenan via Text Message,"$" to
          indicate "buyers here."

                    Waiting, waiting. We almost
                    departed! This man is from the
                    Embassy. He will have to blow his
                    brains out if he is captured. His

          stops the departing Triad cars with a roadblock. As officers
          approach the cars they realize they are empty except for
          hired Caucasian drivers. An officer reports this to the
          command center.
          
          INT. COLIN'S APARTMENT. DAY
          
          Colin is asleep on the couch, in a bachelor disaster of
          Chinese food boxes. Something on TV: "Audition." A key in
          the door: He wakes as MADOLYN comes in carrying a bag of
          coffees and a BOX OF EFFECTS.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       Good Morning.
          
          MADOLYN smiles at him, also shy.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Good morning.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       I beat the movers.
          
                                 COLIN
                       How was the last night in the, ah,
                       old establishment?
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       (putting the box on the kitchen
                       counter)
                       Lonely.
          
                                  COLIN
                       I'm glad to hear that.   It sucked
                       here, too.
          
          They kiss.    MADOLYN takes in the apartment.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       I'm gonna thank your Uncle
                       Alphonsus for the square footage.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Uncle Alphonsus is in heaven.   So
                       am I.
          
          
                                                                   (CONTINUED)

          MADOLYN unpacks food.       Coffee.   Croissants.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       French donut?
          
                                 COLIN
                           (re: box of stuff)
                       Yeah. Hey, can I...
          
                                    MADOLYN
                       Sure yeah.
          
          He sorts through the box. It's all Madolyn's key stuff - a
          mug, a few critical books...framed family pictures,
          breakables...and comes up with: A PHOTOGRAPH of a young
          Madolyn standing in front of a North East rust belt slum.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Well, we're not having this out.
          
                                    MADOLYN
                       What?
          
          MADOLYN isn't prepared to be at cross-purposes. But she is
          taken aback. She puts the photo quietly away. Contaminated.
          
                                 COLIN
                       You don't see any pictures of where
                       I came from. Look, I respect who
                       you are, but not in the living
                       room. We might have company.
          
                                    MADOLYN
                       Company?
          
          She laughs.    COLIN looks at a diploma.     Veritas.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Why work for the state?
          
                                  MADOLYN
                       Why not?   You do.
          
                                  COLIN
                       Not forever, and you don't have to.
                       You've got degrees...you're a hot
                       shit... I mean, what you do, why
                       make as much as a guidance

          COLIN stares at her.
          
                              COLIN
                    Now you're just being ridiculous.

          THE PHONE (landline with mobile handset) rings.
          
                                 COLIN (CONT'D)
                    Answer it.     You live here.
          
          MADOLYN, not 100% confused by his seizing on the
          interruption, gets the phone.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    Mayor Sullivan's Office.
          
          After a moment she holds the receiver out to COLIN.
          
                               MADOLYN (CONT'D)
                        (whispering)
                    I'm sorry!

                              MADOLYN
                    I think it's a guy with a, ah,
                        (She touches her throat,
                         and whispers)
                    A cancer guy.
          
          COLIN reaches in his pocket and looks at his cellphone: dead.
          A bad mistake in his situation. He crams the phone into a
          table charger beside the landline and takes the handset.
          
                                 COLIN

                    Something for work.
          
          MADOLYN looks after him. She doesn't start eating again, she
          watches Colin. She is seen staring at him through the
          following scene.

                       There are certain things I will not
                       be able to talk to you about. I

          out fireworks to KIDS.

          BACK INSIDE:
          
          BILLY shoves him down on the couch and crams the gun to his
          head.
          
                                 BILLY
                       You take off an armored car at the
                       Dedham Mall and what do you do. Do
                       you pay guineas in Providence?
          
                                 BANKROBBER
                       Fucking now I do.
          
                                 BILLY
                       What the fuck do you do.
          
                                 BANKROBBER
                       What, I pay Costello and wait for
                       him to trade me to the FBI? Cause
                       that's what he does.
          
                                 BILLY
                       FBI? What the fuck are you talking
                       about.
          
          {Firecrackers off}
          
                                 BANKROBBER
                       Oh my God, is that French out
                       there?
          
                                 BILLY
                           (grabbing him by the
                            shirt)
                       What the fuck did you just say
                       about the FBI?
          
                                 BANKROBBER
                       Forget what I said. I'm fucking
                       high, I'm high.
          
          Firecrackers continue to go off outside. The BANKROBBER knows
          what this means.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Whatever's going through your very
                       poor, very limited, brain...I'm not
                       going to hurt you. Just tell me
                       what you just fucking said.

                              BANKROBBER
                    Forget it, I'm high, I must be
                    high, I would never say what you
                    thought I said.
          
          As the firecracker sounds increase outside (Maybe French's
          "Do what you have to do"), BILLY, no way out of what he has
          to do, glances at the window, shoots the guy through the
          kneecap. BLOOD sprays everywhere. The bankrobber screams.
          
                              BILLY
                    Tell me what the fuck you said.
          
                              BANKROBBER
                        (covered with blood)
                    Why do you think he's not arrested?
                    Costello's a protected FBI
                    informant. He'll trade you out.
                        (a beat)
                    I thought I was supposed to go into
                    shock. I'm not in shock. It fucking
                    hurts. It fucking hurts.
          
          BILLY gets out of the house.
          
          OUTSIDE
          
          MISTER FRENCH is benignly watching kids light cherry bombs.
          
                                BILLY
                    Let's go.
          
          ON SOUND: Sextet from LUCIA di LAMMAMOOR.
          
          INT. A THEATER. NIGHT
          
          From behind COSTELLO'S HEAD, which almost fills the frame, we
          see a blur of beautiful color. ON STAGE, an opera is in
          progress----LUCIA DI LAMMAMOOR done with masks. CUT TO
          COSTELLO, revealing Costello's rapt face and PAN to reveal on
          his Left a beautiful WHITE PROSTITUTE. PAN back over
          COSTELLO'S face to reveal a beautiful BLACK PROSTITUTE.
          PERFORMERS with MASKS sing on stage. As the music soars,
          COSTELLO moves crinolines up the women's legs.
          
          INT. A BEDROOM. NIGHT.
          
          COSTELLO fucks...and fucks weird.

          EXT. QUEENAN'S HOUSE IN WEST ROXBURY. NIGHT
          
          A street of three-deckers. QUEENAN gets out of his unmarked
          cruiser. As he does: BILLY steps out into the light. The two
          men stare at each other, each lit by their own streetlight.
          
                              BILLY
                    Hey, it's me.
          
                              QUEENAN
                    What do you want? What are you
                    doing here?
          
                                 BILLY
                    Come here.
          
          QUEENAN approaches him.
          
                              BILLY (CONT'D)
                    Costello is giving people up to the
                    FBI.
          
          QUEENAN stares.
          
                                 QUEENAN
                    The FBI?
          
                              BILLY
                    He gives information to the FBI.
                    He's a protected informant. Aren't
                    they trying to make it a Federal
                    case? And it never gets made?
          
                               QUEENAN
                        (realizing he has to be
                          very careful)
                    Go around the back. Go around the
                    back.
          
          INT. QUEENAN'S HOUSE. MOMENTS LATER
          
          BILLY sits on a bench in a hallway, exhausted, staring. THE
          SACRED HEART and JFK are on the walls. QUEENAN comes along
          the hall.
          
                              QUEENAN
                    My wife's asleep. She left supper
                    out. Come and have something to
                    eat.
          
          BILLY shakes his head.

                       We'll talk in the kitchen. Come and
                       have something to eat.
          
          BILLY follows him towards the lighted kitchen door.
          
          EXT. DRIVING RANGE. DAY (WINDY)
          
          COLIN is watching ELLERBY hit golf balls. Well.
          
                                 ELLERBY
                       Congratulations. Haven't seen a guy
                       like you since me. You'll be
                       transferred to Internal
                       Investigations but you will
                       continue to work right where you
                       are in the Special Investigation
                       Unit.
          
                                 COLIN
                       I don't get it.
          
                                 ELLERBY
                       We are all convinced that Costello
                       has at least one mole in the
                       Special Investigation Unit.
          
                                  COLIN
                       Right.
          
                                 ELLERBY
                       You'll investigate. Everybody.
                       Anybody.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Well, that's just a dream job for a
                       cop.
          
                                 ELLERBY
                       We have considered all possible
                       candidates. You have an immaculate
                       record. Some people never trust a
                       guy with an immaculate record. I
                       do.
                           (a beat)

                       Play golf?
          
                                    COLIN
                       No.
          
                                 ELLERBY
                       That's a pity. Pretty much sucks as
                       a game but you get to form
                       relationships.
                           (a beat)

                       Everything's great. On schedule.
                       She's a doctor.
          
                                 ELLERBY
                       Outstanding. That's good. Marriage
                       is an important part of getting
                       ahead. You don't want anyone
                       thinking you're a homo. Married guy
                       seems stable. People look at a
                       wedding ring and think: someone can
                       stand the son of a bitch. Ladies
                       see the wedding ring and know
                       immediately that you must have some
                       cash and that your cock works.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Oh, it's working. Overtime.
          
                                 ELLERBY

          EXT. CONSTRUCTION AREA. DAY
          
          HEAVY EQUIPMENT stands on the thrashed earth. Hoardings.
          BILLY crosses the road under what remains of the Expressway,
          and after hiding in an angle of the building and cocking the
          gun in his pocket bangs on the door of a dead bar. The door
          is unlocked by: DELAHUNT.
          
          INT. THE DEAD BAR. DAY
          
          It's another of COSTELLO'S "locations". BILLY looks around.
          Every man from the previous night is there--but no COSTELLO.
          DELAHUNT closes the door behind him and bars it. Men are
          oddly enough filling out forms. These are not men used to
          pencil and paper. Billy is nodded at.

                                 BILLY
                       I don't have a bank account.

                       No, I ain't.
          
          MISTER FRENCH goes off into a separate room. BILLY takes a
          paper and, sitting at the bar beside FITZY, writes down his
          information. The other men are mostly finished and DELAHUNT
          is collecting the papers. DELAHUNT tosses the brown envelope
          on the bar.
          
                                 DELAHUNT
                       Put the forms in there.
          
                                 FITZY
                       I don't know if this is how you
                       spell Citizens'.
          
          BILLY glances at what FITZY is crawling: CITTIZINS TRUST.
          
                                 BILLY
                       No, no, no. Jesus Christ.
          
          He takes the brown envelope, and writes on it CITIZENS.
          
                                 FITZY
                       What are you, retarded? That ain't
                       right.
          
          BILLY gives up. Both of their forms are stuffed in an
          envelope. BILLY gets up.
          
                                 DELAHUNT
                       Billy, he said to stay here.

                              BILLY
                    I'm not sitting in this room
                    without a tetanus shot. I'm not
                    staying.
          
                              MISTER FRENCH
                    Where you going?
          
          BILLY goes out. DELAHUNT puts his coat on. He picks up the
          brown envelope on which CITIZENS TRUST is written.
          
          EXT. THE WATERFRONT. DAY
          
          BILLY is holding his bottle of tranqs. He traces with his
          finger the doctor's name...MADOLYN MADDEN. His "police" phone
          vibrates and he takes it out.
          
                              ONSCREEN
                    Follow the envelope.
          
          BILLY deletes the IM and dials Queenan directly.
          
                              BILLY
                    Why can't Ellerby's guys? SIU.
          
          INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          QUEENAN closes his door.
          
                              QUEENAN
                    They can't. They are compromised.
          
          EXT. COSTELLO'S APARTMENT. NIGHT
          
          Costello emerges, in an overcoat. Carrying the envelope. He
          gets into his Oldsmobile. BILLY starts his car and follows.
          
          INT. CINEMA. NIGHT   REVISED ON SET 5/31/05
          
          Dark theater, movie in progress. Wobbly porno music. A thin
          audience of raincoat artists. The door opens and COSTELLO
          enters. He moves slowly down the aisle and sees: COLIN
          sitting alone. He sits down in front of COLIN.
          
          Costello is wearing the dildo.   He watches the movie,
          moaning.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    Oh yeah, be dirty.
          
          Colin goes for his gun.    Costello gets up, shows him the
          dildo.

                       See   anything you like?
          
          COLIN unnerved, recognizing COSTELLO now.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Jesus Christ, Frank, I almost shot
                       you.
          
          Frank sits, closer to Colin.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       You're not indulging in self abuse
                       are you?
          
                                 COLIN
                       Frank, we got problems.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       I hope you're not turning into one
                       of those sob sisters, who wants to
                       get caught. You're not crackin' up
                       are you?
          
                                 COLIN
                       I don't crack up.
          
                                  COSTELLO
                       Pick a place where any cop could
                       see you...

                       Why did you show up then?
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       I own the place.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Why am I not fuckin' surprised.
                       Look...
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       You're gettin' reassigned.

                                 COSTELLO

          COSTELLO chuckles, truly enjoying this.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    You're telling me, sonny boy.
          
                              COLIN
                    I have to find the guy you have in
                    the department.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    With everybody looking up their own
                    ass and you looking for yourself, I
                    put my money on nobody finding
                    nothing.
          
          We see in Colin's face hurt and hatred for Costello.   His
          idol doesn't like him.
          
                              COLIN
                    Frank, for me, you've got to lay
                    low.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    Laying low is not what I do.
          
                              COLIN
                    Yeah, big fuckin' daddy Frank.
                    Lookit, Frank, what good am I to
                    you if you don't listen to me?
                    Queenan's compartmentalizing. He's
                    fuckin' smart, you know that. I
                    will find this rat if you let me do
                    it my way. If you let me do my job.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    Okay.
                        (gives him the envelope)
                    But Colin, I hope I won't have to
                    remind you, that if you don't find
                    that cheese eating rat bastard in
                    your department so we can give him
                    a halo, most likely it won't be me
                    who pays for it.
          
          COLIN nods, sweat on his lip.
          
                              COLIN
                    Why would you need to remind me of
                    that? I didn't know that would I
                    be any good at what I do? Trust
                    me, I know how to do this.

                    It involves lying, and I'm pretty
                    fucking good at that, right?
          
                              COSTELLO
                        (looking at the screen)
                    Maybe it's because it's always been
                    so easy for me to get cunt that I
                    never understood jerking off in a
                    theatre.
          
          Costello gets up to go.
          
                              COSTELLO (CONT'D)
                    Who knows what's easy? Collie,
                    take care of business.
          
          The door opens again at the back of the theater and we see:
          BILLY in a dark back seat. COSTELLO, after hesitating as
          Colin sweats, shoves the brown envelope to COLIN, and goes.
          
          BILLY receives a text message: "Get visual ID suspect." He
          slumps in his seat as Costello marches up the aisle and out
          of the theater. He has barely recovered from this when:
          
          The dark shape of COLIN is moving rapidly towards and through
          the emergency exit beside the screen.
          
          Billy follows.
          
          INT. CINEMA BACK STAIRCASE AND ALLEY. NIGHT
          
          It's open, and gives on to what Boston keeps trying to call
          the Theater District and what keeps being The Combat Zone.
          COLIN vanishes around a corner. BILLY follows, looks left and
          right, then goes after
          
          EXT. A STREET OF CHINESE SHOPS. CONTINUOUS
          
          COLIN, who is walking along, putting the envelope into his
          coat.
          
          BILLY is speeding up, moving through pedestrians, desperate
          to see Colin's face.
          
          COLIN will be caught up to within seconds. He turns down
          another street. BILLY starts into a half-run. He turns the
          corner.
          
          ANOTHER STREET painted with neon light (quiet).
          
          BILLY'S POV:
          
          COLIN is halfway down the street.

          BILLY follows.
          
          BILLY is nearly up to COLIN on this quieter street
          
          (And COLIN is aware of the tail)
          
          when...
          
          BILLY'S cellphone rings. His phone has fucked up, as they
          do. Instead of turning around, COLIN accelerates. The only
          thing on his agenda is to not have his face seen.
          
          BILLY spins into a door-opening and silences the ringer.
          
                                 TEXT MESSAGE DETAIL
                       Make arrest.
          
          COLIN takes a right at the end of the street, into an alley.
          
          EXT. AROUND THE NEXT CORNER. MOMENTS LATER
          
          COLIN is waiting, in a doorway of his own. He has a knife
          open in his hand. He waits, listening to (faltering)
          footsteps: a MAN, face invisible in shadow, turns the corner.
          COLIN pulls him into the doorway and rips upwards with a
          knife.
          
          As the body falls we see: it isn't Billy. It's a CHINESE MAN.
          COLIN backs away in horror, and hurries off down the street.
          
          EXT. ANOTHER STREET. MOMENTS LATER
          
          COLIN, sweating, staggering, hurries along. No sign of Billy,
          no sign of a follower. But he does notice: CCTV cameras at
          the intersection. He spins and gets out of there, heading off
          through. CHINATOWN. Colin, holding his envelope, walks,
          sweating, fast, then faster, past repeated ideograms in neon
          (the ideograms say--flash--"Departed").
          
          EXT. CHINATOWN. MOMENTS LATER
          
          BILLY has lost Colin. He hears a hubbub from the corner where
          a small crowd of Chinese speakers is gathering and pushes
          through the crowd to see: blood running on the pavement.
          BILLY backs away, gets out of there.
          
          INT. CCTV ROOM. NIGHT
          
          COLIN is looking at CCTV tapes. We see COLIN, unrecognizable
          on cheap video. Then we see a blurred image of BILLY.
          Crossing the street in beats. No more use as ID than the
          Shroud of Turin.
          
                                                                 102.
          
          
          
          EXT. MADOLYN'S CELLAR APARTMENT. NIGHT (RAINING)
          
          Through grated windows we can see Madolyn finishing up her
          packing. BILLY KNOCKS on the door, which leads only into
          Madolyn's basement apartment. A long beat and she opens the
          door. The chain on.
          
                              BILLY

                    Are you okay? Why are you here?
          
                              BILLY
                    I really liked our conversations.
                    I've been...regretting that we
                    didn't continue...our
                    conversations.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    I'm glad you want to see me...it's
                    nice to see you...I enjoyed
                    talking...I enjoyed having coffee
                    with you, very much...but I don't
                    see people...I don't see people in
                    my home.

          INT. MADOLYN'S CELLAR APARTMENT. CONTINUOUS
          
          BILLY looks around and sees: boxes, transition. The furniture
          already gone. An air-mattress on the floor. There are still
          tea things on the counter. A basic life is still possible
          here. Madolyn has been making tea here, sleeping here,
          reading in bed. Billy, soaked, a drowned rat, is looking
          vulnerable and honest.
          
                              BILLY
                    Thanks. If this is inappropriate...
                    I can leave.
          
          MADOLYN takes a moment to react.

          BILLY is looking at THE PICTURE to which Colin objected. A
          young girl in front of a rust belt slum, tilted in a box of
          effects.
          
                                    MADOLYN (CONT'D)

                                 BILLY
                       Yeah, I know.
          
          He hangs the picture on a nail.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                           (the kettle whistles OS)
                       Would you like a cup of tea?
          
          BILLY nods.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Yeah. Yeah I would. Thank you.
          
          Madolyn leaves him looking vaguely around the apartment. In
          the kitchen, it appears that Madolyn has forgotten how to
          make a cup of tea. She perseveres, comes out holding two
          cups. Billy is looking at the handful of books still in the
          apartment.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       Do you want some...
          
                                  BILLY
                       Sugar?   No...
          
          She hands him the cup of tea. Strung out, he spills his tea,
          slightly, unobserved by Madolyn. Madolyn looks over at the
          bed, the book, the lamp, the incontrovertible evidence that
          she's probably really, in fact, not that into Colin..

          INT. MADOLYN'S BASEMENT APARTMENT. NIGHT
          
          In the tiny kitchen BILLY is kissing MADOLYN and unbuttoning
          her shirt. Her hands start to move to push him away. He
          continues.
          
                                                                 105.

          Still studying the blurry image of Billy, COLIN tenses as
          someone comes into the office and switches off the tape. He
          glances at his coat. The envelope is visible folded into the
          breast pocket. He takes his coat and goes.
          
          EXT. CHARLES STREET. NIGHT
          
          Wet empty streets. The "gaslights" are on. About midnight.
          
          INT. CHARLES STREET BRASSERIE. NIGHT
          
          A Costello business. The restaurant is closed for the night.
          One bartender is sweeping up and the other is counting the
          takings. In a darker alcove of the bar COSTELLO sits alone at
          a broad table, drinking brandy. On sound, classical music. As
          a knocking is heard Costello looks up. A BARTENDER lets Billy
          in. COSTELLO watches Billy approach. We hear him sit down.
          
                              COSTELLO
                    You got a girlfriend?
          
                                BILLY
                    No.   No.   What does that matter?
          
                              COSTELLO
                    Depends. I'm sure you know by now
                    there's an informer in my crew.
                    Cop. Staties or Boston Police
                    department, I'm not sure.
          
          He pours Billy some brandy. Then starts to draw a sketch.
          
                              BILLY
                    What about the FBI.

                    an old friend or stupid...that's

                       They're all murderers right? I
                       think "could I do murder?" And all
                       I can answer myself is, "what's the

                       Yeah, that's my point. You accuse
                       me once, I put up with it. You
                       accuse me twice, I quit. If you
                       make me fear for my life, I put a
                       fucking bullet in your head as if
                       you were anybody else.
          
          COSTELLO looks up. This is new: but he's impassive. And
          impressed.

                    I probably could be you. I know
                    that much. But I don't want to be
                    you.

          Internal Investigations. COLIN'S moving through the bullpen.
          COPS stare at him with resentment.

                       The day you wouldn't take a
                       promotion, you let me know. And I
                       wouldn't even have a job if you did
                       yours.

                              QUEENAN
                    What do you expect? Everybody
                    knows you're assigned here to find
                    Costello's rat. They want to find
                    the leak as much as you do. What
                    they do not want is to be accused
                    of being the rat.
          
          COLIN sits uneasily.
          
                              COLIN

                    can go over my head, high as you

          INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. DAY
          
          COLIN is sitting in his office alone, remembering what
          Queenan has just told him:
          
                                 QUEENAN (V.O.)
                       Follow Costello and you'll find his
                       informer.
          
          In the fishbowl of his glass office, COLIN is being stared at
          by pissed-off cops. COLIN calms down. He opens the gray
          envelope. He takes out the forms that he was given by
          Costello, opens up POLICE PERSONNEL DATABASE and starts
          searching. He types in SS numbers. One, then another, then
          another. The result is always: "Person not found". He types
          in Costigan, William M, hits return. It comes up: "Person not
          found". COLIN keeps working.
          
                                                                   112.

          images he saw on the CCTV screen (which he has printed
          out).COLIN closes the curtains on his fishbowl office (not
          fast enough to avoid seeing Dignam give him the finger),
          locks his door. He picks up the phone.

                    city...I'm thinking that.
          
          Another city doesn't seem unattractive to Madolyn, who's in
          her own cut-and-run crisis -- but maybe she can't believe
          that Colin is thinking about it. She blows a breath.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    Another city? It'd be a clean

          FITZY and DELAHUNT are smoking on the sidewalk outside the
          restaurant.
          
                                 DELAHUNT
                       Of course I know how to spot a cop.
          
                                 FITZY
                       Oh yeah, how's that?
          
                                 DELAHUNT
                       If he's not paying attention to us,
                       he's a cop.
          
          THEIR POV:
          
          A MAN across the street is looking into the window of an
          antique shop.
          
                                 DELAHUNT (CONT'D)
                       See that guy over there, he's a
                       cop. He's not paying attention to
                       us. He's a cop.
          
                                 FITZY
                       Lot of fucking cops.
          
          A WOMAN walks by definitely ignoring both men, dragging a
          lapdog.
          
                                 FITZY (CONT'D)
                       What kind of dog is that?
          
          No response.

          Too early to be opened for business. COSTELLO and NEW GUYS,
          six hard customers, come in through the fire door. At the
          BAR, BILLY is drinking coffee. He notices the NEW GUYS. Off
          the boat Dublin toughs. COSTELLO and FRENCH come in from the
          kitchen. FRENCH tells the NEW GUYS to move to the back.
          COSTELLO HAS BLOOD ON HIS SLEEVES. He comes over to the bar
          and looks at BILLY.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       You can get out of here.   This is
                       the crew for tonight.
          
                                 BILLY
                       I thought I was on for that.
          
                                  COSTELLO
                       I changed my mind. Take the night
                       off.
                            (to Bartender)
                       Jimmy, get the mop.
          
          COSTELLO heads to the back of the restaurant. MISTER FRENCH,
          grabs the BAR KNIFE from behind the bar. BILLY looks up at
          him.
          
                                 MISTER FRENCH
                       Go out the back. Some guys answer
                       the questions right. Some don't.
          
          MISTER FRENCH goes towards the back of the restaurant,
          holding the big knife. BILLY closes his paper.

                       We're guessing who cops are. Most
                       good looking women are cops.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Right. I'm going home. He's playing

          Queenan. On foot. A plug in his ear. Two other DETECTIVES sit
          in a sedan nearby. (These three detectives are new guys,
          never seen before, the I.I. surveillance team working for

                    He's crazy. I just saw the man.
                    He had blood all over him. I can't
                    get any more information for you.
                    I can't trust it. He's not
                    including his regular guys... I'm
                    telling you, he's gonna find out
                    who I am. He's gonna fuckin' kill
                    me, I know it.

                    All right, all right. I hear you.
                    I'm sorry for you trouble. Look,
                    I'm not gonna jeopardize your
                    safety any longer. I'll get you
                    out. I can't do it overnight but
                    I'll do it. We can bust him for
                    what we have. At least I think we

                       other guys is a rat, would I take
                       him out. I told him I would but I
                       don't know if I would. Now I know I
                       can't. I've done a lot of bad
                       things but I've never been a
                       murderer.
          
          BILLY realizes that DELAHUNT is dying.
          
                                 DELAHUNT (CONT'D)
                       Hey Billy, I don't want no one to
                       put me in a dumpster. Just don't
                       put me in a dumpster.
          
                                 BILLY
                       When you're dead it makes no
                       difference where they put you.
          
          BILLY lights him a cigarette.
          
                                 DELAHUNT
                       You know what I thought today?
          
                                 BILLY
                       What's that?
          
                                 DELAHUNT
                       Who didn't show up today is the
                       rat.
          
                                   BILLY
                       Yeah, so?
          
                                  DELAHUNT
                       You never been late in your life.
                       And when I called you... I made a
                       mistake. I gave you the wrong
                       address. But you showed up at the
                       right one.
          
          DELAHUNT grips his arm. BILLY is terrified.
          
                                 DELAHUNT (CONT'D)
                       Tell me why I didn't say anything.

          He waits for DELAHUNT to continue. But DELAHUNT after an odd
          smile of complicity, finally dies. BILLY, the only one who
          knows that DELAHUNT is dead, stares down at him.

                    excessive with the cop.
          
          BILLY walks past the table.

                    He's dead. I'm going home.
          
          BILLY leaves by the front door.
          
          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM. NIGHT
          
          All hands present. Dignam is in a black silent rage.

                    Do you know why Queenan went to

                    A better question is why your
                    fuckers were following him.
          
                              COLIN
                    I told Internal Investigations to
                    follow him.
          
                              DIGNAM
                    Why?
          
                              COLIN
                    That's internal Investigations
                    business.
          
          DIGNAM grabs COLIN by the neck and runs him into a wall.
          COLIN gets a palm under Dignam's chin and comes close to
          breaking his neck. The men at length are separated. COLIN
          straightens his good clothes.
          
                              COLIN (CONT'D)

          DIGNAM hits COLIN in the face. COLIN goes down hard, into the
          crook of a file cabinet and the wall. Blood from his mouth.
          
                                 DIGNAM

          stunned. Queenan's number! He picks up the call but remains
          silent. The caller is also doing the same.

          COLIN hears that the other side has hung up the phone. He
          sees: ELLERBY looking at him through the glass. But Ellerby
          hasn't seen the phone.

          BILLY is agitated. Exhausted. Frightened. He paces, and looks
          at the phone. He begins to pack, assembling clothes, money.
          Finally, like a man committing suicide--it's that intense--
          he dials the number. INTERCUT.
          
                              COLIN
                    Yeah.

                    You called this number on a dead

                       Were you in the fuckin' car?
          
                                 BILLY
                       What if they took one off and put
                       another one on, Frank?
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       Load.
          
          The drugs having been loaded fast by the crew, including
          FNG's, the container is hosed out. BILLY turns from FITZY'S
          CAR as everyone gets it.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Frank told me to check out the
                       back. You guys go ahead.
          
                                 FNG DENNIS
                       Watch your ass.
          
          Instead of getting into COSTELLO'S CAR on the other side of
          the container, he steps back into shadows as both cars leave.
          
          INT. COSTELLO'S CAR. NIGHT
          
          FOUR CARS with no headlights bracket the vehicles as soon as
          they come out of the garage. COSTELLO realizes that something
          has gone wrong.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       Cocksucker.
          
          LIGHTS come on, and Policemen are everywhere, guns in their
          hands. COLIN is not visible among them.
          
          POLICE open fire at Costello's car. THE CAR reverses back
          into the garage. MISTER FRENCH (the driver) is shot in the
          arm, and the car crashes into a wall. A gunfight opens up.
          FNG's exchange fire with brutally efficient tactical cops and
          are shot down expertly. COSTELLO, limping, gets out of the
          action, fast. He runs into the parking garage. French drives
          away (alternately is shot, or commits suicide).
          
          INT. PARKING GARAGE. NIGHT
          
          COSTELLO, shot through the stomach, is moving through the
          dark. All that's stored in this garage is heavy equipment for
          the big dig. Plenty of places to hide. We hear gunfire in the
          distance. COSTELLO hides between two pieces of heavy
          equipment and dials his telephone. To his surprise the phone
          rings quite nearby. And keeps ringing.

          COSTELLO moves out into the open, and sees, at a near
          distance, COLIN, his shadow long on the concrete. He has a
          gun in his hand. Costello moves out to face him.
          
                                 COLIN
                       You're an FBI informant.
          
          COSTELLO comes out of the shadows.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       Jesus Colin, grow up. Course I'm
                       talking to the FBI.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Do they know who I am?
          
          COSTELLO says nothing for a moment.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       I never gave up anybody who wasn't
                       goin' down anyway.
          
          COLIN instantly raises the pistol to shoot him.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Did you give me up?
          
          COLIN'S PISTOL wavers.
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       Nobody knows nothin'.
          
          COLIN shakes his head and cocks the gun.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Frank, Frank, do they know about
                       me?
          
                                 COSTELLO
                       I know you, Colin. You know I'd
                       never give you up. You're like...
          
                                 COLIN
                       A son...to you? Is that what it is
                       about, all that murderin' and
                       fuckin' and no sons? What are you,
                       shooting blanks?
          
          COSTELLO tries to raise his gun which is inside his sleeve.
          He's sitting on his coat so that the shot goes off sideways
          as COLIN shoots him.

          COSTELLO topples backward into the bucket of the bucket
          loader.
          
          ANGLE ON COLIN.
          
          Then from the bucket loader, a post death tremor sets off one
          last shot from COSTELLO'S gun. Ricochet. COLIN fires into the
          dead body again and again. He backs away.
          
                              COLIN (CONT'D)
                    I got Costello! I got Costello

          INT. POLICE HQ/CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Colin is debriefed concerning the shooting of Costello.
          [Dialog separate document].
          
          INT. BULLPEN AREA. DAY
          
          COLIN enters, tired from a debriefing. Applause from everyone
          in the office--the full crew. COLIN is embarrassed by the
          attention. BROWN is leading the whole team to a standing
          ovation. COLIN looks past the heads of the crowd and sees:
          Dignam, staring at him evenly.
          
                              COLIN
                        (to crowd)
                    It's not any reason for, ah...
          
          QUEENAN'S SECRETARY brings him some wine.
          
                                 COLIN (CONT'D)
                    Thank you.
          
                              QUEENAN'S SECRETARY
                    No, thank you.
          
          He takes a glass of wine. Then guiltily, almost in tears, he
          drinks. BROWN jerks a thumb towards Colin's office #2.
          
                              BROWN
                    He's waited a long time for you.
                        (COLIN looks up and sees
                         BILLY)
                    How'd you get him without the
                    files?

                       Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the
                       phone. How long have you been

                                 COLIN
                       I can't begin to tell you what a
                       debt we owe you. I want you to
                       know I'll be recommending you for

          INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MADOLYN'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          BILLY waits outside Madolyn's office.
          
          MADOLYN, carrying work, breakfast, rounds the corner and sees
          him standing and waiting for her. She's a little spooked,
          opens her mouth to speak...
          
                              BILLY
                    I know. I'm not here to...I'm not
                    here for that. I've got something
                    to...to give to you...something I
                    need you to keep. For me.
          
                              MADOLYN
                    What is it?

                           (stopping her from
                            speaking)
                       I need you to be my friend here and
                       not ask any questions. That's for
                       you to hold.
          
          He gives her a manila envelope.
          
                                 BILLY (CONT'D)
                       Only you. Open this if I'm dead or
                       if I call you and tell you to open
                       it. Please do exactly what it
                       says. Exactly what it says,
                       please.
          
          Madolyn is a friend. She's not going to ask questions.           She
          accepts the envelope.
          
                                    MADOLYN
                       All right.
          
                                 BILLY
                       I'm sorry to show up here like
                       this. There was no one else I
                       could give it to. I'm sorry.
                       There was no one else.
          
          He backs away, and then turns to go.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       I...we...
                           (he turns)
                       I've, it's, been so confused... I
                       just want to say...
          
          He turns and looks at her.          She doesn't speak: can't.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Whatever you have to say, really
                       think about it, and if you still
                       want to tell me, tell me in two
                       weeks, all right?
          
          She moves her head slightly, watches him go.

          MADOLYN sits at her desk, devastated, looking at a fall of
          light. The envelope lies on her blotter. She sits on ...
          then straightens up, takes a marker and writes "COSTIGAN" on
          the envelope and puts it in her desk drawer.

          INT. COLIN'S APARTMENT. MORNING
          
          A SONOGRAM picture of a fetus. It looks to him at first like
          a CCTV picture blown up. COLIN stares as if at something in a
          horror film.
          
                                 COLIN
                       I was dreaming...
          
                                 MADOLYN

                                 COLIN
                       I was dreaming I was dead.
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       Death is hard. Life is much
                       easier.

          He does.

                                 MADOLYN

                                 COLIN
                       You're joking...
          
                                 MADOLYN
                       It's not a joke, it's a human
                       being.
          
          Colin belatedly thinks of what a human being might do in
          these circumstances and kisses her.

          INT COLIN'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          COLIN is in the shower. MADOLYN moves into the     kitchen and
          puts the kettle on. She checks the mail, lying     there on the
          counter. It's tied with a string. She undoes       the string and
          sorts through the mail. Suddenly, she freezes      looking at:
          
          AN OVERSIZED ENVELOPE addressed to COLIN: [COLIN SULLIVAN, 20
          Pickering Street, Apt TK, Boston, MA, zip TK], with a return
          address of Wm. Costigan, 13 Conant St., Boston, etc., etc.]
          
          MADOLYN stares at the envelope, listening to the shower
          going. Billy has written to her fiance. She starts to put
          the envelope down, and then realizes...she has to hide
          it...she has to open it.
          
          Inside the envelope is a jewel case: EXILE ON MAIN STREET.
          And a note: PLAY ME NOW. MADOLYN puts the CD into the
          machine. She puts on the headset and listens...and listens.
          
          COLIN comes out of the bathroom, dressed in jeans and t-
          shirt, barefoot, his hair wet. He looks at Madolyn,
          realizing that something is wrong.
          
                                 COLIN
                       What?
          
          MADOLYN pulls the headphone jack out of the stereo and
          roughly the following booms out of the speakers. [NOTE: THIS
          RECORDING WAS DONE IN POST -- I THINK FROM THE PORN THEATRE

                       It tends to be the other guy.
          
          COLIN stares at her and we ought to think murder is a
          possibility.

                    Costello recorded everything. He
                    put all the tapes in a little box
                    and kept them with his lawyer. That
                    was his insurance. His lawyer came
                    to me. Costello trusted me the
                    most. Imagine that you rat fuck.
                    Sound quality good enough? I was a

          COLIN looks out through the door, no gun drawn, but very much
          a cop clearing his corners. He steps out and--BILLY takes him
          from behind the door, his only blind side, and grabs the back
          of his collar and crams a pistol into the bottom of his
          skull.

          BILLY turns Colin around and puts the pistol to Colin's
          forehead, hard enough to break the skin. He takes out Colin's
          belt gun and puts it in his pocket. (Billy screams "hands!"
          at Colin every time he makes a move).

                       You didn't come here to talk, you
                       fuckin' maggot, you came here to
                       get arrested.
          
                                 COLIN
                       Arrested? Arrested for what.
                           (as BILLY cuffs him)
                       So you got tapes of what? Costello
                       was my informant. I was his rat?
                       Fuck you. Prove it. I say he was
                       my informant.

                       What is this, a citizen's arrest?
                       Blow me, prick. Only one of us is
                       a cop, here, Bill. Nobody knows who
                       you are. Nobody knows who you are.
          
                                 BILLY
                       Would you shut the fuck up.
          
                                 COLIN
                       I'm a sergeant in the Mass. State
                       Police. Who the fuck are you?
                       Nobody. I ERASED YOU.
          
          BILLY puts the gun to Colin's head.

                       See what happens.

                        (safeties the gun)
                    I'm arresting you.

          COLIN is hammered to his knees. Head down, blood in his
          hair, drooling blood, thinking (impossibly) about his next
          move. He seems to realize he's fucked.
          
                              BILLY (CONT'D)
                    [You are what you do.] Get up.
                        (COLIN doesn't move.)
                    I said get the fuck up.
          
          BILLY grabs the back of Colin's collar and puts the gun to
          Colin's head. A crunch of gravel, off. BILLY and COLIN both
          hear it.
          
                              BROWN

          BILLY drags COLIN to his feet and using Colin as a shield
          aims the pistol at: BROWN. Brown is aiming his weapon.
          
                              BILLY
                    I called you. You specifically.

                    Maybe you do, but right now I need
                    you to drop the weapon.

          The doors open and for a frozen moment BILLY, holding the gun
          on COLIN, stares out of the car. A LOUD BANG. BILLY is shot
          through the head. BLOOD sprays the walls, and COLIN is hit by
          flying blood and matter. BILLY falls, crumpled, on his face,
          half in and half out of the elevator. The doors try to
          close...open...COLIN, covered with blood, looks up.
          
          BARRIGAN lowers his pistol.
          
          COLIN slumps, covered with blood. BARRIGAN uncuffs him. COLIN
          feels his wrists. BARRIGAN picks up BILLY'S gun. The other
          elevator doors open and BROWN emerges. He looks into the
          bloody elevator and down at the dead man.

                       Did you think you were the only one
                       he had? Costello was going to sell
                       us to the FBI. It's you and me now.
                       We have to take care of each other.

                       I now understand to have been
                       Francis Costello's informer in SIU,
                       intercepted us in the lobby and
                       shot Trooper William Costigan once
                       in the head.
                           (drinks water)
                       At that time Barrigan retrieved
                       Trooper Costigan's undercover
                       weapon and shot Trooper Brown as he
                       was approaching our location. I
                       attempted to subdue Trooper
                       Barrigan and in the ensuing
                       struggle was struck several times
                       with the Walther pistol. I was
                       able to wrestle the weapon away, at
                       which time Barrigan drew his own
                       weapon and took aim at me. I was
                       able to get off a single shot,
                       striking Barrigan in the head. I
                       then checked for vital signs of
                       Troopers Brown and Costigan and
                       discovered that they had expired.

          COLIN has a bag of expensive groceries and wine. Living the
          Beacon Hill dream. He climbs the steps slowly. He nods to a
          neighbor, an old lady coming down with her dog (who
          incidentally will never accept him as a neighbor, and COLIN
          briefly seems aware of this). (Don't be afraid to get a bit
          French here). He gets to his door, and starts to cry, and
          nearly crumples. But he gets the door open. He looks up and
          sees a gun. Behind it, stepping fast out of the shadows,
          DIGNAM. Avenging a guy he didn't even like, because it's the
          right thing to do. COLIN looks down and sees that Dignam has
          plastic hospital boots on his feet.
          
                                   COLIN

                       OK.
          
          DIGNAM fires. Flash groceries fall all over the floor.
          DIGNAM'S FEET step over COLIN's body, crushing one of a half
          dozen croissants, and DIGNAM goes down the expensive
          staircase, leaving the door to the apartment open. The
          strangest thing happens: a rat emerges and begins to eat the
          dead man's croissants. The rat hears something and runs so
          it's not in the shot when it
          
          FREEZES.

                                      The world is a fine place,
                                      and worth fighting for.

                                              1940







     EXT.  COUNTRY CHURCH -- DAY

     The white cross on the church steeple stands against blue sky.
     The church bell rings, resonating.

     Mass has let out.  Small church, small congregation.  The dirt
     road in front is lined with pick-up trucks and parishioners on
     foot heading to outlying farms and homes.  An old two-story
     house sits across the road.  Lone.

     INT.  OLD HOUSE -- DAY

     Sunlight comes through the soot on the windows, more brown than
     bright.  SOMERSET, 45, in a suit and tie, stands in this empty
     second-story room.  He looks around, at the ceiling, at the worn
     wooden floor, at the peeling wallpaper on the walls.

     Somerset walks to one wall where the current wallpaper is peeled
     away to reveal flowery wallpaper underneath.  He runs his finger
     across one of the pale red roses that decorates the older paper.
     He pushes the grime away, brings the rose out more clearly.

     He pulls at the edge of the paper, carefully ripping off a
     roughly squared section with the rose at its center.

     He studies it in his hand.

     EXT.  OLD HOUSE -- DAY

     Birds sing.  Somerset stands, pondering the forested landscape.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                   Is something wrong?

     Somerset does not respond. The MAN, in an ill-fitting real
     estate jacket, is seated on the hood of a dirty Ford
     Thunderbird.  He holds a check and a booklet of receipts.

                                 MAN (CONT)
                   Is something the matter?

                                 SOMERSET
                   No... no.  There's nothing wrong.

     Somerset still seems distant.

                                 MAN
                           (writes receipt)
                   Not that it's any of my business... but,
                   are you figuring on moving out here
                   eventually?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Soon.

                                 MAN
                   I just never seen a man mortgaging an
                   empty house before.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Everything here still seems... seems so
                   strange to me.  All this.

                                 MAN
                   I don't know.  I'd say this place is
                   about as normal as places get.

     The man walks over to hand over a receipt.  Somerset accepts the
     receipt, folds it.  Somerset smiles.

                                 SOMERSET
                   That is exactly what I mean.  Strange.

     Somerset looks back at the house.  The man does not understand.


     INT.  AMTRACK TRAIN -- DAY -- (CREDIT SEQUENCE BEGINS)

     Somerset is in a window seat, smoking a cigarette, looking out
     the speeding train.  He is near the back of the car, away from
     the few other passengers.

     Outside, farms, small homes and lawns pass.  The entire panorama
     is dappled by the rays of the soon setting sun.

     The light flickers across Somerset's placid face.

     INT.  AMTRACK TRAIN -- LATER DAY

     The train is nearly full.  Somerset has his suitcase on the
     aisle seat beside him.  He has a hardcover book unopened on his
     lap.  He still stares out the window, but his disposition has
     soured.  The train is passing an ugly, swampy field.

     A car's burnt-out skeleton sits rusting in the bracken.  A little
     further on, two dogs are fighting, circling, attacking, their
     coats matted with blood.

     Somerset turns his head to watch the dogs.

     Away in the field, another dog sprints to join the fight.

     INT.  AMTRACK TRAIN -- EARLY EVENING

     Passing urban streets below.  Slums.  Smashed cars.  People
     stand on the corners, under the bleak glow of street lamps.

     Somerset's suitcase is by the window.  Somerset is now in the
     aisle seat, reading his book.


     INT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT -- LATER NIGHT -- (END CREDITS)

     Curtains closed.  The SOUNDS of the CITY are here as they will
     be everywhere in this story.  A CAR ALARM SHRIEKS.  Somerset's
     life is packed in many moving boxes, except for clothing in a
     closet and hundreds of books on shelves.

     Somerset, dressed only in his underwear, lays back on the bed.
     He reaches to the nightstand, to a wooden, pyramidical
     metronome.

     He frees the metronome's weighted swingarm so it moves back and
     forth.  Swings to the left... TICK, swings to the right... TICK.
     Tick, tick, tick, measured and steady.

     Somerset situates on the bed, closes his eyes.  The metronome's
     ticking competes with the sound of the car alarm.  Somerset's
     face tightens as he concentrates on the metronome.

     His eyes close tighter.

     Tick, tick, tick... the swingarm moves evenly.  Somerset's
     breathing deepens.  The car ALARM seems QUIETER.

     Tick, tick, tick.  Somerset continues his concentration.

     The METRONOME is the ONLY SOUND.  Somerset's face relaxes
     slightly as he begins to fall asleep.  Tick, tick, tick...


     EXT.  CHINESE BODEGA/CITY STREETS -- NIGHT

     DAVID MILLS, 31, exits with a bagged 40oz bottle of beer.  He is
     a lean, attractive man, constantly coiled, eyes always
     smoldering.  FOLLOW as he walks quickly past iron-gated
     storefronts.  He crosses the street under elevated subway
     tracks.  A train roars overhead.

     Mills watches it as he walks on.

     Blue sparks spit off the third rail and illuminate Mills,
     throwing his shadow long down the deserted street.

     EXT.  URBAN STREET OF ROW HOMES -- NIGHT

     This rotting neighborhood lives in the shadow of a single fat
     skyscraper.  Mills walks, looks at the broken refrigerators and
     pieces of junk in the gutter.

     Ahead in the street, TWO YOUNG THUGS struggle with a crowbar to
     break into the trunk of a parked car.

     Mills draws near.  One thug looks up, doesn't think Mills will
     be a problem, continues prying.  Mills stops, calm.

                                 MILLS
                   Is that your car, man?

                                 FIRST THUG
                   What the fuck do you care?

     Mills pauses, switches his beer bottle to his other hand.

                                 MILLS
                   Does that car belong to you?

     The thugs look at each other, gauging.  They face Mills.

                                 FIRST THUG
                   Yeah, it's my car, alright?  Fuck off.

                                 MILLS
                   You're telling me that's your car?

     The second thug starts the long way round the car.

                                 SECOND THUG
                   Well, for some strange reason, I don't
                   believe you.

     Mills gives a "isn't that silly" laugh, shifts his gaze --

     Sees the first thug slide the crowbar so it's held as a weapon.

                                 FIRST THUG
                           (steps forward)
                   You can fucking suck my...

     Mills swiftly finishes that sentence by smashing his bottle
     against the first thug's head.  The thug falls, swings blindly.

     The second thug moves from the side, brings out a knife.

     Mills averts, swings, pounds the side of his fist into the
     second thug's face -- CRACK.  Broken nose.

     The second thug stumbles back, drops the knife, his nose
     squirting blood.

     Mills turns, enraged, breathing hard.

     The first thug is screaming, trying to stand.  Mills takes one
     step, punts the first thug's head.  The crowbar clatters away.

     Mills is in the process of kicking a man when he's down, when
     the second thug grabs him from behind, pulls him backwards.

     Mills clutches at the thug's arm, trying to avoid a choke-hold.
     They both struggle spastically.  The thug's winning.

     Gurgling, gasping for air, Mills shifts his weight, drops to one
     knee and spins the thug, slamming him against the car.

     Mills breaks loose, grabs a handful of the second thug's hair
     and holds the man's head against the car's side window.  Mills'
     free hand pounds the thug's face: once, twice -- third time's
     the charm as the window shatters.  The thug goes out cold.

     Mills backs off, still incensed.  He rubs his throat, looking at
     the two prone men.  Slowly, he regains some composure.

     He takes a keychain from his pocket.  He unlocks the door of the
     car, loads one of the thugs into the back seat.  He walks to
     collect the other thug off the street.


     INT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- MORNING

     Somerset picks items off a moving box:  keys, wallet, homicide
     badge.  Finally, he opens the hardcover book from the train.

     From the pages, he takes the pale, wallpaper rose.


     INT.  TENEMENT APARTMENT -- DAY

     A wall is stained by a starburst of blood.  Somerset stands,
     melancholy, looking at a body on the floor under a sheet near a
     sawed-off shotgun.  The apartment is gloomy.  DETECTIVE TAYLOR,
     52, looks through a notepad.

                                  TAYLOR
                   Neighbors heard them screaming at each
                   other.  It was nothing new or unusual.
                   But, then they heard the gun go off.
                   Boom, boom... both barrels.

                                  SOMERSET
                   Did his wife confess?  Did she actually
                   speak the words?

                                  TAYLOR
                   When the patrolman got here she was
                   trying to put his head back together.
                   She was crying too hard to say anything.
                           (shuts notebook)
                   Crime of passion.

                                  SOMERSET
                   Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered
                   up on the wall here.

     Taylor shifts his weight, impatient, annoyed.

                                  TAYLOR
                   This is a done deal.  All but the
                   paperwork.

     Somerset looks at a coloring-book open on the coffee table.
     There are crayons beside it.  Somerset picks the book up.

     He flips through: crudely colored pictures.

                                  SOMERSET
                   Did their son see it happen?

                                  TAYLOR
                   What kind of question is that?  Huh?
                           (pointing)
                   He's dead.  His wife killed him.  There
                   it is.  That's all.  Anything else has
                   nothing to do with nothing.

     Somerset replaces the book, digs up a cigarette from his pocket.

                                  TAYLOR (CONT)
                   You and your fucking questions,
                   Somerset.  I'm glad I'm getting rid of
                   you today.  You know that, you fuck?

     David Mills enters, dressed in a suit.  He looks a bit lost.

                                  MILLS
                   Uh... Lieutenant Somerset?

     Somerset lights his cigarette, looks to Mills.

                                  MILLS (CONT)
                   I'm David Mills... your new partner.


     EXT.  TENEMENT/CITY STREET -- DAY

     A body-bag is carried through the crowd around the tenement
     doors.  Somerset follows.  Mills follows Somerset.  They walk
     towards the end of the filthy block.

                                  MILLS
                   I'm a little thrown.  I just finished
                   orientation at central, and they dumped
                   me off down here.

                                  SOMERSET
                   I heard you brought in two small-timers
                   last night.

                                  MILLS
                   Yeah.  Two real idiots.

                                  SOMERSET
                   Since we are just starting out, I
                   thought we could go to a bar.  Sit and
                   talk for awhile.  That way we can...

                                  MILLS
                   Excuse me, but I'd rather start sniffing
                   for a case, if it's all the same to you.
                   Seeing how we only have a week for this
                   whole transition thing.
                           (waits)
                   I want to get into the shit a.s.a.p.,
                   know what I mean?

     Somerset walks, no reply.  Mills searches to get a read on him.

                                  SOMERSET
                   I meant to ask you something... when we
                   spoke on the phone.  I can't help
                   wondering...
                           (pause)
                   Why are you here?

                                  MILLS
                           (wary)
                   I... I don't follow.

                                  SOMERSET
                   All this effort you've gone through, to
                   be transferred from Philadelphia to
                   here.  It's the first question that pops
                   into my head.

     Mills formulates his response.

                                  MILLS
                   I'm here for the same reasons as you, I
                   guess.  Or... at least the same reasons
                   you used to have for being here...
                           (cutting)
                   ...before you decided to give up.

     Somerset stops and faces Mills.

                                  SOMERSET
                   You think you know me?  You just met me
                   two minutes ago.

                                  MILLS
                   Maybe I don't understand the question.

                                  SOMERSET
                   It's very simple.  You've come from the
                   "City of Brotherly Love" to the "City of
                   Brotherly Hate," detective.  I've never
                   seen it done that way.

                                  MILLS
                   I don't know.  Maybe I thought I could
                   do more good here than there.
                           (pause)
                   You know, it'd be great by me if we
                   didn't start right out kicking each
                   other in the balls.  But, you're calling
                   the shots, lieutenant, so however you
                   want it to go.

                                  SOMERSET
                   Let me tell you how I want this to go.
                   I want you to look, and I want you to
                   listen.

                                  MILLS
                   I wasn't standing around Philly guarding
                   the fucking Liberty Bell.

                                  SOMERSET
                   But, you've never worked homicide in
                   this city.

                                  MILLS
                   I realize that.

                                  SOMERSET
                   Well, please do me the favor of
                   remembering it.

     Mills just stares back at Somerset.  Somerset walks.  Mills
     rolls his eyes, looks to heaven like, "what'd I do to deserve
     this?"  He follows Somerset.


     INSERT -- TITLE CARD

     MONDAY

     INT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- EARLY MORNING

     Somerset lies asleep on the bed.  It is still dark outside.
     Relatively quiet.  The PHONE beside the inactive metronome RINGS
     HARSHLY.  Somerset awakens suddenly, rankled.


     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- EARLY MORNING

     It is barely becoming light outside.  Mills can't sleep.

     Alone in a double bed.  He sits up, frustrated.  Sits on the
     edge of the bed and looks around.  The room is a shambles,
     filled with moving boxes.

     The light coming through the window glows upon a football trophy
     on one box.  Large and noble, a golden player stands in frozen
     motion at the trophy's pinnacle.

     Mills looks at the trophy and a fond smile forms on his face.
     The CLINKING of DISHES and SILVERWARE is HEARD from another
     room.  Mills looks at the closed bedroom door, troubled.

     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- EARLY MORNING

     Across a living room full of boxes, TRACY MILLS, 30, a beautiful
     woman, stands in her bathrobe.  She's upset about something,
     takes dishes out of boxes, puts them on the kitchenette counter.

     She pulls a mug from a clump of newspaper and pours some tea
     from a pot on the stove.  Blowing on the steaming tea, she leans
     back on the counter, looks over at the closed bedroom door.

     The tea is too hot to sip, and as Tracy is placing the mug on
     the counter behind her the PHONE RINGS.  Startled, she releases
     the mug too close to the edge.  It falls --

     Crashes to the floor, shatters.


     INT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, HALLWAY -- MORNING

     A dark hall.  Somerset and Mills stand with OFFICER DAVIS, 28, a
     beefy, uniformed cop.  Light from a camera's flash spills in
     from the nearby kitchen.  Davis hands Somerset two flashlights.

                                 SOMERSET
                   At what time did you confirm the death?

                                 DAVIS
                   Like I said, we didn't touch anything,
                   but we were on scene at like o-five-
                   hundred, so he's had his face in a plate
                   of spaghetti for about half an hour.

                                 MILLS
                   Wait, wait, wait.  You didn't check him?
                   You didn't check vital signs?

                                 DAVIS
                   Believe me, he's gone.  Unless he's
                   breathing spaghetti sauce now.

                                 MILLS
                   No.  The point is, when you're first man
                   in, you check vital signs.

                                 DAVIS
                   This guy's sitting in a pile of his own
                   shit and piss.  If he ain't dead he
                   would have stood up by now.

                                 MILLS
                           (getting angry)
                   Listen, Godzilla...

     Somerset steps in, heads Mills off.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Thank you, Officer Davis.  We'll see you
                   again after we've had a look.

                                 DAVIS
                   Yes, sir.

     Davis leaves, eyeing Mills.  Mills watches him.  Somerset hands
     Mills a flashlight, takes out surgical gloves.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I wonder what exactly was the point of
                   the conversation you were about to get
                   into?

                                 MILLS
                   And, I wonder how many times Officer
                   Davis there has found a supposedly dead
                   man who didn't really die until Davis
                   was back in the patrol car calling the
                   morgue and eating a powdered donut.

     Somerset snaps one glove over his hand and checks the fit.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Drop it.  We have more important
                   concerns just now, don't we?

                                 MILLS
                   Fine... for now.

     INT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     The POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER packs up, hoists his camera and
     equipment bag.  Somerset and Mills enter.  Mills puts on his own
     pair of rubber gloves.  The grubby kitchen is small; barely room
     for four people to move around in.  The photographer exits:

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                   Bon appetit.

     The only light is a murky green illumination from the ceiling.

     The light bathes an OBESE MAN who is slumped forward in a
     kitchen chair, face-down-dead in a plate of spaghetti.

     The sizable kitchen table's green tablecloth is covered with
     soiled paper plates.  The plates hold bits of half-eaten
     sandwiches, potatoes, donuts and other junk-food remnants.

     Mills and Somerset turn on their flashlights.  Mills points his
     at the green bulb above.  Aluminum foil has been wrapped around
     the bulb to focus the light on the corpse.

     Somerset sweeps the room with his flashlight.  He goes to the
     body and kneels beside it.  There's a rope tied around the
     man's wide gut.  Mills comes to stand beside Somerset.

                                 MILLS
                   I guess that makes it homicide.

     Somerset crouches lower, uses a pen to lift one of the dead
     man's pants cuffs.  Rope is tied around the purplish ankle.

     Mills examines the knots behind the chair's back.  Shines his
     flashlight on the man's belly.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Still, he could have tied himself in.
                   To make it look like murder.

     Somerset isn't listening, focused on the corpse.  He studies the
     man's head and neck without touching.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   I don't see any blood or bruises yet.
                   No wounds.  You see anything?

                                 SOMERSET
                           (irritated)
                   Not yet.

     Somerset stands, points his flashlight: the obese man's stiff
     hands are clutching utensils.  A knife in the left hand, a fork
     sticking straight up in the right with a hunk of meat hanging
     skewered.  Cockroaches swarm.

     Mills turns to the sink and stove.  Each burner of the stove has
     a used pot or pan on it.  There's food slopped everywhere.

                                 MILLS
                   I saw a guy once... committed suicide,
                   but he wanted to make sure his family
                   could collect insurance money, right?

     Somerset walks to the room's only window.  The window has been
     painted over with black paint.  he touches the window with his
     pinkie finger.  The paint is still wet.

     Mills goes to a trash can by the refrigerator.  The trash can is
     full to the brim with empty food containers.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   So, this guy took this big knife... and
                   he held it behind him, put the tip of it
                   in his back, and he ran backwards into
                   the wall.  Cause, he thought it was
                   going to look like someone stabbed him
                   in the back.

     Mills opens the refrigerator.  It's nearly empty.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Except, he poked a big fucking hole in
                   the dry wall when he did it.

                                 SOMERSET
                   If you could... spare me the anecdotes
                   for now.  Leave the refrigerator open
                   for the light.

                                 MILLS
                           (sarcastic)
                   Oh, forgive me.  I thought we had this
                   male-bonding thing going.  My mistake.

     Somerset looks at the floor, deep in thought.  His flashlight
     beam follows a trail of dripped sauces, soups and bits of food
     running from the stove to the table.

                                 SOMERSET
                   What do you smell?  Other than him, and
                   all the food.

                                 MILLS
                           (sniffs)
                   I don't know... there's something.

     Somerset goes close to the table, then leans to peer under.

                                 SOMERSET
                   A bucket.

     Somerset points the flashlight and Mills crouches, pulls up the
     tablecloth on his side of the table.  Two large dead rats lay on
     the floor beside a metal bucket.

     Mills grimaces, slides under the table, careful to avoid the
     rats.  He looks in the bucket.  He leans back, baffled.

                                 MILLS
                   It's vomit.

     He looks at Somerset under the table.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   It's a bucket of vomit.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Is there any blood in it?

                                 MILLS
                   Can't tell by looking.

     Somerset stands, perplexed, stares at the dead man.  There is a
     knock at the door.  The detectives look to DOCTOR THOMAS
     O'NEILL, 52, the medical examiner.  O'Neill is a frumpy man,
     seems a bit gone, looking at the green bulb.

                                 O'NEILL
                   Mood lighting.  Very sixties.

     He drops his bag on the floor, sorts through the contents.

                                 MILLS
                           (to Somerset)
                   You think he was poisoned?

     Mills goes to the trash can, pokes the garbage with a pencil.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   And, those rats there somehow ate the
                   poison off the floor?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Guessing this early is useless.

                                 O'NEILL
                   You girls have got the forensics guys
                   out there chompin' at the bit.  Don't
                   know if we'll all fit in here though.

     Mills continues searching the garbage.

                                 MILLS
                   There's room.  Light's the problem.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Well, three is certainly a crowd in
                   here.  And, with four, someone's bound
                   to be stepping on evidence.
                           (pause)
                   Detective Mills, go help the officers
                   question the neighbors.

                                 MILLS
                           (not pleased)
                   Thanks, but no thanks.  I'll stay on
                   this.

     Somerset watches O'Neill at the corpse.  O'Neill points a thin
     flashlight with his mouth, his hands free for the examination.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (not looking up)
                   Send one forensic in on your way out.

     Mills is pissed.  He lifts his flashlight to shine it on the
     side of Somerset's face.

     A moment passes.  Somerset looks at Mills, light shining
     directly in Somerset's eyes.  A longer moment.  Mills switches
     the light off.  He leaves.

     O'Neill unceremoniously places both hands on the dead man's
     head, lifts the swollen visage from the spaghetti.

                                 O'NEILL
                   He is dead.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, BASEMENT GYM -- DAY

     THWACK, THWACK... THWACK.  Mills punches the heavy bag with
     hard, quick punches.  Sweat drips off his face.  He's in work-
     out clothing, a bundle of nerves wearing boxing gloves.

     The walls are covered in mirrors.  Other cops watch Mills as
     they pass, checking out the new kid.  Mills keeps punching,
     skillfully.

     He stops when he sees Somerset reflected in one of the mirrors.
     Somerset walks over, carrying a pizza box with paper piled on
     top.  He sits on a near bench, takes out a cigarette.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Pizza and paperwork, Detective Mills.

                                 MILLS
                   We need to chat.

     INT.  BASEMENT GYM, BOXING RING -- DAY

     Mills opens a door and enters with Somerset behind.  They are
     alone.  Chairs face an old, limp-roped boxing ring.  Practice
     pads hang from pegs on a wall.  Mills clasps a pair in his
     gloves, offers them to Somerset.

                                 SOMERSET
                   No.

                                 MILLS
                   You just hold them up.  I do all the
                   work.

     Somerset takes the pads reluctantly, puts them on.  He still has
     the un-lit cigarette hanging from his mouth.  Mills climbs into
     the ring.  He holds the ropes open for Somerset, waits.

     Somerset doesn't want to do this, but he climbs up.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   You've seen my files... seen the things
                   I've done?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Yes.  Impressive work.

     Mills motions to Somerset and Somerset holds up the practice
     pads.  Mills starts working them, lightly, warming up.
     THWACK... THWACK...

                                 MILLS
                   So, what's your problem?  I've done my
                   time on door-to-doors, and walking a
                   beat.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I know it.  That doesn't mean...

                                 MILLS
                   I did all that shit a long time ago.

     THWACK... THWACK... Somerset's very stiff, uncomfortable.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I made a decision, because I have to
                   worry about the integrity of the scene.

                                 MILLS
                   That's bullshit.

                                 SOMERSET
                   When I'm on scene, I'm not going to
                   worry whether you think you're getting
                   enough time on the playing field.  I'm
                   there to do the work.

     Mills punches a little more aggressively.  Somerset's backing,
     flinching, keeping the pads high.  THWACK... THWACK... THWACK...

                                 MILLS
                   The badge in my pocket says "detective,"
                   just like yours.  I've been Homicide for
                   four and a half years.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You've worked Homicide for four years,
                   or for five years...
                   Don't count the half-years, unless you
                   want to sound like a rookie.

     Mills unloads a mighty wallop and one practice pad recoils into
     Somerset's face, knocks Somerset on his ass.

                                 MILLS
                   Oops.  My hand slipped.

     Mills walks, climbs out of the ring.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   You fucked me over today, and you know
                   it.  You know it.

     Somerset looks at the broken cigarette in his mouth.  He
     contains his anger.  He seems to realize Mills has a point.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Just don't jerk me off.  That's all I
                   ask.  It's not much.  Don't jerk me off.
                           (pause)
                   Please, do me the favor of remembering
                   that.

     Mills exits.  Somerset spits out the broken cigarette.


     INT.  URBAN SCHOOL, OFFICE -- DAY

     Tracy looks out a window from behind steel bars.

     Below her, young children play in a playground.  They're playing
     hop-scotch, throwing balls, chasing each other.  The swing sets
     are broken.  The handball wall is graffitied.

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                   I'm sorry, Mrs. Mills.  We don't have
                   anything right now.

     Tracy looks away from the window to the haggard WOMAN.  The
     school's office is ill-equipped, busy, disorganized.

                                 WOMAN (CONT)
                   We'll try to give you a call if we need
                   substitutes next month.

                                 TRACY
                   Thank you.

     Tracy looks back at the playground: on the other side of a
     chain-link fence, a butcher in a bloody apron walks down the
     ramp of a freezer truck.  he carries a big, whole, slaughtered
     pig on his shoulder.

     The pig's head flops as the butcher walks.  Some children stop
     their games and run to watch the man and the pig corpse pass.


     INT.  UNDERGROUND SUBWAY TRAIN -- DAY

     The train clatters through a tunnel, packed full, WHEELS
     SCREECHING.  The lights go on and off.  Passengers read
     tabloids, stare at their feet, study advertisements on the
     walls; anything to avoid making eye-contact with others.

     All races, creeds and colors; all ugly, forlorn human beings.
     Tracy stands fatigued, holding a handrail.

     A bag-lady, crusted with dirt, reeking, pushes her way through
     the crowd.  A man presses against Tracy in an attempt to let the
     bag-lady pass.  Tracy switches hands on the rail, turns sideways
     to make room.  She looks down.

     On one seat, a man, quite normal looking, sits holding a porno
     magazine, THREE-WAY FUCK, in one hand.  His other hand is in his
     pocket.  He's obviously masturbating himself in his pants.  No
     one else notices or seems to care.

     Tracy looks away, disgusted.  She closes her eyes.  The train's
     wheels SCREECH LOUDER as the train takes a curve.


     INT.  INDOOR FRUIT STAND -- NIGHT

     The front and one side of the shop are entirely open to the busy
     sidewalk and street.  A transparent plastic canopy frames the
     entrance.  A STRANGE MAN, 20, stands at the edge of the canopy.
     He wears a stained sweatsuit outfit and hums a song, oblivious.

     Tracy and Mills look together over the piles of fruits and
     vegetables piled on wooden stands which form tight aisles.

                                 MILLS
                   It was okay.  I mean... it was certainly
                   better than yesterday.  I think Somerset
                   and I came to a small understanding...

     Mills holds his thumb and forefinger about a quarter of an inch
     apart to illustrate.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   ...about this big.

                                 TRACY
                   He sounds interesting.

                                 MILLS
                   He is that, if nothing else.

     Mills throws some oranges in the basket hanging from Tracy's
     arm.  He goes to check out the carrots.  Tracy looks up from
     heads of lettuce to the strange man at the entrance.

     The strange man hums on, rocking back and forth slowly, his eyes
     glassy.  Customers come and go, paying him no mind.

     Mills notices Tracy's interest.  He keeps comparing carrots.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   We started a big homicide case today.
                   I'll spare you the grisly details.

     The strange man suddenly stops humming and looks into the store
     with a crooked grin.

                                 STRANGE MAN
                   Name that tune?  Anybody name that tune?
                   Name that tune...

     The man keeps repeating this, over and over, still ignored.

                                 TRACY
                   It's... it's like they emptied all the
                   insane asylums into the streets.

     She looks back to the heads of lettuce.

                                 TRACY (CONT)
                   That's what it's like.  Like they just
                   gave up, and let everyone out.

     Mills nods, his back to Tracy.

                                 TRACY (CONT)
                   There are a lot of frightening people in
                   this city.

                                 MILLS
                   There are a lot of frightening people in
                   the world.

     Tracy looks again to the strange man.

                                 STRANGE MAN
                   Name that tune?  Anybody name that tune?

                                 TRACY
                   It seems worse than Philadelphia,
                   because everything is pushed right up
                   against you.  In your face.

     Mills edges past Tracy towards the front of the store, tries to
     be pleasant.

                                 MILLS
                   Listen, honey.  I don't want to fight
                   tonight.  Okay?  Can we just go one
                   night without fighting about something?

     He looks over apples, thinks that's the end of that.

                                 TRACY
                   I'm not trying to start a fight.
                           (pause)
                   How am I trying to start a fight?

                                 MILLS
                   We're here now.  Okay.  Are we supposed
                   to pack it all in and go back?  How are
                   we going to do that?

                                 TRACY
                   Do I have to act like I love this place?
                   Is that what a "good wife" would do?

                                 MILLS
                           (doleful)
                   There's a lot of pressure on me... I...

                                 TRACY
                   And, there's a lot of pressure on me.
                   I'm here with you.

                                 MILLS
                   I know.  I know...

     Mills steps towards the open air entrance.  He's watching
     something.  The strange man is still heard offscreen.

     Tracy reaches to a high wooden shelf, trying to reach a bag of
     rice, her back to Mills.

                                 TRACY
                   I'm not going to close my eyes and block
                   everything out, David.  I'm not going to
                   act like you delivered us to some sort
                   of paradise.  I can't...

     She gets the rice and turns.  Mills is not there.  She sighs,
     angry, looks around.  She walks towards the entrance and sees
     him --

     TRACY'S P.O.V. -- THE STREET

     In front of the stand, Mills has run to the corner of the
     sidewalk to help a very old woman with a cane.  The elderly
     woman smiles up at Mills, takes his arm as he helps her off the
     curb and across the street.  He talks to her as they go.

     INT.  INDOOR FRUIT STAND -- NIGHT

     Tracy's anger fades.  She shakes her head, touched, amazed by
     the plain boy scoutishness of her husband.

     TRACY'S P.O.V. -- THE STREET

     Mills deposits the old woman on the other side.  She thanks him,
     patting him on the cheek.  Mills starts back towards the fruit
     stand, proud of himself.  A car screeches to a halt, just
     missing him.  The driver leans out the window, yelling at Mills.
     Mills kicks the side of the car.

                                 MILLS
                   Fuck you.
                           (as car leaves)
                   Fuck you, you son of a bitch!  I'm
                   walking here.

     INT.  INDOOR FRUIT STAND -- NIGHT

     Tracy rolls her eyes in amused disappointment.  She sighs again.

     Mills passes the babbling strange man, comes up to Tracy.

                                 MILLS
                   I'm sorry... I couldn't pass it up.  I
                   never had a chance to actually do that.
                   But, we can start the argument right
                   back up where we left off, right?

     Tracy looks at him, charmed, no longer willing to fight.

                                 MILLS
                           (playing dumb)
                   What?

     Tracy wraps an arm around Mills and kisses him.  He holds her.

                                 STRANGE MAN
                   That was the theme from tv's Mod Squad.
                   I'm surprised nobody got that one.

     The strange man starts humming a new tune.  An old man tries to
     get through the aisle where Mills and Tracy are kissing.

                                 OLD MAN
                           (infuriated)
                   Excuse me.  Excuse me!


     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     A small transistor RADIO PLAYS on the bedside table.

     Mills and Tracy are in bed, making love under the sheets.  They
     move rhythmically, kissing, sweating hard.

     Mills holds Tracy's hair in his hands, pulls her head back as
     she gasps and he thrusts his entire body against hers.

     Mills' hair is soaked.  He is anything but mellow as a lover,
     quickening while Tracy twists underneath him.  Tracy holds tight
     to the back of his neck with one hand.

     Finally, Mills pushes himself up on his arms, holding his head
     down against Tracy's chest.  Holds for a long moment, till he is
     spent and lowers himself against her, into her arms.  He rests a
     long time.  She kisses his forehead, keeping her eyes closed.

     Finally, Mills rolls off her, gets behind her and wraps the both
     of them in the sheets.  He folds himself against her, and they
     stay that way.

                                 TRACY
                   Goodnight.

                                 MILLS
                   Goodnight.

     After a long moment, Mills shifts back, sits up.  Tracy looks
     over her shoulder at him as he takes a towel off a chair and
     stands.  Mills wraps the towel around his waist.

     He leans over to give Tracy a last kiss.  She watches him leave
     the room.  She is about to say something, but does not.  A light
     comes on in the other room, leaking through the door.

     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Mills sits down at his desk.  He starts looking through police
     paperwork.  The RADIO in the other room goes OFF in mid song.


     INSERT -- TITLE CARD

     TUESDAY

     INT.  AUTOPSY ROOM -- EARLY MORNING

     The room is cold, clean.  Stainless steel.  White tile.  Many
     pathologists work at slabs.  Mills and Somerset are with DOCTOR
     SANTIAGO, 35, who stands over the mostly dissected obese corpse.

                                 SANTIAGO
                   If you take a look here, buddies...
                   I can tell you, it was not a poison.
                   If you can see...
                   I have emptied all of everything out of
                   the stomach.  But, look at it, now that
                   I took away the liver.

     Santiago reaches into the belly of the cavernous corpse.  Mills
     moves closer beside Somerset, but not too close, trying to hide
     his disgust.  We hear squashy sounds as Santiago works, but we
     don't see in.

                                 SANTIAGO (CONT)
                   I move the lungs over.  First, see how
                   big this fat son-of-a-bitch stomach is.
                   Now... here is the strange thing, on the
                   stomach.  Stretches.
                           (pointing)
                   And, here is it distended.  Look at the
                   size of that, because of the foods.

                                 MILLS
                   I can see what you're pointing at...

                                 SANTIAGO
                   On the stomach.  The lines of
                   distention.

     Somerset's looking in, not believing what he sees.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Doctor, are you saying this man... ate
                   till he burst?

                                 SANTIAGO
                   Yes, well, he didn't actually burst.  He
                   was bleeding, inside of himself.
                   And, there's a hemotoma on the
                   outside... on the belly.

     Somerset walks around the slab, looking the body over.

                                 MILLS
                   He died by eating?

                                 SANTIAGO
                   Someone punched him, or kicked him.

     Somerset notices something on the partially shaved head.

     He leans close to look at five or six small bruises on the back
     of the dead man's head; circular bruises, some darker than
     others, all about the same diameter as a dime.

                                 SANTIAGO (CONT)
                   Oh, and there is this here... something
                   else you have to look at and see.

     Somerset stands straight, realizes something about the bruises.

                                 SANTIAGO (CONT)
                   Most of his stomach contents are in the
                   lab now... but, this.  I found these in
                   the fat man's stomach.

     Santiago looks amongst tools, buckets and jars of liquid.  He
     picks up a glass jar and shows it to Mills.  In the jar: many
     little bits of blue plastic.  Like scrapings.

                                 MILLS
                   Plastic?

     Mills gets Somerset's attention, hands him the jar.  Somerset
     looks at it a long time.

                                 SANTIAGO
                   Why these were in a fat man's stomach, I
                   don't know.


     INT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, HALLWAY -- MORNING

     Outside the door to the murder scene, Mills and Somerset cut
     through the RESTRICTED AREA/CRIME SCENE seal.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Those bruises on the back of the
                   victim's head were caused by the muzzle
                   of a gun.

                                 MILLS
                   So, the killer had him at gunpoint, and
                   gave him a choice: eat, or get your head
                   blown off.

     INT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, KITCHEN -- MORNING

     Somerset and Mills enter.  Somerset takes out the jar of plastic
     scrapings, turns on the now normal light.  They begin to search.

                                 SOMERSET
                   He was force-fed... till his body
                   started rejecting the food.  He
                   literally couldn't eat another bite.

                                 MILLS
                   So, the killer held a bucket under him.

                                 SOMERSET
                   His throat was swollen from the effort.
                   He was bleeding internally.
                   He must have blacked out... and, if
                   you're the killer, you're not going to
                   want to wait around for him to die.

     Somerset examines the counter tops and wall.  Mills gets down on
     his knees, examines the linoleum floor.

                                 MILLS
                   You kick him, pop him like a fucking
                   balloon.
                           (touches floor)
                   Somerset, look here.

     Somerset gets down, holds the jar against the linoleum.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Same color and texture.

     They both crawl on hands and knees, study every inch of floor.

                                 MILLS
                   If this is what that is... it doesn't
                   make sense.  It doesn't figure.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Always look for one thing to focus on.
                   There's always one singular thing, and
                   it might be as small as a speck of dust,
                   but find it and focus... till it's an
                   exhausted possibility.

                                 MILLS
                   How are pieces of the floor going to get
                   in the guy's stomach?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Exactly.  Why would so many pieces be
                   inside his stomach unless they were
                   placed there intentionally?

     Somerset notices deep scratches in the linoleum, fingers the
     grooves.  He takes a piece of plastic from the jar, holds it to
     the scratches, fiddles with it, fits it in.  He looks up to see,
     these scratches are in front of the refrigerator.  It looks like
     they were caused by the refrigerator having been pulled away
     from the wall and pushed back at some time.

     INT.  APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, KITCHEN -- LATER MORNING

     We are BEHIND THE REFRIGERATOR as it is rocked back and forth.
     It's pulled away from the wall.  Somerset and Mills strain, pull
     a few more feet, then release.  They lean to look --

     The refrigerator had hidden a space on the wall where the dust
     has been cleared.  In that space: a circle, smeared in grease,
     and a note taped in the center of the circle.

     Somerset's BEEPER starts BEEPING.  Mills leans to read:

                                 MILLS
                   "Dear Detectives.  Long is the way, and
                   hard, that out of hell leads up to the
                   light."
                           (looks at Somerset)
                   This is not good.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Milton.

                                 MILLS
                   What?

                                 SOMERSET
                   It's a quote from a book.  Milton's
                   Paradise Lost.

     Somerset takes out his beeper, looks at the LED window.  He
     looks up at Mills, like they've received very bad news.


     INT.  LUXURY APARTMENTS, HALLWAY -- MORNING

     A marble hallway.  A DETECTIVE, 50, nervously chewing his nails,
     quickly leads Mills and Somerset past cops and forensics.

                                 DETECTIVE
                   I said to myself, I'm not going to screw
                   around with this.  Nope.  Fuck that.
                   It's still pretty fresh meat.  I called
                   the medical examiner... he's coming.
                           (stops at door)
                   When I got to it, I knew.  As soon as I
                   laid eyes on it, I knew...

     The detective opens the door.  FOLLOW Somerset and Mills --

     INT.  LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, LIVING ROOM -- MORNING

     Gross, deep yellow light comes through the only window with its
     blinds up.  The light anoints a NUDE MAN displayed, dead.

                                 DETECTIVE (O.S.)
                   ...this is your guy who did this.

     The nude dead man's legs are folded under him as if he were
     kneeling, and he's bent forward, chin on the floor.  His eyes
     are open, his arms outstretched before him.  Mills and Somerset
     walk to either side of the man.

     The detective closes the door, bites his thumbnail.  The
     apartment is on a high floor, so it's quiet.

     Somerset sees the window has been covered with a sheet of yellow
     gel, stapled in place to produce the colored light.

     Mills examines the corpse.  There's a chair one foot behind the
     nude man.  It's an elegant leather chair, drenched in blood.
     There's a carving knife on the carpet in the middle of a huge
     stain of blood under the chair.  Mills looks at pieces of cut
     rope on the floor behind the chair.  The rope is knotted.

     Somerset crouches beside the body.  There's a big piece of flesh
     missing from the man's left side, as if the love-handle had been
     lopped off.  Hundreds of pennies lie scattered under and around
     the man.  The man's hands are palms up, fingers wrapped around
     more pennies.

     Mills walks over to examine a scale on the floor between the
     corpse and the doorway.  It's an old-fashioned counter-balance
     scale with two suspended dishes on a see-saw arm.  In the high
     dish: the hunk of flesh missing from the man's side.  In the low
     dish: a one pound counterweight.

                                 MILLS
                           (to Somerset)
                   A pound of flesh.

     Somerset stands and walks backwards to view the entire scene
     from near the door.

     He looks worried, vaguely frightened.  He turns his head, looks
     to a far wall.  Beside a big, abstract, constructivist painting,
     there's a note pinned up inside a triangular smear of blood.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING

     An office full of pictures, books and mugsheets, yet it is
     meticulously well kept.  The CAPTAIN, 50, sits at his tidy desk.
     He's dressed conservatively.  Mills and Somerset sit before him.
     Somerset reads from a photocopy of the note they just found.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (reading)
                   "One pound of flesh, no more no less. No
                   cartilage, no bone, but only flesh.
                   This task done, and he would go free."

     The captain is a calm man, but whenever not speaking, without
     fail, he clenches his jaw repeatedly, causing the muscles in his
     neck and jaw to pulse.

     Somerset stands, paces.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   This victim, Mr. Gold, was tied down
                   nude, holding a carving knife.  And he
                   was given a long time... to decide.
                   Where to make the first cut?  There's a
                   gun to your head... but, what part or
                   parts of your body are expendable?

     Mills sits back in his chair, arms crossed, seems anxious,
     doesn't know why they're here.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   Mr. Gold tried for the whole pound at
                   once, his love handle.  But, he went
                   into shock.  Bled to death.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   What is the point, Somerset?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Look at both killings together.  This
                   murderer is an artist.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   An artist?

                                 SOMERSET
                   He uses colors and symbols.  He
                   positions the bodies after death, so
                   he's working with composition.  It's
                   been premeditated so meticulously... and
                   this is just the beginning.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Wrong.  For all we know, we might never
                   hear from him again, and I don't want
                   that kind of talk floating around.

     Somerset shakes his head "no."

                                 SOMERSET
                   The rats and the pennies.  The circle
                   and the triangle on the wall.  There's
                   something about them... these murders
                   mean something.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   So?  What?

     Somerset has no answer.  The captain is irked, jaw clenching.

                                 CAPTAIN (CONT)
                           (to Mills)
                   You with him, or you just here to watch?

                                 MILLS
                   This is his stuff, captain.  I've been
                   out in the cold most of the day.

                                 CAPTAIN
                           (to Somerset)
                   Always working overtime up in that big
                   brain of yours, huh?  Always cooking.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I need you to know... I want us
                   reassigned.  We're declining this case.

                                 MILLS
                           (sits up, angry)
                   What?!

                                 CAPTAIN
                   What the hell are you talking about?

                                 SOMERSET
                   This cannot be my last duty here.  It's
                   going to go on and on.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   You've left unfinished business before.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Everything else was taken as close to a
                   conclusion as humanly possible.

                                 MILLS
                   Can I just say something?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Also... I don't think this should be
                   Mills' first case.

                                 MILLS
                   This is not my first case, fuckhead!

                                 CAPTAIN
                   I don't have anyone else to give this
                   to, Somerset.  And nobody's going to
                   swap with you.

                                 MILLS
                   Give it to me, then.  There's nothing
                   that says I have to fly with him.

     The captain considers this.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   If Somerset wants out, fuck him.

                                 SOMERSET
                   It would be too much for him, too soon.

                                 MILLS
                           (to captain)
                   Could we talk about this in private?

     The captain looks at Somerset, then at Mills.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   That's not necessary.  You're in.

                                 MILLS
                   Thank you, sir.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Start picking up the pieces.  I'll
                   shuffle some paper and try to get you a
                   new partner.

     Mills stands.  Somerset will not look him in the eye.  Mills
     leaves, slams the door.  Somerset seems deflated.

                                 CAPTAIN (CONT)
                   You win, Somerset.  You're out.


     INSERT -- TITLE CARD

     WEDNESDAY

     EXT.  CITY STREET -- MORNING

     A vendor lays out a pile of tabloid newspapers at his busy
     newsstand.  The headline: SECOND BIZARRE MURDER!, in huge print.

     The vendor lays out another tabloid pile.  Headline: "GIVE ME MY
     POUND OF FLESH," SAYS BLOODTHRISTY KILLER, in big, red letters.
     The vendor places a third pile beside the others:  SICKENING
     MURDERS - EXCLUSIVE DETAILS INSIDE!!!


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- MORNING

     Old office.  Moving boxes on the floor.  The single window faces
     a billboard.  Somerset works on a manual typewriter.  He types
     hunt-and-peck, slowly.  His paperwork is on the desk in two
     sloppy piles.  A jarring SOUND is HEARD OFFSCREEN, like fingers
     on a blackboard.  Somerset looks up, irritated.

     A WORKMAN is working at the open door, holding the source of the
     sound, a razor blade he's using to scrape the words DETECTIVE
     SOMERSET off the door's window.

                                 WORKMAN
                   Sorry.

     Somerset turns back to typing.  The captain steps in, looks at
     the workman, then drops more papers on Somerset's desk.

     As always, the neatly groomed captain clenches his jaw.  He
     looks around.  Two of boxes on the floor have DETECTIVE MILLS
     written across them.  The captain picks one up, puts it on top
     of the other.  He sits, watching Somerset, starts straightening
     the forms on the desk.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   What are you going to do with yourself
                   out there, Somerset?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'll get a job.  Maybe on a farm.  I'll
                   fix up my house.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Can't you feel it yet?
                           (pause)
                   Can't you feel that feeling... that you
                   won't be special anymore?

                                 SOMERSET
                           (lying)
                   I don't know what you mean.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   You know.

     Somerset reclines, looks at the captain.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Did you read in the paper today, about
                   the man who took his dog for a walk?
                   And how he was mugged?  And, his wallet
                   was taken, and his watch.  Then, while
                   he was still lying unconscious, his
                   attacker stabbed him with a knife in
                   both eyes.  It happened last night.  Not
                   far from here.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   I heard.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I have no understanding of this place.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   It's always been like this.

     Somerset saddles up to the typewriter.  Hunt-and-peck.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Yes.  You're absolutely right.

     The captain lays the paperwork down in two neat stacks.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   You were made for this work, Somerset.
                   I can't believe you're going to trade it
                   all in for a tool belt and a fishing
                   rod.  But, I guess I'm wrong.

     The captain leaves.  Somerset looks up now that the captain's
     gone.  He grabs the paper piles and ruffles them back to their
     disheveled state.  He looks at the workman.

     The workman is looking at Somerset, has a rag in his hand to
     remove the last remnants of Somerset's name.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (angrily)
                   Put a little elbow grease into it!

     The workman is startled, continues his work.


     INT.  LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, LIVING ROOM -- DAY

     The grandly furnished apartment where the second murder took
     place has been dusted for prints and searched.

     Two female forensics are at work.

     INT.  LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, MASTER BEDROOM -- DAY

     Mills is seated in front of a long writing desk with many
     drawers.  All the drawers are open.  Mills looks through letters
     and stationary.  Nothing of use.  He tosses the pile back.

     He sits back, frustrated, yanks off one rubber glove, looks
     around the room.  Books have been taken off their shelves, the
     bed has been stripped.  The room has been given the once over.

     The victim's family photographs hang in expensive frames on one
     wall.  There are at least thirty photos of various sizes:
     ancestors, sons and daughters, grandchildren and friends.  An
     over-weight forensic, CHRIS, 35, leans in through the doorway.

     Mills looks up and Chris shakes his head glumly.

                                 MILLS
                   He must have left us another puzzle to
                   solve... somewhere.

                                 CHRIS
                   We'll keep looking, but we're running
                   out of possibilities.

     Chris leaves and Mills stands to stretch.  Something catches
     Mills' eye.  He walks over to the door, curious.  At the base of
     the open door, there's a ball of paper wedged under to act as a
     doorjamb.  Mills puts his glove back on, pulls the ball out.

     He uncrumples the paper as the door slowly swings shut.  The
     page has a drawing on it, of the sun with waves of heat at its
     edges.  There is a single eye in the center of the sun.

     An arrow is drawn in dried blood on the back of the closing
     door.  Mills notices this and pushes the door closed.

     The blood arrow points to the side and up, seems to be pointing
     to the photo gallery wall.  Mills goes to examine the photos.

     His eyes search each photo... one by one... till he sees it:

                                 MILLS
                   Christ...

     A framed photo of a falsely pretty, middle-aged woman smiling
     and wearing pearls.  Under the glass, on the photo itself,
     circles have been drawn in blood around the woman's eyes.


     EXT.  CITY STREETS, DOWNTOWN -- NIGHT

     An assault on the senses.  Crowded streets and sidewalks.  On
     every corner, in every doorway, on every stairwell -- freaks,
     junkies, punks, leather boys and motorcycle girls.  A few
     tourists wander in the mix, heedful of the dangers around them.
     Buildings border narrowly.

     Somerset walks against the stream.  He carries a file.

     CAR HORNS HOWL.  MUSIC BLASTS from the entrances of clubs.
     REGGAE from one club is soon OVERTAKEN by RAP from a second
     story window.  TECHNO-POP blasts from the tattoo parlor.

     Somerset does not like this place, views it with disdain.  He
     walks to avoid two men fighting on the ground.  The men are
     pulling hair and pounding each other idiotically.

     Somerset takes a cigarette from a full pack, lights it as he
     crosses through the traffic jam in the street.  A VAGRANT steps
     up with his hand out.

                                 VAGRANT
                   Spare me a cigarette, money-grip?  Spare
                   me a cigarette?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Sorry.  Last one.

     He walks on.  We BEGIN to HEAR JAZZ MUSIC.

     INT.  JAZZ CLUB -- NIGHT

     A club at capacity.  The JAZZ MUSIC CONTINUES like a slow, cool
     breeze from a JAZZ TRIO on a platform.

     The air is thick with smoke.  Yuppies sit elbow to elbow with
     the last members of the beat generation.  Everyone's drinking
     beer, smoking pot.

     Somerset crosses the club, looking for someone.  He takes a
     tissue from his pocket, rips pieces off and jams the pieces in
     his ears.  At the back of the club, a major-league bouncer
     stands in front of a closed door.  Somerset shows his badge and
     the bouncer steps aside with reservation.

     INT.  NARROW STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

     The walls are black.  Somerset opens the door, enters, walks
     down the long flight of stairs.  As Somerset descends, the JAZZ
     MUSIC FADES and is ENGULFED by the sound of SPEED METAL.
     DEAFENING.

     At the bottom, Somerset opens another door.  He enters --

     INT.  UNDERGROUND ART GALLERY -- NIGHT

     A narrow room.  SPEED METAL is even LOUDER.  This is a private
     art party.  The people are lizard-like, pale.  Men and women
     priding themselves on their gauntness.

     Somerset passes canvases on the walls.  Pointlessly abstract
     paintings.  Splatters, smears and blobs of color.

     Party-people stand in front of these "works," engrossed.
     Somerset slides past, not interested in the art, jamming the
     tissue further in his ears.  He spots his objective.

     WILLIAM McCRACKEN, 42, stands inside a circle of admirers.  He is
     dressed like a pauper, his baggy clothing stained with many
     colors of paint.  He wears dark sunglasses, bored by the
     bleached-blonde girl whispering in his ear.

     Somerset worms his way to stand in front of William.  The party-
     goers turn their attention to this intrusion.

     William looks up, pushes the girl away.  He takes off his
     sunglasses.  His eyes are badly bloodshot and listless.

     He looks Somerset over... and then grins, glad to see him.


     INT.  MILL'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     Mills stands brooding over a photocopy of the picture of the
     woman with her eyes circled in blood.  He looks overworked,
     drinks coffee.  His desk is swamped with files.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                   I have voiced the same concerns to our
                   law enforcement officials, and they
                   assure me he is of the highest caliber.

     Mills looks to a t.v. on a table, picks up a remote, increases
     the volume.  On the screen, MARTIN TALBOT, 47, source of the
     voice, stands before reporters.  He's a powerful presence, with
     a gold tooth in the front of his mouth.

                                 A REPORTER (V.O.)
                           (from t.v.)
                   As District Attorney, don't you feel
                   some responsibility?  Detective David
                   Mills lacks the experience...

                                 TALBOT (V.O.)
                           (from t.v.)
                   I've always said... I've always said,
                   don't send a boy to do a man's job.

     Mills is hanging on every word.

                                 TALBOT (V.O.,CONT)
                   But, David Mills has a sterling record
                   with the Philadelphia force.  I stand
                   behind him one hundred percent.

                                 MILLS
                           (relieved)
                   You tell 'em boss.  Detective David
                   Mills is a wonderful human being...

                                 TALBOT (V.O.)
                   However... however... let me say this...

     Mills looks back at the television.

                                 TALBOT (V.O.,CONT)
                   If Detective Mills, at any point in this
                   investigation... if he is not pulling
                   his weight, I will be the first in line
                   to pull his plug.

     Mills points the remote, turns the t.v. off as reporters crowd
     Talbot.  Mills stares at the blank screen, dispirited.

     Across the room, Tracy stands in the doorway.  Mills does not
     see her.  He looks at the photocopy and sits at his desk.

     Tracy watches him, great concern in her sad eyes.


     INT.  WILLIAM'S STUDIO/APARTMENT -- NIGHT

     Somerset walks through this vast artist's studio, a converted
     warehouse space filled with canvases.  It's clear the works at
     the underground art gallery were William's.  William climbs a
     ladder to a loft storage space.  He moves cautiously, like he's
     not quite up to the task.

                                 WILLIAM
                   I always figured that's the only reason
                   you and I used to be friends.  Because I
                   was a friend of hers.

     William yanks a painting wrapped in dusty paper, climbs down.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   Speaking of which...

     William hands the painting to Somerset, walks to a director's
     chair facing a paint-splashed canvas on an easel.  He is a used-
     up man, bound in an apathy-induced haze.  He sits, picks up a
     squeeze bottle of orange paint from a table of supplies.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   I painted that about five years ago.  I
                   always told myself I'd give it to you
                   next time I saw you.

     Somerset starts unwrapping the painting.

     William "paints," using the squeeze bottles and by flicking
     saturated brushes so that the paint flies against the canvas.
     Most times, he's not even looking at the canvas or colors he's
     using.  He looks over his shoulder at Somerset.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   Things are different these days, pal.
                   You wouldn't believe it...

     Somerset looks at the unwrapped painting and is hit by a swell
     of memories.  Horribly sad memories.  It's a portrait in oils of
     a pretty, red-headed woman.

     William shoots red paint with one hand, concentrates on
     lighting a filterless cigarette with the other.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   People buy my paintings now... they
                   drive down in their BMWs and Rolls
                   Royces.  It's the new money generation.
                   I guess they think they're touching the
                   avant-garde...

     William looks at his creation, then calmly kicks the easel over.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   There's another thousand dollar William
                   McCracken expression of anarchy.

     William gets up, walks across the wet canvas, leaving
     footprints.  He looks down at what he's done.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   Make that two thousand.

     He laughs.  Somerset holds up the delicately rendered portrait.

                                 SOMERSET
                   How is she?  Have you seen her recently?

                                 WILLIAM
                   Huh... oh.  No.  She moved out of the
                   city.  Last winter.  She married some
                   businessman, or something like that.

     Somerset fights the anguish this causes, puts the painting down.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Good for her.
                           (pause)
                   I'm leaving soon myself.  I'm finally
                   getting out.

                                 WILLIAM
                   Yeah?  What happened to the idealistic
                   super-cop I used to know?

                                 SOMERSET
                   He became a realist.

     William grunts, flicks his cigarette away, takes out a bag of
     pills.  He palms a few, notices the judgment in Somerset's eyes.

                                 WILLIAM
                   Oh... sorry.

     William turns his back to Somerset, pops the pills.  Out of
     sight, out of mind.  Somerset is disappointed, disgusted.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (sarcastic)
                   Not that I don't appreciate your recent
                   artistic endeavors... but, what happened
                   to the painter I used to know?

     William smiles like a dolt, laughs a little.

                                 WILLIAM
                   I can't remember.

     INT.  WILLIAM'S STUDIO/APARTMENT -- LATER NIGHT

     Color photos of the first and second murder sit on a drawing
     table.  The top photos are like establishing shots, each taking
     in the entire display the murderer created.

     William examines with Somerset looking over his shoulder.

                                 WILLIAM
                   Man... can I buy these from you?

                                 SOMERSET
                   They're not for sale.

     Somerset lays out photos of the notes, triangle and circle:

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   What is it?  What's the murderer trying
                   to say?

     William narrows his eyes.  Does not know.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   What picture is he painting?

                                 WILLIAM
                           (figuring)
                   Wait a minute...

     William has an idea.  He ambles over to a row of cabinets where
     oversized art books are stacked.  He hunts through a pile,
     shoves some books aside.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   I... I've seen things like that...

                                 SOMERSET
                   Where?

     William keeps digging, finds one book, finds another.  He opens
     one as he walks back to the drawing table.

                                 WILLIAM
                   It's church stuff.  Christianity.

     William lays a book down, finds a page.  He opens it to
     Somerset.  There is a circle to the side of the text.  It says
     GLUTTONY under the circle.

     Somerset creases his brow, turns the page.  William opens
     another book.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   When it first started... Christian
                   artwork was all from Bible stories.  It
                   was like... nobody had any imagination.
                   It was all... standardized.

     William pages through and we catch glimpses of the bizarre,
     worlds of Hieronymus Bosch.  Horrifying religious visions.

                                 WILLIAM (O.S.,CONT)
                   But, later, everyone started painting to
                   tell their own stories... to teach
                   lessons.  Guys like Bosch, Bregel the
                   elder... Van Eycks.

     William shoves the open book to Somerset.  Somerset looks:

     Seven paintings in a circular pattern showing characters giving
     in to sins.  Wicked, grotesque people.

     Somerset turns the book to examine each painting right side up.

                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)
                   The seven deadly sins.

                                 WILLIAM (O.S.)
                   That's what these murders remind me of.
                   Paintings like these.
                           (points)
                   Gluttony... greed...

                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)
                   Envy, wrath, pride, lust and sloth.
                   Seven deadly sins.

                                 WILLIAM
                   Amen, brother.

     William goes to continue pulling other books.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT)
                   I can find more examples.  There's lots
                   of paintings like those... painted over
                   hundreds of years.
                           (moves books)
                   And you're right... that murderer is an
                   artist.

     Somerset is chilled by all this, immersed in the Bosch book.

                                 SOMERSET
                   And, it's two down... five to go.


     EXT.  CITY STREET, PORNO DISTRICT -- NIGHT

     A bright, tawdry intersection.  Neon swirls and circuit-bulbs on
     porno theatres provide the flash.  Cars, taxies, and barkers
     urging sexual indulgence from doorways provide the noise.

     The streets and sidewalks are crowded with lonely humans, mostly
     men, looking around, sizing up promises made on porno placards:
     FUN WITH NUDES, BIG BOOBS, NAKED DESIRE, etc.  The usual
     contingent of abnormal cretins wanders in the crowd, looking for
     someone to hurt.

     MOVE through the crowds.  Meet JOHN, a balding, middle-aged man,
     wearing thick glasses.  There is not a single thing strange or
     unusual about his appearance.  FOLLOW him as he walks.  He's
     nervous, looking at the porno palaces.

     His sweaty hand clutches a Bible tight against his chest.  He
     doesn't feel comfortable being here.

     John walks to a corner, waits for the light so he may cross.  A
     grotesque STREET PREACHER approaches waving his own Bible.
     People walk away from him, so he confronts John.

                                 PREACHER
                   ...are you, Sir?  Is Jesus Christ your
                   Lord and Master?  Do you believe in Him?

     John tries to ignore, traffic blocking his escape.

                                 PREACHER (CONT)
                           (pleading)
                   Don't ignore me.  Listen to what I have
                   to say.  Christ can be your savior!

                                 JOHN
                           (quiet anger)
                   Leave me alone.

                                 PREACHER
                   Think about God, sir.  I can help you
                   let Him into your life.

     Finally the light changes.  John turns and spits in the
     preacher's face.  The preacher recoils as John crosses quickly.

     John hurries between cars in the crosswalk.  The preacher curses
     from the corner, his voice drowned out in traffic.

     EXT.  ANOTHER CITY STREET, PORNO DISTRICT -- NIGHT

     People pass on the sidewalk.  John is amongst them, but he
     stops, looking up at something offscreen.

     He's looking at a bright red storefront adorned with red neon:
     THE HOT HOUSE.  Massage parlor.  The Hot House's BARKER notices
     John's interest.

                                 BARKER
                   Interesting isn't it, friend?  You like
                   that, you like girls, then come on in.

     John doesn't hear the barker.  Steps up to study fading pictures
     of naked women massaging happy men.  Nudity.

                                 BARKER (CONT)
                   You'll see a lot more inside.  You'll
                   see a lot more than that.

     John's just looking, his face bathed in bright red light, the
     neon reflected in his thick glasses.


     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     Somerset, holding more than an armful of art books and novels,
     pounds on the apartment door.  Tracy opens it with the chain on.

                                 TRACY
                   Can I help you?

     She takes a second to drink Somerset in.  Somerset is surprised,
     having expected Mills.  Tracy is so exquisite that he falters.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Uh... I was looking for Mills.  David, I
                   mean.

                                 TRACY
                   He's not here right now.

     Somerset tries not to drop any books while he digs up his badge.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Mrs. Mills, my name is Somerset.  If I
                   could leave these books for him.

                                 TRACY
                           (undoes chain)
                   Please, come in.

     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- NIGHT

     Tracy leads Somerset into the disarray of the apartment.

                                 TRACY
                   David went for a walk.  To clear his
                   head.  Oh, you can put those here.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Thank you.

     Tracy motions and Somerset puts the books on Mills' desk.
     He starts looking through one book, checking paperclipped pages.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   Could you tell him... tell him this is
                   his reading assignment.  It's urgent.
                   I've marked the most important pages.

                                 TRACY
                   Would you like some coffee, or a drink.
                   David should be back any minute.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I do have to get going.

     Somerset sees a medal encased in glass on the desk amongst pens
     and pencils.  He picks it up: it's a medal for valor from the
     Philadelphia Police Department.

                                 TRACY
                   At least I got to meet you.  David has
                   told me a lot about you.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Really?  Good things, I hope.

                                 TRACY
                   Oh, yes.  He said you were very smart.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Really?

                                 TRACY
                   I think he's a bit intimidated by you.

     Somerset thinks about this, finds it hard to believe.  He goes
     through his pocket, pulls out a notepad and some paper scraps.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'm going to leave him a list of
                   specifics.  It all relates to the case
                   he's on.

     He lays the various scraps and receipts aside on the desk, sits
     to start writing on the notepad.  Tracy goes to the kitchenette
     to get a chair.

                                 TRACY
                   You two aren't working together anymore.
                   Isn't that so?

                                 SOMERSET
                   To be perfectly honest, Mrs. Mills...

                                 TRACY
                   Tracy.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Tracy.  David and I weren't exactly what
                   you could call fast friends.

                                 TRACY
                   That's too bad.

     Tracy brings the chair over by the desk and sits.  Somerset
     looks up from his writing.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I doubt your husband shares that
                   opinion.

     Tracy nods, leaning forward, semi-conspiratorially.

                                 TRACY
                   You know, Somerset, David is very...
                   determined.  I'm sure you've seen, it's
                   not likely he'll ever be compared to
                   Gandhi.

                                 SOMERSET
                   He's a good cop.  He just...

                                 TRACY
                   He sees policework as a crusade.  That's
                   what he wants it to be, and, that might
                   sound naive, but he's made a conscious
                   choice to be naive.
                           (pause)
                   Believe me, his heart's in the right
                   place.

     Somerset pauses, enchanted by her.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I hear you and he were high school
                   sweethearts.

                                 TRACY
                   Yeah.  Pretty hokey, huh?  But, what
                   girl wouldn't want the captain of the
                   football team as their lifelong mate?

                                 SOMERSET
                   It's rare these days... that kind of
                   commitment.

                                 TRACY
                   I guess so.

     Tracy's smile falters a bit.  Somerset notices this.  He breaks
     from her spell, turns to continue writing.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Well... this will only take a minute.

                                 TRACY
                   Take your time.

     Somerset writes.  Tracy looks over the stack of books:

     Titles on the spines: BOSCH, A HISTORY OF CHRISTIAN ART, BREGEL
     THE ELDER, etc.  Hardcover novels: DANTE'S PURGATORY and THE
     CANTERBURY TALES.

     Tracy stands to look at the novels on top, then sees the pile of
     paper scraps from Somerset's pocket.  She picks up the piece of
     wallpaper with the pale red rose at its center.

                                 TRACY (CONT)
                   What is this?

     Somerset looks up.  Sees her holding the paper rose.  He takes
     it, slightly self-conscious, looks at it.

                                 SOMERSET
                   My future.

     Tracy tilts her head, looking at Somerset.

                                 TRACY
                   You have a strange way about you,
                   Somerset... I mean in a good way...
                   unusual.

     Somerset doesn't know what to say.  He pockets the paper rose.

                                 TRACY (CONT)
                   I apologize.  I'll get out of your hair.

     Tracy stands, takes the chair back to the kitchenette.

                                 TRACY (CONT)
                   It's just... it's nice to hear a man who
                   talks like that.  If David saw that
                   paper, he'd say you're acting like a
                   homosexual.  That's how he is.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (mock indignation)
                   Well!  I guess I won't be showing this to
                   him then.

                                 TRACY
                   I suppose not.

     Somerset continues writing.  Tracy sits at the kitchenette
     table, watches him.


     INSERT -- TITLE CARD

     THURSDAY

     EXT.  CITY MORGUE -- MORNING

     It's raining hard.  Mills exits the morgue building with a few
     art books and a paper cup of coffee.  He holds one art book over
     his head as he dashes through deep puddles in the street.

     INT.  MILLS' CAR -- MORNING

     Mills gets in, puts his coffee on the dash and tosses the art
     books in a box.  He closes the door.  Alone with the sound of
     the rain.  He wipes water off his face, looks at his tired eyes
     in the rearview mirror.

     He reaches in the box of books, takes out copies of The
     Canterbury Tales and Dante's Purgatory.  He makes a face, opens
     Dante's Purgatory:

     Mills turns to a bookmark, rests the book on the steering wheel.
     He reads.  He bites his lip, leaning close to the words.  He
     concentrates, mouths some of the words to himself.  He finally
     closes the book, shaking his head, not understanding anything
     he's reading.  He starts pounding the book against the steering
     wheel with all his might.

                                 MILLS
                   Fucking Dante.  Goddamn, poetry writing
                   freak, mother-fuck...

     A figure outside the window knocks on the glass.  Mills rolls it
     down.  A COP in raincoat hands a wet paper bag through.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Good work, Officer.  Good work.

     The cop leaves as Mills quickly rolls the window up and rips the
     bag open.  Inside: Cliff Notes for Dante's Purgatory and The
     Canterbury Tales.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Thank God.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- DAY

     It still rains outside.  Somerset enters, stops to notice
     DETECTIVE MILLS painted on the door where his name used to be.
     He walks, sees all his belongings have been moved from his desk
     and piled on a small temporary desk in the corner.

     Somerset sits at the temporary desk, starts organizing the files
     and papers.  Mills enters carrying the box of books.

                                 SOMERSET
                   How's it coming?

                                 MILLS
                   Great.

     Mills puts the box on the large desk.  They both settle in,
     attending to their work.  Two men, about five feet apart, each
     trying not to acknowledge the other's presence.

     Mills takes out his Cliff Notes, looks to see Somerset is
     occupied, hides them in a desk drawer.

     Somerset finishes one form, flips it and looks up.  There's a
     chalk board nailed to the wall.

     On the chalkboard:     1 gluttony(x)    5 wrath
                            2 greed(x)       6 pride
                            3 sloth          7 lust
                            4 envy

     The PHONE RINGS.  Both men look at it.  Phone RINGS again.

                                 SOMERSET
                   It's your name on the door.

     Mills picks up.  Somerset returns to his work.

                                 MILLS
                           (into phone)
                   Detective Mills here.
                           (lowers voice)
                   Honey, I asked you not to call unless...
                           (listens)
                   What... why?  Okay... okay.  Hold on.

     Mills is confused.  He holds the phone out to Somerset.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   It's my wife.

     Somerset looks quizzical.  Mills shrugs.  Somerset takes it.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (into phone)
                   Hello?
                           (listens)
                   Yes, well... I appreciate the thought,
                   but... I...
                           (listens)
                   Well, I guess I'd be delighted to.
                   Thank you... goodbye.

     Somerset gets up, hangs up, puzzled.  Mills is waiting.

                                 MILLS
                   Well?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'm invited to have a late supper with
                   you and your wife.  And I accept.

                                 MILLS
                   How's that?

                                 SOMERSET
                           (sits back down)
                   Tonight.

     Mills looks at the phone, lost.


     INT.  MILL'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- NIGHT

     A record player on a moving box PLAYS QUIET MUSIC.

     There's a basketball game with NO VOLUME on the t.v. screen.
     Tracy, Mills and Somerset eat at the kitchen table.  Mills has a
     beeper by his beer and occasionally fingers it absently.

                                 TRACY
                   Why aren't you married, Somerset?

                                 MILLS
                   Tracy.  What the hell?

     Somerset adjusts his napkin on his lap, thinking.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I was close.  It just didn't happen.

                                 TRACY
                   It surprises me you're not married.  It
                   really does.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Any person who spends a significant
                   amount of time with me finds me...
                   disagreeable.  Just ask your husband.

                                 MILLS
                   No argument.

     Mills grins, but he means it.  he sips beer.  The conversation
     lapses into long silence.  Somerset concentrates on his plate.
     Tracy looks at Mills, who eats while watching the basketball
     game.

                                 TRACY
                           (to Somerset)
                   How long have you lived here?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Too long.  Much too long.
                           (drinks)
                   What do you think of our fair city?

                                 TRACY
                   You take the bad with the good, I
                   suppose.  It's... it's...

                                 MILLS
                   It takes time to settle in.

     Tracy looks at Mills.  Somerset can see it is a sore subject.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (to Tracy)
                   You'll get used to it pretty quickly.
                   There are things in any big city that
                   stand out at first.  But...

     A LOW RUMBLING is HEARD as plates begin to rattle and clatter.

                                 TRACY
                   Subway train.  It's right below us/

     The dishes clatter more.  Coffee cups clink against their
     saucers.  Tracy holds her cup to stop it, tries to act like it
     is nothing, but she is clearly bothered.

                                 TRACY (CONT)
                   It'll go away in a minute.

     They wait.  The t.v. picture goes fuzzy.  The RUMBLING grows
     LOUDER, knocks something over in the sink.  Mills continues
     eating.  Somerset fiddles with his food.  The record player
     skips, then plays on.  The RUMBLING finally DIES DOWN, till
     everything is normal.

                                 MILLS
                           (uncomfortable)
                   This real estate guy... a real scum,
                   brought us to see this place a few
                   times.  And, it was nice enough, and the
                   price was right.  I was thinking it was
                   nothing, but I started to notice, he
                   kept hurrying us along.  I mean what
                   could it be?  Why would he only show it
                   like five minutes at a time, before he'd
                   hustle us out the door?

     Mills laughs, lamely.

                                 TRACY
                   We found out the first night.

     Somerset tries to stay straight, but he can't help laughing.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'm sorry... it's a nice apartment.

     He pulls himself together, but only for a moment.  He can't stop
     it, laughs harder, covering his mouth.  Tracy and Mills laugh.

                                 MILLS
                           (sighs)
                   Oh, fuck.

     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- LATER NIGHT

     The record player spins a different album, DIFFERENT MUSIC.
     Tracy's clearing the last dishes into the sink.  Mills and
     Somerset have beers.

                                 SOMERSET
                   All television does is teach children
                   that it's really cool to be stupid and
                   eat candy bars all day.

                                 TRACY
                   I don't think I've ever met anyone who
                   didn't have a television.

     Tracy takes a pot of coffee to the table and pours.

                                 MILLS
                   That's weird.  It's un-American.

     Somerset shrugs.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   What about sports?

                                 SOMERSET
                   What about them?

     Tracy brings over a plate of cookies and puts it on the table.

                                 MILLS
                   You go to movies at least.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I read.  Remember reading?  What's the
                   last book you read, Mills?

                                 MILLS
                   T.V. Guide.

     Mills laughs.  Burps.  he turns to Tracy.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Excuse me.
                           (to Somerset)
                   I just have to say, I can't respect any
                   man who's never seen Green Acres.

     Somerset gives a blank stare.  Tracy walks away.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   You've never seen The Odd Couple?  The
                   Flintstones?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I vaguely recall Wilma, and someone
                   named... Dino.

     Across the room, Tracy turns the t.v. and the record player off.
     She goes into the bedroom, shuts the door behind her without a
     word.  Somerset and Mills turn to the closed door.

     They look at each other, then sit for a time.  Somerset drinks
     coffee.  Mills drums his fingers on his beeper.  Big silence.


     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

     Mills walks up the creaky stairs.  He carries his briefcase, a
     six-pack and art books.  Somerset follows, reading a case file.

                                 MILLS
                   We think he acted like he was delivering
                   a package.  The doorman at Mr. Gold's
                   building says he doesn't even look at
                   anyone who goes in anymore.

     Mills opens a door to the roof --

     EXT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

     Mills and Somerset walk onto the roof.  It is a spectacular view
     on all sides.  Miles of city lights.  Breathtaking.  SOUNDS of
     the CITY reach them.

                                 SOMERSET
                   No connection between the two victims?

     Mills shakes his head, unloads what he's holding onto a rusty
     table.  He sits in one of two lawn chairs.  Somerset sits across
     from him.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   No witnesses of any kind?

                                 MILLS
                   None.  Which I can't understand.  It's
                   like this guy's invisible.


                                 SOMERSET
                   In this city, minding your own business
                   is a perfected science.

     Somerset takes a picture from the file, the drawing of the sun
     with an eye at its center.  He opens a book, CHRISTIAN SYMBOLS,
     which is full of illustrations.  He starts paging through.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   At the precinct, Sunday nights, they
                   offer a public crime prevention course.
                   And, the very first thing they teach is
                   that you should never scream "help" if
                   you're in trouble.  Scream "fire."
                   Because people don't want to get caught
                   up in anything.  But, a fire... that's
                   entertainment.  They come running.

     Somerset holds the books up to Mills, points to a picture of the
     sun and eye, same as the drawing Mills found.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   "The Sun in Splendor with the Eye."  It
                   refers to God the father, and to Saint
                   Thomas Aquinas.

                                 MILLS
                   Which saint is he?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Aquinas wrote a summary of theology,
                   Summa Theologica.  And he wrote about
                   the seven deadly sins.

     Mills takes the book and looks it over.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   Now, what else have you got?

                                 MILLS
                   Look, I appreciate being able to talk
                   this out, but... it's my case.

                                 SOMERSET
                   So... satisfying my curiosity.  I'm
                   still leaving town on Sunday.

     Mills is pondering, very tired.  He unlatches his briefcase,
     takes a photocopy of the photo of the falsely pretty woman and
     hands it to Somerset.

                                 MILLS
                   The eyes were circled.  With Mr. Gold's
                   blood.

                                 SOMERSET
                   This is his wife?

                                 MILLS
                           (nods)
                   She was away on business.  She got back
                   the day he was killed.  If this means
                   she saw anything, I don't know what.
                   We've questioned her about ten times.

                                 SOMERSET
                   And, if it's a threat?

                                 MILLS
                   We put her in a safe house.

                                 SOMERSET
                   This is the one thing.

                                 MILLS
                   I know.


     EXT.  SLUM TENEMENTS -- NIGHT

     Two twenty-story tenement buildings stand practically underneath
     the span of a bridge.  The streets are littered with garbage.
     Teenagers stand in cliques in front of a liquor store.  Cars
     pass slowly, CAR STEREOS PUMPING out HIP HOP.

     Under the bridge, in shadow, a car is parked between two
     dumpsters.  The trunk is open.

     AT THE BACK OF THE CAR

     The trunk is full of cardboard boxes which are in turn full of
     tall, orange candles.  Hundreds of candles.  JOHN leans in under
     the trunk's bulb, opens a leather pouch and checks the contents:

     A plastic bottle of prescription pills.  A bottle of aspirin.  A
     hypodermic needle filled with liquid.  Lastly, many jars of baby
     food: STRAINED CARROTS, STRAINED SPINACH, CREAMED CORN, etc.

     INT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

     John climbs the stairs holding the leather case and a closed
     shoebox.  He wears clip-on sunglasses, a hat pulled low, a thin
     overcoat on his plump body.

     INT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     John comes from the stairwell door, looks, walks up the hall.
     The walls are graffitied.  The soiled floor is wet in spots.
     ARGUMENTS and LOUD CHILDREN are HEARD from behind closed doors.
     John comes to apartment 303.  He's winded from the climb.  He
     takes out keys, lets himself in.  Closes the door.


     EXT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

     Somerset stands at the edge, holding the photo of Mrs. Gold.  He
     puffs on a cigarette, looks out at the city lights.

                                 SOMERSET
                   It's like he's preaching.
                           (pause)
                   The sins were used in medieval sermons.
                   There were seven cardinal virtues, and
                   then seven deadly sins, as a learning
                   tool.  The sins distract man from true
                   worship.  True faith.

     Mills is seated at the table with art books open.

     A breeze fans the pages of the books.  The flipping pages reveal
     views of heaven, hell, adoration, crucifixion and sin.

                                 MILLS
                   Like in these paintings, and in Dante's
                   Purgatory, right?  But, in Purgatory,
                   Dante and his buddy climb that big
                   mountain...

                                 SOMERSET
                   Seven Terraces of Purgation.

                                 MILLS
                   Anyway... pride comes first, not
                   gluttony.  And in all the paintings,
                   the sins are in a different order.  I
                   can't find a pattern.

                   Because there's creativity in the mix.
                   Consider these books as the murderer's
                   inspiration.  Or aspiration.

     Somerset drops his cigarette to the empty street, watching the
     glowing tip fall.  He looks at the woman's circled eyes.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   He sees himself contributing to the body
                   of Christian work.

                                 MILLS
                   He's punishing these people.

                                 SOMERSET
                   For all of us to see and learn from.
                   These murders are like forced attrition.

                                 MILLS
                   What?  Forced what?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Attrition.  When you regret your sins,
                   but not because you love God.

                                 MILLS
                   Because someone's holding a gun on you.

     Somerset thinks.  He walks from the edge to Mills.

                                 SOMERSET
                   When Mr. Gold's wife found the body,
                   about how long was she in the apartment?

                                 MILLS
                   She didn't find it.  The door to the
                   apartment was open and a neighbor...

                                 SOMERSET
                   I thought you said she found the body.
                   When she got back from a business trip.

                                 MILLS
                   No.  She got back after you and I had
                   already been there.

     Somerset thinks, coming up with something.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   What?

     Somerset holds up the photo of Mrs. Gold.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Maybe she is supposed to see
                   something... she just hasn't had a
                   chance to see it yet.


     INT.  SAFE HOUSE -- NIGHT

     The room is like a bland hotel room.  Mills stands beside MRS
     GOLD.  He shows her photos from the murder scene.  Mrs. Gold is
     crying.  Somerset stands across the room.

                                 MILLS
                   Please, look for anything strange or out
                   of place.  Anything at all.

                                 MRS GOLD
                   I... I don't understand.  Why now?

     Mills helps her go through the photos.  He is shaken himself,
     not wanting to put her through this.

                                 MILLS
                   I need your help if we're going to get
                   the guy who killed your husband.  If
                   there's anything in these pictures...

     Mrs. Gold sobs quietly, wipes her tears.

                                 MRS GOLD
                   I don't see anything.

                                 MILLS
                   Are you absolutely sure?

                                 MRS GOLD
                   I can't do this now... please.

                   I can't do this now... please.

     Mills looks at Somerset.  Somerset holds other photos.

                                 MILLS
                   We have to show her those.  There might
                   be something she's missing.

     Somerset looks at the photos in his hand, hesitant.  These
     photos show Mr. Gold's corpse, not covered in any way.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Have her look one last time.

                                 MRS GOLD
                   Wait.  Here... here's something...

                                 MILLS
                   What is it?

     Mrs. Gold points at the constructivist painting on the wall in
     one photo.  The painting is an abstraction of colored squares.

                                 MRS GOLD
                   This painting... in the living room...

                                 MILLS
                   What?

                                 MRS GOLD
                   Why is it hanging upside-down?

     Mills jerks his head to look at Somerset.  Big score.


     INT.  LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     This is where the greed murder took place.  Somerset and Mills
     are taking the constructivist painting off the wall.  Nothing on
     the wall behind the painting.  Blank space.

                                 MILLS
                   Nothing.

                                 SOMERSET
                   This has got to be it.

     Somerset puts the painting down, resting it on its bottom edge.
     The frame is backed by a thick sheet of brown paper.  He points
     to where the wire used to be screwed into the frame, and to
     where it has been re-screwed.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   It has to be.  He changed the wire to
                   rehang it.

     Somerset tears along the edge of the brown paper to get to the
     space between it and the canvas.  He tears out the entire sheet.
     Mills helps pull it away, but there's nothing there.  Empty.
     Mills looks at both sides of the paper, then tosses it away.

                                 MILLS
                   It's nothing.

     Somerset pays the painting down, face up.  He pokes his finger
     on the painted surface.  Mills watches as Somerset kneels, takes
     out a credit card and presses it's edge against the canvas,
     trying to peel up some of the paint.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Give it up.  The killer didn't paint the
                   fucking thing.

     Somerset pushes the painting away, stands, frustrated.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   He fucked us.

     Somerset backs away from the wall, staring at the space where
     the painting hung.  There is only a nail.  He stares intently,
     then turns and walks out of the room.

     Mills holds his hands to his temples, furious.  SOMERSET can be
     HEARD from the other room, going through drawers, dropping
     things.  GLASS is HEARD BREAKING.  Mills grabs a lamp and throws
     it on the floor.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Son of a bitch!

     Somerset comes back in, holding something.  He steps over the
     lamp and goes to the blank wall space.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   What?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Bear with me.

     Mills watches.  Somerset has a woman's make-up compact in hand.
     He opens it, uses the soft brush to begin applying the red rouge
     powder to the wall around the nail.

                                 MILLS
                           (incredulous)
                   Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Shut up and wait!

     Somerset brushes with wider strokes.  He blows, leans very close
     to the wall to study the powder.  Leans closer still.  Pause.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   Call the print lab.  Now.


     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Tracy is asleep with lights on.  She stirs, opens her eyes.

     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT -- NIGHT

     Tracy opens the door, enters.  It's quiet.  She sees Mills and
     Somerset are gone.  She's all alone.  Unhappy.

     EXT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, FIRE ESCAPE -- NIGHT

     Through the window, we can see into the bedroom.  Tracy comes
     back from the living room.  She goes to her side of the bed,
     kneels.  She reaches between the mattress and bedspring, takes
     out a paperback book she has hidden there.

     She comes to the window, opens it and climbs out onto the fire
     escape.  She sits, dangles her feet through the metal bars.  She
     opens the book and tries to read by the street light, resting
     her head against the railing.  A WOMAN is HEARD SCREAMING
     distantly.

     Tracy looks down the empty street, unsettled.  The woman is not
     heard again.

     Tracy lays back, looks at the sky, holding herself.  We can now
     see the title of the book: PREPARING FOR PARENTHOOD.  There is a
     picture of a baby on the cover.

     Tracy cries, quietly.


     INT.  LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

     A MALE FORENSIC uses a magnifying glass to study a very clear
     fingerprint in black powder on the wall.

                                 FORENSIC
                   Oh, boy...

                                 MILLS (O.S.)
                   Talk to me.

     The forensic bites his lip, still studying.

     Mills and Somerset watch the forensic who works offscreen.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                           (to Somerset)
                   Listen, honestly... have you ever seen
                   anything like this?  Been involved in
                   anything remotely like this?

                                 SOMERSET
                   No.  I have not.

                                 FORENSIC (O.S.)
                   Well, I can tell you this, detectives...

     The forensic steps down from a stool.  Behind him, where the
     painting once was, there are fingerprints, clear and distinct.
     The prints have been left side by side, to form letters which
     form the words: HELP ME.

                                 FORENSIC (CONT)
                   ...just by studying the underloop...
                   these are not the victim's prints.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, PRINT LAB -- NIGHT

     Dark.  A TECHNICIAN sits before an old computer.  The computer's
     green screen shows fingerprints being aligned, compared and then
     rejected; whir - click - whir - click - whir - click.  Mills and
     Somerset watch, bathed in the green glow.

                                 SOMERSET
                   It doesn't work for me.  I can't believe
                   he wants us to help him stop.

                                 MILLS
                   Who the hell knows?  There's plenty of
                   schizoids out there doing dirty deeds
                   they don't want to do.  With tiny voices
                   whispering nasty things in their ears.

     Somerset doesn't buy it.  The technician adjusts a knob.

                                 TECHNICIAN
                   I've seen this baby take three days to
                   finish a cycle, so you guys can go cross
                   your fingers somewhere else.

     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     Somerset and Mills come from the print lab.  A janitor is
     mopping the hall.  The computer is HEARD WHIRRING AND CLICKING
     onwards.  Somerset sits with a groan on a couch outside the
     door.  Mills flops beside him.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You really meant what you said to Mrs.
                   Gold.  You really believe we'll get him,
                   don't you?

                                 MILLS
                   And you don't?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I wish I still thought like you.  I'm so
                   far gone from that.

                                 MILLS
                   So, tell me what you think we're doing.

                                 SOMERSET
                   All we do is pick up the pieces.  We
                   take all the evidence... all the
                   pictures, statements.  Write everything
                   down and note what time things happened.
                   We take it all, make a nice, neat pile
                   and file it away.  Just in case it's
                   ever needed in a courtroom.

                                 MILLS
                   You're unbelievable.  In my entire life,
                   you're the oldest man I've ever met.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I've seen even the most promising clues
                   lead to dead ends.  Hundreds of times.

                                 MILLS
                   I've seen the same.  I'm not the country
                   hick-boy you seem to think I am.

     Somerset takes out a cigarette and lights it.

                                 SOMERSET
                   In this city, if all the skeletons came
                   out of all the closets... if every un-
                   revenged corpse were to suddenly rise
                   and walk again, there would be no more
                   room for the living.

     Mills slumps back, crosses his arms, closes his eyes to sleep.

                                 MILLS
                   Don't try to tell me you didn't get that
                   rush tonight... that adrenalin.  Like we
                   were getting somewhere.
                           (pause)
                   And, don't try to tell me it was because
                   you thought we found something that
                   would play well in a courtroom.

     Somerset looks at Mills, puffs the cigarette.  The computer is
     heard: whir - click - whir - click...


     INSERT -- TITLE CARD

     FRIDAY

     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, HALLWAY -- EARLY MORNING

     Our detectives are fast asleep on the couch, leaning against
     each other.  People pass and look at them strangely.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Wake up, Glimmer Twins.  We have a
                   winner.

     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, READY ROOM -- EARLY MORNING

     A windowless classroom.  The captain stands in front with a
     white screen at his side.  The face of a black man, 25, ZERO, is
     projected on the screen from a slide projector.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   His street name is Zero, as some of you
                   know.  His prints were found at the
                   scene by Detectives Mills and Somerset.

     FIVE hardened POLICE OFFICERS, four men, one woman, sit in
     chairs facing the captain.  They all wear bullet-proof vests
     with "POLICE" stencil-painted across them.  Somerset and Mills
     sit in back, drinking coffee, still trying to wake up.

                                 CAPTAIN (CONT)
                   Now, Zero has a long, long history of
                   mental illness.  Serious illness.  He
                   was all over your television sets two
                   years ago after he raped and killed a
                   seventy-three year old woman.  He got
                   off, as the saying goes, on a
                   technicality.  So we watched him on the
                   streets, and he went out of circulation
                   about a year ago.

                                 FEMALE COP
                   If he disappeared, what do you want from
                   us?

                                 CAPTAIN
                   His last place of residence is still in
                   his name.  A search warrant is being
                   pushed through the court as we speak.

     A red-headed cop, CALIFORNIA, 28, raises his meaty hand.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   So, have the housing cops walk up and
                   ring the doorbell.  Problem solved.

     The cops laugh.  The captain clenches his jaw.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Listen, California.  When you go in, if
                   Zero isn't home, some of his buddies
                   might be house-sitting.  And besides
                   using, Zero deals, so, you will be very
                   uninvited guests.

     There is chatter among the cops.  Somerset leans to Mills while
     the captain continues the briefing.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Does not seem like our killer, does it?

                                 MILLS
                   You tell me.  I'm new in town.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Zero does possess the requisite degree
                   of insanity... but, he doesn't have the
                   desire somehow.  Our killer seems to
                   have more purpose.  More purpose than
                   Zero could ever conceive of.

                                 MILLS
                   We'll tag along.

     Somerset wants no part of that.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Why would we?

                                 MILLS
                   Satisfy our curiosity?


     INT.  MILLS' CAR -- MORNING

     Mills drives, follows a police van.  Somerset rides shotgun.
     Mills is pumped, ready.  Somerset takes one Rolaids tablet off a
     fresh roll and chews it.

                                 MILLS
                   You ever take one?

     Somerset pulls out his gun, checks the load.

                                 SOMERSET
                   No.  Never in twenty-four years.  I took
                   my gun out only five times with the
                   actual intention of using it.  I never
                   fired it.  Not once.

                                 MILLS
                   I pulled it once, fired it once.  I
                   never took a bullet.

                                 SOMERSET
                   And?

     Mills turns a corner, tires screeching.

                                 MILLS
                   It was my first one of these.  We were a
                   secondary unit, in vice.  I was pretty
                   shaky going in.  When we busted the
                   door, looking for a junkie, the fucking
                   guy opened fire.  One cop was hit in the
                   arm.  He went flying... like in slow
                   motion.
                           (pause)
                   I remember riding in the ambulance.  His
                   arm was like... a piece of meat.  I
                   thought, it's just his arm.  But, he
                   bled to death right there anyway.

     A pause.  Somerset opens the window, feels the air on his face.

                                 SOMERSET
                   How did the fire-fight end?

                                 MILLS
                   Well, I was doing really good in Philly
                   up till then.  Lots of simple busts.
                   I've always had this weird luck... but,
                   this was wild.
                           (pause)
                   I got that fuck with one shot... right
                   between the eyes.  And the next week,
                   the mayor's pinning a medal on me.
                   Picture in the paper, the whole nine
                   yards.

                                 SOMERSET
                   How was it?

                                 MILLS
                   I expected it to be bad, because I heard
                   about other guys.  You know... I took a
                   human life.  But, I slept like a baby
                   that night.

     Somerset eats another antacid.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I
                   can't remember where, but he wrote that,
                   in order to live in a city, you have to
                   have the ability to kill.  I think he
                   meant you truly must be able to do it,
                   not just faking it, to survive.

                                 MILLS
                   Sounds like he knew what he was talking
                   about.


     INT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- MORNING

     Crack vials and hypodermic needles crunch under heavy boots.

     The five cops from the briefing, fully geared up, rifles and
     handguns held, move quickly up the stairs, single-file.
     Somerset and Mills follow, guns out.  Somerset is sweating
     bullets.  Mills is juiced.

     INT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- MORNING

     The cops enter the dank hallway, the same hall we saw John in
     before.  They move cautiously, stepping over a drunken, helpless
     man.  A door opens and a woman peeks out.  The female cop points
     her gun and the woman obeys, slamming the door.

     California leads, steps up to apartment 303.  He has a search
     warrant scotch-taped to the front of his bullet-proof vest.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                           (to black cop)
                   This is it.  Give it up.

     A black cop hoists a battering ram.  The other cops get on both
     sides of the door.  Mills moves front.  Somerset hangs back.

                                 CALIFORNIA (CONT)
                   Police!!  Open the door!

     The black cop brings the ram forward with a splintering thud.
     The door flies open.  The cops storm in.

     INT.  SLUM APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- MORNING

     The cops charge down a short hall into this incredibly dusty
     room.  A bed sits against a far wall.  Mills and California move
     up to the bed.  Someone lies under an indigo blanket.  Three
     other cops move, training their weapons on the bed.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   Good morning, Sweetheart!

     A blond cop goes into another room.  Mills kicks the bed.

                                 MILLS
                   Get up now, motherfucker!  Now!

     INT.  SLUM APARTMENT, ADJOINING ROOM -- MORNING

     The blond cop enters, gun trained, looks around in confusion.

     The room's tables, chairs and floor are covered with hundreds of
     colorful, plastic air fresheners.

     INT.  SLUM APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- MORNING

     Somerset moves in, looks around.  He notices the area around the
     bed, the ceiling, walls and floor, has been painted indigo,
     while the rest of the room is its original white.  On a wall, a
     white sheet is pinned up with a square drawn on it in excrement.

                                 MILLS
                   I said get up, Sleepyhead!

     Mills pulls the indigo blanket off the bed, reveals the
     shriveled, sore-covered form of a black man who is blindfolded
     and tied to the bed with a thin wire wrapped time and time again
     around the bed.  Tubes lead from the stained loincloth around
     the man's waist and snake under the bed.  The victim is
     partially covered by what seem to be piles of black spaghetti.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   Oh, fuck me!

     Somerset pushes past the cops who recoil from the stench.

                                 MILLS
                   Holy shit.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Sloth... it's sloth.

     The black cop touches the black spaghetti.  Holds a piece.

                                 BLACK COP
                   What the hell... those are dead worms.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                           (to Somerset)
                   Check this out, dick.

     California points with his gun to the end of the black man's
     right arm.  The hand is gone, severed at the wrist long ago.

                                 MILLS
                   It's him.  It's Zero.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Someone call an ambulance.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   Someone call a hearse, more like.

     The female cop has gone to the wall where the sheet is pinned
     up.  She pulls the sheet aside and finds: fifty-two polaroid
     pictures; all pictures of Zero tied to the bed, with a date
     written at the bottom of each.  it is a visual history of Zero's
     physical decay.  The blond cop enters from the other room.

                                 BLOND COP
                   What the fuck is going on?

                                 MILLS
                   Hey, California.  Get your people out.

     Somerset takes out rubber gloves and puts them on.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   You heard him.  Hit the hall, and don't
                   touch anything.

     The other cops file out as Mills goes to examine the polaroids
     under the sheet.  Somerset replaces the sheet over Zero's body.
     California stays by his side.

                                 CALIFORNIA (CONT)
                   It looks like he's some kind of friggin'
                   wax sculpture.

     Somerset places his finger along Zero's throat.

                                 MILLS
                   Somerset, you... you better look here.

     Mills studies the polaroids.  Somerset walks to join him.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   All pictures of Zero tied to the bed.
                           (crouches)
                   The last one's dated three days ago.

     Somerset looks at the first photo.  In it, Zero is bound and
     gagged, but he is fit, healthy.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (awed)
                   The first photo... it's dated one year
                   ago.  Almost to the day.

     California lifts Zero's blanket to peek under, examining with
     morbid curiosity.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   Mo-ther...

     Mills kneels and lifts the bottom of the sheet off the floor,
     finds an open shoebox.  On the box: TO THE DETECTIVES.

                                 MILLS
                   What's this?

     California leans close to Zero's gaunt, blindfolded face.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   You got what you deserved, Zero.

     Somerset leans down beside Mills.  Mills looks through the
     shoebox.  Inside are plastic, zip-lock bags.  One bag contains
     small clumps of hair, one contains a yellow liquid...

                                 MILLS
                   A urine sample... hair sample...
                   fingernail clippings.  He's laughing at
                   us.

     California is still close to Zero's face when suddenly Zero's
     lips twist.  Zero lets out a loud, guttural bark.  California
     jerks back in fear, shouting, falling over a chair.

     Mills and Somerset reel, standing.  They see California on the
     ground, scared out of his mind, pointing.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   He's alive!

     Mills and Somerset look towards the bed.

     Zero's lips move feebly as he lets out a sick, gurgling moan.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   He's still alive!


     EXT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING -- MORNING

     A crowd has gathered.  Mills' car, the police van and two
     ambulances are parked on the sidewalk.

     INT.  SLUM APARTMENT, HALLWAY -- MORNING

     The siege cops are in the hall, holding neighbors at bay.

     INT.  SLUM APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- MORNING

     Three ambulance attendants are at the bed, working on Zero.  One
     attendant uses wire-cutters to clip Zero's bonds.

     INT.  SLUM TENEMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- MORNING

     Mills and Somerset stand in the middle of one flight of stairs.
     They are both highly agitated.

                                 SOMERSET
                   The way this has gone, I didn't think it
                   was possible, but we may have
                   underestimated this guy.  The type of
                   intestinal fortitude it must take... to
                   keep a man bound for a full year.  To
                   sever his hand and use it to plant
                   fingerprints.

                                 MILLS
                   I want him bad.  I don't just want to
                   catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Listen... we have to divorce ourselves
                   from our emotions here.  We have to keep
                   focusing on the small details.

                                 MILLS
                   I don't know about you, Somerset, but I
                   feed off my emotions.

                                 SOMERSET
                   He'll string us along all the way if
                   we're not careful.

     Mills is looking at the floor, burning with anger.  Somerset
     grabs him by the jacket.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   Are you listening to me?!

     Mills pushes Somerset's hand off.

                                 MILLS
                   I hear you.

     There is a sudden brilliant flash of light and the SOUND of a
     CAMERA ADVANCING.  Mills and Somerset look --

     Down the stairs, John is posing as a reporter.  He has his
     camera and flash up, pointed at the detectives.

                                 JOHN
                   Say cheese.

     He takes another picture, flashbulb flashing.  Mills charges
     downwards, grabs John by his wrinkled clothing.

                                 MILLS
                   What the fuck are you doing?

     John squirms, holds up a laminated PRESS identification pass.

                                 JOHN
                   I have a right, Officer.  I...

     Mills shoves him and John stumbles a few steps, then falls to
     the landing below with a thud.  His glasses fly off.

                                 MILLS
                   That doesn't mean anything.  This is a
                   closed crime scene now!

     Somerset steps down and pulls Mills back.  John stands.

                                 JOHN
                   You can't do this!  You can't...

                                 MILLS
                   Get the fuck out of here!

     John gets his glasses, scrambles downstairs, out of sight.

                                 JOHN (O.S.)
                   The public has a right to know!

     Somerset yanks Mills harder, till Mills sits on the stairs.

                                 MILLS
                   How do those cockroaches get here so
                   quick?

                                 SOMERSET
                   They pay cops for the inside scoop, and
                   they pay well.  You can hate them, but
                   you better give them something, or
                   they'll make it all up.

                                 MILLS
                           (calming)
                   I'm sorry... I just...

                                 SOMERSET
                   Oh, it's alright.  It's always
                   impressive to see a man feeding off his
                   emotions.


     INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

     Mills stands with the blase DR. BEARDSLEY, who reviews a medical
     chart on a clipboard.  Zero lies inside an oxygen tent with
     tubes running into him.  The room is dark.

                                 BEARDSLEY
                   A year of immobility seems about right,
                   judging by the deterioration of the
                   muscles and spinal cord.  Blood tests
                   show a whole smorgasbord of drugs in his
                   system.  Heroin... crack... even an
                   antibiotic which was administered to
                   keep the bed sores from infecting.

     Mills looks into the oxygen.

                                 MILLS
                   He hasn't said anything, or tried to
                   express himself in any way?

                                 BEARDSLEY
                   Even if his brain were not mush, which
                   it is... he chewed his own tongue off a
                   long time ago.

     Mills winces, moves away from the bed.

                                 MILLS
                   There's no way he'll survive?

                                 BEARDSLEY
                   Detective, he'd die right now of shock
                   if you were to shine a flashlight in his
                   eyes.


     EXT.  CITY STREET, CATHOLIC CHURCH -- AFTERNOON

     A tall church on a bustling street.  Smoggy air has eaten at the
     stonework.  The homeless are camped out on the stairs.

     INT.  CATHOLIC CHURCH, PRIEST'S QUARTERS -- AFTERNOON

     The priest's accommodations are quite spacious and comfortable.
     The parish's wealth is evident.  FATHER BLEEKER, 38, stands
     looking at several 8" by 10" glossies.  He's dressed in his
     "civilian" clothing, wears his hair short and proper.  These
     photos are making him heartsick.

     Bleeker hands them to Somerset who is seated by a fireplace.

                                 BLEEKER
                   Put them away.  I wish you hadn't
                   brought them into the church.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I needed for you to see them.

     Father Bleeker shakes his head, as if he were trying to forget
     the images.  Somerset replaces the murder photos in a file.

                                 BLEEKER
                   There were five principal phases in the
                   development of early Christian art.
                   From Hellenistic through the
                   Renaissance... each period was affected
                   by the decrees of religious leaders.

                                 SOMERSET
                   If this killer belongs to a certain
                   branch of the church... if he collects
                   religious art from a certain period, I
                   want to know.  I have to narrow it down.

     Bleeker walks to an ornate, gold cabinet.  He puts on a pair of
     cotton gloves.

                                 BLEEKER
                   The influences on these... things he's
                   done, couldn't have come before the
                   Gothic period.  What's in those pictures
                   is presented far too asymmetrically.

     Bleeker crosses himself before using a key to open the cabinet.
     He takes out an ancient devotional book and a piece of cloth.

                                 BLEEKER (CONT)
                   The colors will tell the tale.

     Bleeker takes the book to a table.  Somerset follows.  Bleeker
     lays the cloth under the book, opens the book, tenderly.

                                 BLEEKER (CONT)
                   Each sin had a symbolic color.  But the
                   specific color designations changed
                   throughout the ages.

     Somerset leans to examine Bleeker's illuminated manuscript:

     Two pages of prayer.  The prose is elaborately formed,
     surrounded by colorful illustrations of the seven deadly sins.
     Bleeker's finger points to a rendering of a man seated on a
     rock, guzzling from a jug.  It's been painted in orange.

                                 BLEEKER (O.S.,CONT)
                   This is an example.  Gluttony is the
                   sin, and the color is orange.  This
                   particular manuscript is preserved from
                   the 18th century.

                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)
                   In the murders, gluttony is green.
                   Greed is yellow.  Sloth is indigo.

     Bleeker steps away and Somerset gets closer to the pages.

                                 BLEEKER
                   So, if this murderer is as precise as
                   you say, then you need to find out at
                   what period in history was gluttony
                   green... and so on.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Where do I look?  If the colors changed
                   so often?

                                 BLEEKER
                           (contemplates)
                   There is one man... Father Stone.
                           (pause)
                   I haven't heard from him for quite some
                   time.  This was his passion.  He spent
                   his life studying the sins... and
                   preaching against them.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

     The chalkboard on the wall:  1 gluttony (x)       5 wrath
                                  2 greed (x)          6 pride
                                  3 sloth (x)          7 lust
                                  4 envy

     Mills is behind his paperwork covered desk, listening to a
     uniformed OFFICER who looks over a report sheet.

                                 OFFICER
                   Zero's landlord said an envelope of cash
                   was in the office mailbox each month.
                   He says, quote, "I never heard a single
                   complaint from this guy and nobody ever
                   complained about him.  He's the best
                   tenant I ever had."

                                 MILLS
                   There's a landlord's dream tenant.  A
                   paralyzed man with no tongue.

                                 OFFICER
                   Who pays his rent on time.

                                 MILLS
                   Bring me everything as soon as it's
                   transcribed.

     The officer leaves.  Mills starts sorting through piles on his
     desk.  He doesn't know where to begin.

     He sits back in his chair, looks at the collage-like collection
     of pictures pinned on the walls: photos and diagrams of the
     murder scenes, the drawing of the sun and eye, color pages and
     black and white copies of pages from art books.

     He stares, thinking.  He stands, takes a photocopy off the wall.
     The killer's first note:

              Dear Detectives,
                   Long is the way, and hard, that out
                   of hell leads up to the light.

                                 MILLS
                           (to himself)
                   Milton.


     INT.  CENTRAL LIBRARY -- AFTERNOON

     Big brass lamps hang from the high ceiling.  Mahogany chairs and
     tables run down the center floor which is bordered by three
     levels of balconies.  People wander like ants in an ant farm.

     Mills walks, taking it all in.  He goes to the circulation desk.
     Impatient patrons wait in a long line.  He watches the bored
     HEAD LIBRARIAN, female, 64, help an old man at the desk.

     She opens the old man's books, runs a laser pen over a bar code
     sticker, pushes a few buttons on a computer.

     INT.  CENTRAL LIBRARY, TOP BALCONY -- LATER AFTERNOON

     Near the balcony railing, overlooking the main floor, Mills sits
     before a computer card catalog.  He reads the computer screen,
     unsure.  He sets down his pad and pencil, cracks his knuckles,
     begins typing on the keyboard.  The computer gives off a quiet
     BEEP.  Pleased, Mills reads the screen.  Types.

     On the screen:                 TITLE / PARADISE LOST_

     He hits return.  Reads the screen as information on the book
     appears.  He copies it on his pad, puts the pencil in his mouth.

     He types.  On the screen:      SUBJECT / JACK THE RIPPER_

     Hits return.  Again, he copies info from the screen.


     INT.  INNER CITY CLOISTER -- AFTERNOON

     A monk opens a formidable gateway door, letting Father Bleeker
     and Somerset into a garden courtyard.  Bleeker now wears his
     priestly garb and collar.  The monastery's main building looms
     at the end of a pathway.  The building is stately, ivy-covered.

                                 BLEEKER
                   Father Stone had a church and
                   congregation of his own.  But, he...
                   there were some problems.  The church is
                   deserted now.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Problems?

     Bleeker continues walking.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   Father?

     INT.  INNER CITY CLOISTER, HALLWAY -- AFTERNOON

     The walls of the hallway are carved with images of saints.
     Bleeker whispers to Somerset beside a windowless door.

                                 BLEEKER
                   There was a small orphanage attached to
                   the church, overseen by Father Stone.
                   This was almost thirty years ago.
                           (hesitant)
                   He was an excellent priest, devoted in
                   every way.  Many in his parish demanded
                   his return.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Tell me what happened.

     Bleeker sees a NUN down the hall, coming towards them.

                                 BLEEKER
                   Allegations were made... Stone was
                   accused of abusing the children in his
                   care.  But, those charges were never
                   substantiated.

                                 SOMERSET
                   What abuse?

                                 BLEEKER
                   It was claimed... that the children were
                   beaten.  And, punished severely.

     The nun is too close for Bleeker to speak freely.

     INT.  INNER CITY CLOISTER, STONE'S ROOM -- AFTERNOON

     The door is unlocked and opened by the nun.  Somerset enters and
     Bleeker waits outside as the nun closes the door.  It's dark.

     FATHER STONE, 73, is in a wheelchair.  Feeble and frail, eyes
     sunken in their sockets.  He looks up at Somerset.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Father Stone.  I'm a policeman.  I'd
                   like to ask you a few questions, if it's
                   alright?

     The whites of Stone's eyes have yellowed.  He seems to nod.
     Somerset sits on a stool, close.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   I want to ask you about the seven deadly
                   sins.

                                 STONE
                   The sins.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Yes, father.

     Stone reaches out a hand to touch Somerset's face.  Stone's
     extremely long fingernails trail against Somerset's cheek and
     Somerset tries to hide his revulsion.

                                 STONE
                   Are you one of mine?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I don't...

                                 STONE
                   Are you saved?  Do you have God?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I... I need to ask about the sins.  Do
                   you understand what I'm saying?

     Stone takes his hand away, seems to be getting angry.

                                 STONE
                   Are you a sinner?

     Stone's weak arms wheel him away, towards a corner.

                                 STONE (CONT)
                   There are sinners here.  Even here.
                   And, pain waits for them.  Hell is
                   hungry for them.

     Stone bites his lip, moaning, disoriented.

                                 STONE (CONT)
                   They don't realize... they don't know.
                           (pause)
                   Fuck them all!

     Somerset is shocked by the strength and volume of Stone's jagged
     voice.  The nun goes to place a comforting hand on Stone's
     shoulder.  Stone is beginning to cry.

                                 NUN
                           (to Somerset)
                   They shouldn't have let you disturb him.
                   This shouldn't have been allowed.

                                 STONE
                   Where are the children?
                           (much louder)
                   Where are the children?!


     INT.  CENTRAL LIBRARY, OUTSIDE LIBRARIAN'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

     From a mahogany hallway lined with book-carts, we look THROUGH a
     big WINDOW into the head librarian's office.  The elderly head
     librarian is at a computer, chain-smoking, working the keyboard.
     Mills alternates talking on the telephone and reading things off
     his pad to the librarian.

     We cannot hear them, but it's clear Mills is excited as he walks
     back and forth, hovering over the librarian, looking at her
     computer screen, making suggestions, then walking to monitor a
     dot-matrix printer which spews a waterfall of computer paper
     onto the floor.  Back and forth goes Mills, carrying the phone.
     He closes the pad, puts it in his pocket.

     The librarian finishes typing, sits back, done.  Mills hangs up
     the phone, goes to put it on the librarian's desk, but the cord
     drags, knocks a pile of books off a table.

     The librarian is irritated, goes to pick up the books.  Mills is
     apologizing.  He goes to watch the printer.  He tears the last
     sheet's perforated edge, gathers the huge pile of printed paper
     off the floor.

     Prize in hand, Mills is so grateful he bends to give the old
     woman a kiss on the cheek, but she pushes him away, now even
     more annoyed.  Mills goes to leave, knocks over another pile of
     books.  Before he can assist, the angry librarian points to the
     door.  Mills obeys like a scolded child, exits.

     The librarian shakes her head in disgust.


     EXT.  ABANDONED CHURCH/ORPHANAGE -- AFTERNOON

     A once exemplary church, now boarded up, neglected.  Gothic in
     style, it stands with deserted brownstones and empty lots of
     rubble as neighbors.  Smokestacks spew smoke distantly.  Cars
     and trucks drive by on a nearby elevated highway, but down here
     on the street it's a ghost town.

     There's a building attached to the rear of the church.
     Somerset's car is parked beside it.

     INT.  ABANDONED ORPHANAGE, CLASSROOM -- AFTERNOON

     The windows are covered over.  Somerset and Father Bleeker move
     through.  Somerset has a flashlight with a wide beam.  The room
     is empty except for broken, cob-web covered school desks and a
     few file cabinets.  There are cracked blackboards on the walls.
     Rats skitter away from the light.

     Somerset opens a file cabinet drawer.  It's empty.  He walks to
     a door, starts pulling at the rotting boards which seal it shut.

                                 BLEEKER
                   What are you looking for?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'm just looking.

     INT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- AFTERNOON

     Somerset pushes the door.  He and Bleeker enter from the
     classroom into the far back corner of the church.  Big church.
     Shafts of colored light needle through the holes in the pieces
     of wood and cloth that cover the broken stained glass windows.

     Somerset walks down the center aisle between deteriorated pews.
     rats run.  Pigeons flap about, dirt drifting off their wings.

     Somerset shines his flashlight forward to the rather barren
     altar.  To the right, at the top of the altar stairs, there is a
     stone statue of a saint with his arms outstretched, welcoming.

     The life-size saint is covered in spider-webs.  Tiny spiders
     crawl across his eyes, which look down on Somerset.

                                 BLEEKER
                   Saint Jerome Emiliani.  The patron saint
                   of orphans.

     Somerset shines the flashlight against the back altar wall,
     revealing a wooden carving of Christ crucified.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Is this still the Lord's house?

                                 BLEEKER
                   Of course it is.

                                 SOMERSET
                   And, even if Father Stone was guilty of
                   everything... if he was hurting children
                   here?  It's still the Lord's house?

     Father Bleeker finds this talk insulting and offensive.

                                 BLEEKER
                   You have no faith, Somerset?  Have you
                   given up on the church entirely?

                                 SOMERSET
                   No.
                           (pause)
                   That's not what I've given up on.

     Somerset notices two ends of a thick rope suspended from the
     ceiling above the center of the altar.  He looks up, following
     the rope with the flashlight, when he notices something else.
     His mouth drops.  Bleeker looks, and is equally horrified.

     Above them, in the beam of light: seven large paintings on
     panels tilted forward at the curve of the ceiling above the
     altar.  Seven ancient paintings; seven deadly sins.

     The beam of light moves to the panel to the immediate right: a
     painting of a man kneeling, grasping at gold coins all around
     him.  The man is naked, as was the victim of the greed murder.
     The chief color in this panel is a vulgar yellow.

     The third in the series is sloth.  The painting, in indigo,
     shows a man at rest in a pliant bed.  The skeletal man's eyes
     are rolled up in their sockets.  He is covered in slimy worms.


     EXT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- LATE AFTERNOON

     The streets are full of patrol cars.  Cops and forensics enter
     and exit the church from various doorways.  Saw-horses are
     loaded off a flat-bed truck as a police barricade is erected.

     INT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Much activity, as forensics with flashlights go about their
     business, checking every nook and cranny of the church, looking
     for any sign that someone's been here recently.  Small temporary
     floodlights are hoisted on tripods.

     Two photographers stand at the tops of tall ladders.  Flash-
     photo after flash-photo is taken of the seven paneled tableau.

     Near the open church doors, Mills speaks with great animation,
     holding his ream of computer paper.  Somerset looks at the altar
     and the tableau, preoccupied.

                                 MILLS
                   Our guy's a bookworm, right?  And, I
                   know it's a long shot, but you have to
                   give a picture id and current phone bill
                   to get a library card.  Hey...

     Mills snaps his fingers in Somerset's face, gets his attention.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   I made two separate lists of books.  One
                   relating to the sins... Dante's
                   Purgatory, Canterbury Tales... The
                   Dictionary of Catholicism... all the
                   religious stuff.  The second list was
                   books about torture methods, mass
                   murderers... sadomasochism.  Whatever
                   our killer might study to do the things
                   he's done.  Whatever his other interests
                   are.

     Somerset takes the computer list.

                                 SOMERSET
                   So, what is this?

                                 MILLS
                   Alright.  Everything at the library goes
                   into a computer.  So, you can get in the
                   system and cross-reference...

     Mills fumbles in his pocket, takes out his pad and reads.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Let's say you take, Dante's Purgatory,
                   call number eight-five-one-D, and... The
                   Biography of the Marquis de Sade,
                   ninety-two S-A-D-E.  Put those books in
                   the system, and the computer can give
                   you the name of anyone who's ever taken
                   out both those books.  And, it doesn't
                   just give you their name and address, it
                   gives you a complete history of their
                   library reading habits.

     Mills slaps the list in Somerset's hand.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                           (psyched up)
                   If somebody's out there reading Paradise
                   Lost and studying The Life and Times of
                   Charlie Manson, I want to talk to them.

     Somerset looks up from the list, warming to it.  He starts
     looking around, searching for someone.

     EXT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Somerset and Mills exit down the stairs.  Somerset's still
     searching, holding the list.  He spies a uniformed cop, DARIO.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Dario!  Come here.

     Dario runs up.  Somerset puts his hand on his shoulder and makes
     him walk with him.  Mills continues on to his car.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   According to the Father, this orphanage
                   wasn't around for more than five or six
                   years in the late fifties.  So, I want
                   someone to go to the Department of Child
                   Welfare or City Hall and dig up all the
                   records on this place.  Understand?

                                 DARIO
                   I got it.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Get a list of every child who attended
                   this orphanage before it shut down.  Get
                   it on my desk within the hour.

     Somerset releases Dario, who runs to obey.  Somerset goes to his
     own car.  Mills is driving to leave, stops, revs the engine.
     Somerset hands the computer list through the window.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   You thought of this all by yourself?
                   This was your brainstorm?

                                 MILLS
                   Yeah.  Is that so hard for you to
                   believe?

                                 SOMERSET
                   It's a pleasant surprise.

                                 MILLS
                   I'm not as stupid as I look.

     Mills peels away.  Somerset heads to his own car.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (to himself)
                   I guess not.


     INT.  SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING

     Seven large photos hang with the other materials on the wall:

     The seven tableau paintings.  Gluttony, greed and sloth,
     followed by vanity.  Vanity shows a woman standing in front of a
     mirror, staring at her image.  The floor around her is scattered
     with flowers.  The primary color is violet, and as in all the
     paintings, there is a quality of ugliness in the character.

                                 MILLS (O.S.)
                   Ramirez.  Manuel Ramirez.

                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)
                   No... I don't see any Ramirez.

     The lust painting is next.  It shows a man standing over a
     woman.  The woman is nude, under a sheet, and the man's features
     are bizarre, lecherous.  He wants that woman.  There are apples
     on the floor and on the bed.  The color is red.

                                 MILLS (O.S.)
                   Elinski.  Dennis Elinski.

                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)
                   No.

     Envy is particularly gruesome.  The Devil is seen hovering in
     the air, wearing a crown, his body orange and slick, wrapped in
     a cloak of flames.  His arms held high, his right hand grips a
     sword, a bolt of lightning, arrows, wheat, thistles, etc.  His
     left hand, holds a plain globe around which a serpent has
     wrapped itself.  He looks down at several pitiful mortals in a
     pit of fire.  The mortals reach for him, yearn for him, the skin
     on their bodies is stretched taut over their bones.

                                 MILLS (O.S.)
                   Atwater?  Paul Atwater.

                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)
                   No.

     Wrath shows a man surrounded by vaporous, satanic demons.  He
     stands in a puddle of blood, looking at his hands stained with
     and dripping blood.  Other than the rich red, the color is blue.

     Mills is at his desk, a good portion of the print-out list
     draped to the floor.  He rubs his eyes, sighing, gets back to
     it.  Somerset, at the temporary desk, studies his orphan list.

                                 MILLS
                   Okay, here we go.  Listen to the books
                   this guy's been taking out...
                           (reading list)
                   Basic Homicide Investigation.  Forensic
                   Toxicology... The Encyclopedia of Modern
                   Serial Killers...
                           (looks up, excited)
                   Of Human Bondage.

                                 SOMERSET
                   That's not what you think it is.

     Mills is disappointed, runs his finger further down the page.

                                 MILLS
                   Holy shit.  Somerset...
                           (reading list)
                   The Writings of Saint Thomas Aquinas.

     Mills points to the drawing of "the Sun in splendor with the
     eye" which hangs on the wall.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Aquinas.  Right?

                                 SOMERSET
                   That's right.  Let me have it.

     Mills looks at the page... searching...

                                 MILLS
                   Fuck... he used a false name.

                                 SOMERSET
                   How do you know?

                                 MILLS
                   His library card lists him as Jonathan
                   Doe.  John Doe.

     Mills sits back, angry.  Something strikes Somerset as odd.
     Familiar.  He starts leafing quickly through the orphanage list.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   What?

     Somerset finds what he's looking for.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Christ... it's like a sick joke.

                                 MILLS
                   What are you talking about?

                                 SOMERSET
                   There is one boy here.  He was
                   abandoned... no one knew who his
                   parents were, so he was named at the
                   orphanage...
                           (looks at Mills)
                   John Doe.  It's his legal name.


     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- EARLY EVENING

     Somerset and Mills climb stairs, turn a corner into this hall.

                                 MILLS
                   It's impossible odds that this is him.

                                 SOMERSET
                   We're focusing.

                                 MILLS
                   I know, I know.  On one little thing.
                   I'm not complaining.  I'll follow
                   anything we get and I'll take it any way
                   we can get it.

                                 SOMERSET
                   We'll look at him.  Ask a few questions.
                   Try to get a feeling whether we should
                   keep tabs on him.

     They reach a door, apartment 3A.  Somerset knocks.  Mills takes
     out his gun and looks at Somerset to ask "what do you think?"
     Somerset nods that he should have the gun ready.  Mills steps to
     the side of the door, knocks hard.  Waits.

                                 MILLS
                           (quietly)
                   I'll do the talking, right?  Let me
                   practice here... um, excuse me Mr. Doe,
                   but, are you by any chance a serial
                   killer?  Oh... oh, you are?  Well, come
                   with us then, if you don't mind.

     Mills smiles at his own wit.  A STAIR is HEARD CREAKING
     offscreen.  Mills turns to look towards the stairs.

     A MALE FIGURE stands at the top of the stairs, wearing a hat,
     standing in shadows.  The man looks at them, lets out a scream
     of horror and reaches into his coat.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Somerset!

     GUNFIRE SOUNDS and a bullet slams into door 3A behind Mills.  He
     and Somerset recoil in shock, going to the floor as another
     bullet explodes, blasting plaster off the wall.  The man is
     HEARD RUNNING back down the stairs.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   It's him!  Jesus Christ, we can get this
                   fucker!

     Mills jumps up.  He moves towards the railing.  Somerset sits up
     and takes out his own gun.  The stairwell is silent.

     Mills peers over the railing into the stairwell's center, gun
     pointed.  A HEAVY METALLIC CLICK is HEARD.  Echoes.  Mills leaps
     backwards as bullets begin raining up from below, accompanied by
     the SOUND of an UZI SUB-MACHINE GUN FIRING.

     Somerset lays flat as he and Mills crawl away from the railing,
     which is being shredded along with the floor around it.  Bullets
     soar unceasingly.  Mills and Somerset hold their hands over
     their ears.  Pieces of wood and plaster fly everywhere.  The uzi
     stops and the man can be HEARD RUNNING again.

     Mills gets up, covered in debris.  He runs down into the smoky
     stairwell.  Somerset rolls over, gets up more slowly.

     EXT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING, REAR -- EARLY EVENING

     Mills rushes out into this weedy, overgrown courtyard.  He sees
     a thin vagrant sleeping on the building's junk-pile, then looks
     all directions.  His eyes are wild.  His gun hand is shaking.

     The courtyard is surrounded by alleyways.  The shooter could
     have gone anywhere and is nowhere in sight.  Somerset comes out,
     face wet with sweat.  Mills holsters his gun.

                                 MILLS
                   Are you alright?  Are you okay?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Yeah.  I think so.

     They look at each other for a long time.  Both realizing they
     came very close to dying.

     EXT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING, FRONT -- NIGHT

     Police cars on scene.  Curious civilians have gathered.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

     UP THE STAIRWELL, several forensics are collecting shell
     casings, putting them in bags.  The casings are scattered all
     the way up the stairs.  ONE FORENSIC walks up beside a COP.

                                 ONE FORENSIC
                   I hear he's running around with an uzi
                   in one hand and a book of poetry in the
                   other.

                                 COP
                   A real, modern-day renaissance man, huh?

     AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS, two forensics, SARAH and BILLY, wait
     behind Mills and Somerset.  Surgical gloves on all hands.  Mills
     kicks at the door to apartment 3A with all his might.  Again.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOMONE -- NIGHT

     BOOM -- door flies open.  Mills enters with Somerset.  Darkness.

                                 MILLS
                           (to forensics)
                   Give us first crack at it.

     Sarah and Billy wait in the hall.  Somerset hits a switch on the
     wall and a lamp illuminates on a desk.  The desk is in the
     center of the room, facing them.  The walls, floor to ceiling,
     are covered with visual stimuli; pictures, paintings, newspaper
     articles, sketches, writings on napkins and notebook sheets,
     etc.  Mostly religious images.

     The far wall is made of shelves full of books.  Mills goes to
     the desk while Somerset goes to the books.  Books: An Overview
     of Theology, Handbook of Firearms, A History of the World, Summa
     Theologica, U.S. Criminal Law Review, etc.

     Mills looks at the desktop.  The surface is marked by dried oil
     colors.  There are tubes of paint laying out, boxes of water
     colors and pastels.  Mills looks at one corner of the desk.  An
     orange candle has been allowed to burn down.  The wax trail goes
     all the way down the edge of the desk to a puddle on the floor.

     Somerset walks, studying one wall of pin-ups.  There are
     articles about the seven deadly sins, pages from art books,
     pencil drawings of Satan and Christ, and drawings of the seven
     paneled tableau paintings which inspired the murders.  Somerset
     lifts several sheets to note the paper scraps are spaced so
     tightly and completely that they cover the window.

     At the desk, Mills opens the top middle drawer.  It's empty
     except for The Holy Bible.  he opens another drawer, which is
     filled with at least forty empty aspirin bottles.

     Somerset looks at a door which is papered over by all the
     newspaper articles and photographs about the seven deadly sin
     murders.  He opens the door --

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM TWO -- NIGHT

     Somerset enters.  The ceiling light is on.  There are
     bookshelves on each wall, filled with thousands of notebooks.

     Somerset takes one notebook down.  It is a thick composition
     book with a marbled black and white cover.  Inside, the pages
     are covered in small handwritten sentences and drawings.

     Somerset takes down another notebook and opens it.  Same as the
     first; scribbled sentences and sketches.

     He walks to another wall, pulls another notebook.  Same deal.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Jesus Christ.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM ONE -- NIGHT

     Mills opens a final drawer to find a rosary and a revolver.

     He looks around, nervous and excited, being in the murderer's
     lair.  He goes to a closed door across the room, notices John
     Doe's bed in the corner.  Sees Doe has a cross nailed to the
     ceiling directly above the bed's pillow.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM -- NIGHT

     Mills enters the bathroom.  It has been converted into a
     darkroom, lit by red bulbs, with strips of film hanging from the
     ceiling.  WATER is HEARD DRIPPING.

     Mills opens the shower curtain.  Prints hang drying, clipped to
     wires over the tub.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, THE PAINTROOM -- NIGHT

     Somerset enters from the room of notebooks.  This is John Doe's
     art studio.  Windowless, with several easels holding paintings
     in various states of completion.  The walls are covered with
     photos and finished canvases, except for one wall which is blank
     white.  Somerset turns the lights off.

     There is a 16mm film projector on a table, facing the blank
     wall.  Somerset turns the projector on.  It clatters to life,
     running a piece of film.

     The film is spliced into a non-stop loop. Somerset watches the
     wall, light strobing across him.

     The projector shows an image of clouds drifting, with strange,
     superimposed angels in flowing robes floating jerkily.  It's
     like an old, Hollywood version of heaven.

     The image switches abruptly to fire and tormented souls laboring
     around a pit of molten goo.  Like Heaven, it's a scratched piece
     of film from Hollywood's early days.

     Somerset turns to examine one of the paintings on an easel.  The
     painting has been skillfully rendered, in small, controlled
     brush strokes.  It shows a modern city street, stylized, dark.
     The city is peopled by mutated humans and freakish beasts.
     Sinners in the streets, killing, raping, pillaging.  Buildings
     are burning, blood is being spilled.  It's dense with detail.

     Somerset walks to another painting which is covered by a drop
     cloth.  He removes the cloth, uncovers a huge canvas.  We do not
     see the painting, but when Somerset does his features turn grim.

                                 MILLS (O.S.)
                   Somerset!

     Mills enters, tormented, weary.  He stands in the projector's
     bright beam, holds an 8" by 10" print.

                                 MILLS (O.S.)
                   Somerset, we had him.  Goddamn it.

     He hands a press pass and the photo to Somerset.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   The pass is a fake... we had him.

     Somerset looks at the photo, a picture of Mills and Somerset on
     the stairwell of the slum apartment building; the picture John
     took when he posed as a reporter.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   We were that close to him.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I know.

     Somerset motions to the huge canvas.  Mills looks:

     The painting is frightening collage, thick with paint.  The
     photo of Mills and Somerset has been incorporated in bits and
     pieces.  Duplicate images: enlarged eyes, hands, faces.  The
     faces have been ripped, scratched, mutilated.  Grainy eyes with
     holes jabbed in them are mounted in paint beside chopped broken
     arms.  Mills' head is on Somerset's body, and vice versa.  It's
     like a sick, fragmented vision of a slaughter house floor.


     EXT.  CITY STREETS -- NIGHT

     A block of burnt-out row homes and warehouses.  Stray, wild dogs
     roam in a pack.  A car turns down this street.  It's John Doe's
     car, moving fast.  Its headlights go out and it cruises,
     avoiding garbage cans in the street.

     FOLLOW the dark car.  Ahead, a few blocks away, we can see the
     only lights in this neighborhood, the flashing reds, whites and
     blues of police activity.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S CAR -- NIGHT

     John Doe brings the car to a stop.  He watches the police at
     work around the abandoned church.  He gives no discernable
     reaction, puts the car in reverse.  He looks behind as he drives
     back the way he came.


     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

     The refrigerator door is open.  A male forensic uses tongs to
     remove Zero's severed hand from behind soda cans and mayonnaise.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM ONE -- NIGHT

     The forensic walks through with the hand in a clear plastic bag,
     past a FEMALE SKETCH ARTIST who puts the finishing touches on a
     fairly accurate drawing of the balding John Doe.

                                 SKETCH ARTIST
                   This is the guy?

     Mills stands over the artist.  Sarah, Billy and two deputy
     detectives are at work in the room, photographing, searching.

                                 MILLS
                   Make sure it gets around.

                                 SKETCH ARTIST
                   You got it.  Tomorrow morning, this
                   city's good citizens will be on the
                   lookout for Elmer Fudd.

                                 SARAH
                           (to Mills)
                   We can't find anything to hang onto.  No
                   pay-stubs, no appointment books or
                   calendars.  Not even a book of phone
                   numbers.  And, you're not going to
                   believe this...

                                 MILLS
                   Keep looking.

                                 SARA
                   It's just... we haven't found any
                   fingerprints yet.  Not one.

                                 MILLS
                   You know, you're right.  I don't believe
                   it.  Keep looking.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, ROOM TWO -- NIGHT

     Somerset reads one of Doe's notebooks.  Three cops are looking
     through other notebooks from the shelves.  Mills enters.

                                 SOMERSET
                   We need to put more men on this.

                                 MILLS
                   I'm working on it, alright.  What have
                   we got.

     Somerset bristles slightly at Mills' abrupt demeanor.

                                 SOMERSET
                   We've got about five thousand notebooks
                   in this room.  And, as near as I can
                   tell, each notebook contains two hundred
                   and fifty pages.

                                 MILLS
                   Then, he must write about the murders.

     Somerset looks at the notebook, reads.

                                 SOMERSET
                   "What sick, silly puppets we are, and
                   what a gross stage we dance on.  What
                   fun we have, dancing around, not a care
                   in the world.  Not knowing that we are
                   nothing.  We are not what God intended."
                           (turns pages)
                   "On the subway today, a man came up to
                   start a conversation.  He was making
                   small talk, this lonely man, talking
                   about the weather and other things.  I
                   tried to be accommodating, but my head
                   began to hurt from his banality.  I
                   almost didn't notice it had happened,
                   but I threw up all over him.  And I
                   couldn't stop myself from laughing."
                           (closes book)
                   No dates indicated.  They're placed on
                   the shelves in no discernible order.  He
                   describes a scab on his arm for five
                   pages, then writes about existential
                   philosophy on the next.

     Mills walks.  He looks into the adjoining paint room.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   It's just his mind poured out on paper.

     Mills leans in the doorway, looking at Doe's strange artworks.

                                 MILLS
                   You were right.  He is preaching.

     The PHONE RINGS in the other room.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM -- NIGHT

     All attention is focused on the phone on Doe's desk.  A tape
     recorder is rigged to the receiver.  Mills and Somerset enter.
     Mills walks over, pushes a button on the recorder, picks up.

                                 MILLS
                           (into phone)
                   Hello... hello?

                                 JOHN DOE (V.O.)
                           (from recorder)
                   I admire you, David.  Imagine my
                   surprise on finding you at my doorstep.
                   I admire you more and more every day.

                                 MILLS
                           (into phone)
                   Okay, John.  Let's...

                                 JOHN DOE (V.O.)
                           (from recorder)
                   No, no, no!  You listen and don't talk.
                   I suppose you found the painting and the
                   photos.  This is just as well.  Now we
                   all know we've all seen each other.
                           (pause)
                   I mean what I say.  I do admire you.

     Long pause.  Mills waits.

                                 JOHN DOE (V.O.,CONT)
                   Oh, there is one other thing.  Fourteen
                   hundred thirty.  West Eighty-sixth
                   street.  Apartment six-o-four.

     John Doe hangs up.


     INT.  APARTMENT 604, BATHROOM -- NIGHT

     Somerset looks around this femininely decorated bathroom.

     In the sink, objects covered in blood: a pair of scissors, a
     hypodermic needle, first-aid tape and gauze bandages, a bottle
     of anesthetic for use with the needle, a straight razor.

     Somerset moves from the sink, looks in the bathtub.  The tub and
     shower walls are splattered with blood.  The tub has a few
     inches of water in it.  The water is cloudy red and bits of
     gauze float in it.  Somerset jiggles the drain's knob.

     Some bubbles pop up from the clogged drain.

     INT.  APARTMENT 604 -- NIGHT

     Mills is in a dark mood.  He and Dr. O'Neill stand by a WOMAN
     who hangs by a noose from the ceiling.  The woman's head has
     been bandaged sloppily with white gauze and tape.  Her eyes have
     been left uncovered.  The gauze is stained red in small spots.

     The woman hangs low, so her feet are inches from the floor where
     piles of dried flowers and a cordless telephone lay.  There's a
     chair knocked over behind her.

     O'Neill's going through his black bag.  A violet, velvet curtain
     has been draped on the wall in the corner, behind a full length
     mirror.  The mirror reflects the corpse.  A seven-pointed star
     is smeared in lipstick on the mirror's surface, with the words I
     DID NOT KILL HER, SHE WAS GIVEN A CHOICE below.

     Somerset enters from the bathroom, looks at the murder display.

                                 MILLS
                   Pride.  Just like in the painting.

     Somerset nods.  He walks to a dresser.  The woman's purse sits
     open and Somerset extracts her driver's license.  He looks at
     the photo.  The woman in the picture is beautiful.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You can see what he did.

     O'Neill steps up to the woman.  He brandishes dull scissors.
     The captain enters with two uniform cops.  He looks around,
     grim, clenching his jaw.

                                 MILLS
                   Cut her up... dressed the wounds.  He
                   put the noose around her neck and stood
                   her on the chair.

                                 SOMERSET
                   She had the telephone.

                                 MILLS
                   Call for help, and you'll live.  But,
                   you'll be mutilated.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Or, kick out the chair, and spare
                   yourself a lifetime of hideousness.

     O'Neill's cutting the bandages on the woman's face.  He pulls
     them away in front.  Mills looks, disgusted by the sight.

     Somerset sits in a chair, runs his fingers through his hair.

                                 O'NEILL
                   He cut off her nose to spite her face.
                   And he did it very recently.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Alright, boys, you're running on empty.
                   Go home.  Just make sure you sleep with
                   the phone between your knees.


     INT.  BOOKSTORE -- NIGHT

     The bookstore is a labyrinth.  Tables and shelves, mountains and
     valleys of books.  Books, new and used, hard and soft, in
     disorganized groups.  CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS.  A few customers
     search for titles.

     Somerset walks, downcast, winds out of one aisle into another.
     he has his jacket over his shoulder, runs his fingers along the
     books as he goes.  He pulls one book, The Merchant of Venice,
     looks at it, replaces it.  He looks down the aisle and is
     surprised to see Tracy.

     Tracy stands solemn, scanning book spines.  Somerset approaches.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Tracy?

     Tracy brightens a bit upon recognizing him.

                                 TRACY
                   Somerset.  How are you?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'm alright.  I'm glad to see you found
                   this place.  I almost should have
                   expected to run into you here, knowing
                   that you teach English.

     Tracy looks up and around.

                                 TRACY
                   It's so huge.  It's amazing.

                                 SOMERSET
                   This is why I moved into this
                   neighborhood.

                                 TRACY
                   Don't you love the smell of all the old
                   books.  It smells like... like... I
                   guess just old books, but, I love it.

     Somerset notices Tracy noticing his gun.

                                 TRACY (CONT)
                   Forgive me.  No matter how often I see
                   guns, I can't get used to them.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Same here.

     Tracy laughs.  She looks at her watch.

                                 TRACY
                   If David's going to be back home soon, I
                   should get back.

     She starts down the aisle and Somerset walks with her.

                                 TRACY (CONT)
                   I hope you'll come to dinner another
                   night.  Before you leave.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You can stay and browse a little longer,
                   can't you?  I mean...

     Tracy considers this as they enter an open area.

                                  SOMERSET (CONT)
                   I... I hardly know anyone I can talk
                   about books with anymore.  I'd
                   appreciate the company.

     Tracy stops.  Somerset looks hopeful.  Tracy is very tempted.

     INT.  BOOKSTORE -- LATER NIGHT

     Shelves and empty aisles of books.  CLASSICAL MUSIC still PLAYS.

                                 SOMERSET (O.S.)
                   The irony is, that after a day of the
                   type of work he did, he'd come home and
                   read me these morbid crime stories.  Le
                   Fanu's Green Tea.  Murders in the Rue
                   Morgue.

     MOVE TO the aisle marked MYSTERY, where Somerset and Tracy are
     leaning against shelves.  They both hold books they've selected.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   My mother would give him hell... because
                   I was young, and he was keeping me up
                   till all hours, giving me nightmares.

                                 TRACY
                   Sounds like a father who wanted his son
                   to follow in his footsteps.

                                 SOMERSET
                   One birthday, he gave me a hardcover
                   book called The Century of the
                   Detective, by Jurgen Thorwald.  It
                   traced the history of detection as a
                   science and it sealed my fate.  Because
                   it was real, and that a drop of blood or
                   a piece of hair could solve a crime...
                   was incredible to me.

     A CLERK looks down the aisle, then walks on.

                                 CLERK (O.S.)
                   We're closing up, Somerset.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Okay, thanks.

                                 TRACY
                   David's going to wonder where I am.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'll give you a ride.

                                 TRACY
                   No.  Please, don't bother.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I have to insist.  If your husband found
                   out I let you ride the subway at this
                   hour he'd tear my head off.

     They make their way out of the aisle.  Somerset chuckles.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   I mean, literally.


     EXT.  CITY STREET -- NIGHT

     Somerset's car stops at the corner of Mills' street.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Somerset puts the car in park.  Tracy sits for a long time, then
     turns to face Somerset.

                                 TRACY
                   You've lived here for so long, Somerset.
                   You know this city.  I...

     Tracy can't quite figure how to put it.

                                 SOMERSET
                   It's a hard place, Tracy.

                                 TRACY
                   When David and I lived in Philadelphia,
                   we could afford to live on the
                   outskirts.  But now...
                           (pause)
                   I hate it here.  I feel scared, and I
                   feel sick and... I hate it.

     Tracy wants to laugh, like it's silly, but can't pull it off.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You have to put blinders on sometimes.
                   Most times.  But, keep in mind, Tracy,
                   like tonight, there are small pockets of
                   sanity.  Some bars and bookstores.
                   Museums.  Several last vestiges of
                   civilization.

     EXT.  CITY STREET -- NIGHT

     In Somerset's car, Tracy and Somerset continue talking.

     On the other side of the street, closer to the middle of the
     block, John Doe's car is parallel parked at the curb.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Behind the wheel, John Doe is slumped low, calmly watching
     Somerset and Tracy.  He can see them clearly from here.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Tracy looks out through the windshield, fighting tears.

                                 TRACY
                   I've visited so many of the schools,
                   looking for work, you know.  And, the
                   conditions are... horrible.  I can't
                   believe how bad it is.
                           (pause)
                   Children shouldn't have to grow up here.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You can always look into the private
                   schools.  You'll find something.

     Somerset gives her a handkerchief.  She wipes her tears.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   You're too hard on yourself, Tracy.

     She will not look at him, keeping herself under control.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   It's okay to hate this city.  It's
                   natural.  But, there is a bright side in
                   all this.  There is.  You want to hear
                   it?

     Tracy is able to muster a small smile.

                                 TRACY
                   Oh, God, yes.  Please.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I can't think of another place that
                   needs education more than this city.
                   And you're a teacher.  You can make a
                   difference in a few people's lives.
                   It's a very good thing.

     Tracy leans to give him a kiss on the cheek.

                                 TRACY
                   Goodnight, Somerset.

     They remain close, looking into each other's eyes.

                                 SOMERSET
                  Goodnight.

     Somerset reaches to touch Tracy's face.  They kiss.  They kiss a
     long time.  Tracy wraps her arms around Somerset's neck.
     Somerset runs his fingers through Tracy's hair.  They share
     their sorrow.  Tracy's tears run down her face.  Finally, they
     part, opening their eyes.

     They know this is wrong.  Somerset's hands are shaking.  He
     grips the wheel, feels helpless.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   I'm sorry, Tracy.  I'm sorry.

     Tracy's face is flushed.  She is confused.

                                 TRACY
                   I... I better go.

     Tracy gets out, neglects to close the door, not looking back.

     Somerset tries to come to his senses.  He doesn't understand
     either, and his heart is aching.  He adjusts the rearview mirror
     to watch Tracy go.

     INSERT -- THROUGH REARVIEW MIRROR -- SOMERSET'S P.O.V.

     Tracy walks down the block, straightening her hair.  She runs.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Somerset looks away from the mirror.  he holds his head in his
     hands for a moment.

     EXT.  CITY STREET -- NIGHT

     Somerset leans to pull the door shut, puts the car in gear.
     He drives, turns the corner.

     INT.  JOHN DOE'S CAR -- NIGHT

     John Doe watches Somerset's car leave.  Doe turns his attention
     to Tracy, who hurries along the other side of the street.  Tracy
     looks back, enters her apartment building, digs out her keys.
     She gets through the door and climbs stairs, disappearing.

     EXT.  CITY STREET -- NIGHT

     Doe gets out of his car.

     He looks both ways down the street, walks towards Mills' and
     Tracy's building.


     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- LATER NIGHT

     Mills and Tracy are asleep in their bed.  Mills' eyes shift
     under their lids.  Rapid eye movement.

     A SOUND is HEARD from the other room.  Mills awakens.  He lays
     still a moment, then gets up, slowly, reaches to take his gun
     off the bedside table.  He grabs his pants from a chair, slides
     into them.

     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- NIGHT

     Mills opens the bedroom door and enters quietly, gun held up.
     He moves, crouching.

     In the dark, objects in the room and shadows from windows form
     complex, confusing patterns.

     Mills walks between moving boxes, attempting to remain silent.
     He aims the gun from point to point as he advances.

     He gets to a closet.  Staying on one side, he opens the door and
     points his gun.  He carefully separates the clothing hanging
     there.  Nothing.  No one.

     He turns to look over the room.  It's the first time we see it
     in Mills' eyes -- real fear.

     The door to the apartment is wide open.

     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY -- NIGHT

     Mills moves from his apartment, gun out, into the dark hallway.
     The coast is clear.  He stays low, moves down the hall.  He
     stops, looks up.

     EXT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING, ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

     Mills shoves the rooftop door open.  It creaks as it swings.

     Mills moves out, backwards, looking to top the raised rooftop
     entrance, covering it with his gun.  He moves around, sees
     nothing, walks to the edge of the roof and looks over.

     INT.  MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Mills returns to the bedroom, still holding his gun up.  He
     looks at Tracy asleep in the bed.  The room begins to RATTLE a
     little as a subway train is again passing underground.

     He walks to the window and checks the lock.  He halts.  He opens
     the window and reaches out.  The rattling is a bit LOUDER.

     From the fire escape, he picks up a bundle of thorny thistles
     wrapped with a rubber band.  Mills realizes, Doe was here.


     INT.  SAFE HOUSE -- NIGHT

     The room is plain, like the room Mrs. Gold was kept in.  The
     door opens and Tracy and Mills enter.  They look sleepy,
     carrying suitcases.  A uniformed cop closes the door for them.

     Mills goes to lay a suitcase on a table while Tracy looks
     around, depressed, distant.  The lighting is bad.  There are no
     decorations, no windows.  A wide crack runs down one wall.

     Tracy sits down on the bed.  Mills notices her discontent.

                                 MILLS
                   It won't be for long, honey.  I swear.
                   This is just till this is over.

                                 TRACY
                   I know.

     Mills goes to sit beside her.  He puts his hand on her shoulder.

                                 MILLS
                   I'm sorry.

     Tracy nods.  She stands, goes to start turning down the covers.

                                 TRACY
                   I know.  It can't be helped.

     Mills feels useless, powerless.  He goes to the suitcase and
     starts unpacking the contents.  Tracy continues turning down the
     sheets.


     INSERT -- TITLE CARD

     SATURDAY

     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- EARLY MORNING

     The chalkboard:            1 gluttony (x)      5 lust
                                2 greed (x)         6 envy

                                4 pride (x)

     Somerset is seated, holding the photo of the lust painting from
     the tableau.  Mills is behind his own desk.  They both look like
     they haven't gotten much sleep.

                                 MILLS
                   There's two people in that painting.
                   So, maybe he's planning to kill two
                   people this time.  Maybe.

     Mills looks at Somerset, who doesn't seem to be listening.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   What's wrong this morning?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Nothing.  Sorry.

     Somerset looks up, sips from a cup of coffee, looks at the
     photo.  Mills swings his chair, looks out the window at the
     morning light on the billboard.

                                 MILLS
                   Lust is next.  Lust is sex.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Apples on the floor.  Original sin.

                                 MILLS
                   Adam and Eve.

     Somerset puts the photo down, leans back, takes out a cigarette.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Sex, sex, sex.  Fucking sex.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Lust is everywhere.  That's the hard
                   part.  I think lust is the most
                   prevalent sin, even more than greed.

     Somerset looks at the burning tip of his cigarette.  He gets up
     to stretch his legs.

     Mills picks up the lust photo, puts his feet up on the desk.

                                 MILLS
                   Lust is red.

     Long pause.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Bright red.

                                 MILLS
                   Blood red.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

                                 MILLS
                   Red blooded.  Red head.  Dead.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Red light district.

     Pause.  Realization.  Somerset and Mills look at each other.

                                 MILLS
                   That would make sense.

                                 SOMERSET
                   It would be fitting.

                                 MILLS
                   You're damn right it would.

     Mills picks up the phone.


     EXT.  CITY STREETS, PORNO DISTRICTS -- AFTERNOON

     Porno theaters and Adult Bookstores rule these busy sidewalks.
     Marquees offer SEXY STUFF, PUSSY FEST and movies like MIDNIGHT
     PLOWBOY and NATIONAL LAM-PORN'S CHRISTMAS INSERTION.  Cops are
     walking through the pedestrian flow, handing out photocopies.
     There are many patrol cars on the street.  Definitely a larger
     than usual police presence.

     Cops are questioning the proprietors of porn at the entrances of
     their shops and theaters.

     Cops are taping photocopies onto lamp posts.  These photocopies
     are warnings, with the drawing of John Doe's face above a line
     of information and the words HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?


     INT.  WILD BILL'S LEATHER SHOPPE -- AFTERNOON

     Somerset's holding up the composite sketch of John Doe.

                                 WILD BILL (O.S.)
                   Yeah, he was here.  This morning.

     Mills and Somerset are across the sales counter from WILD BILL,
     37.  Wild Bill is shirtless, covered in tattoos.  A thick scar
     runs down his forehead to his bent nose.  Leather belts, whips
     and jackets hang from the walls.

                                 MILLS
                   It was definitely him?  You're positive?

                                 WILD BILL
                   Yeah.  John Doe.  Easy name to remember.

                                 SOMERSET
                   What was this job you did for him?

     Wild Bill pulls a box from behind the counter, digs in it.

                                 WILD BILL
                   I got a picture of it.  That's what he
                   came for this morning.  I figured he
                   must be one of those art guys... like
                   those guys who piss in a cup and drink
                   it on stage.  Performance art.

     Wild Bill gives a polaroid to Mills.  We don't see the image.

                                 MILLS
                   Oh, fuck...

                                 WILD BILL
                   I think I undercharged him.  I was up
                   all night working to finish it.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (looks at photo)
                   You built this for him?  You built this?

                                 WILD BILL
                   I've built weirder shit than that.

     A BEEL CHIMES as a POLICEMAN enters the store.

                                 POLICEMAN
                   Somerset... we have a situation.

     Mills and Somerset follow the policeman out.

                                 WILD BILL
                   Hey, my picture!

     They're gone.  Wild Bill scratches his scar.

                                 WILD BILL (CONT)
                   Fucking pigs.


     EXT.  THE HOT HOUSE MASSAGE PARLOR -- AFTERNOON

     It's a madhouse outside The Hot House.  Police action in
     progress.  Cops have formed a barrier, holding off a crowd and
     creating an aisle to the back of a jail-van.  Cops and
     detectives escort various men, women and transvestites into the
     large vehicle.  The crowd, consisting of the dregs of society,
     is angry.  Some spit and throw trash at the cops.

     INT.  THE HOT HOUSE, RECEPTION AREA -- AFTERNOON

     An ANGRY COP pounds his nightstick on a glass cage.  Inside the
     cage sits an oily FAT MAN in front of a wall of sex toys.

                                 FAT MAN
                   Just wait!

                                 COP
                   Get out of the fucking booth!

                                 FAT MAN
                   Just wait!  I'll come out, just wait!

     INT.  THE HOT HOUSE, CORRIDORS -- AFTERNOON

     All the lights and walls are red.  Mills and Somerset follow a
     COP through the twisting corridors.  ROCK MUSIC THROBS.  They
     reach a door.

                                 COP
                   I don't want to go in there again.

     INT.  THE HOT HOUSE, RED ROOM -- AFTERNOON

     Mills and Somerset enter.  ROCK MUSIC CONTINUES, LOUD.  A strobe
     light flashes from the ceiling onto TWO AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS.
     The first attendant places a sheet over a bed, hiding the corpse
     of a WOMAN with long blonde hair.  The second attendant tries to
     examine the pupils of a CRAZED MAN, 55, who sits naked on the
     floor, wrapped in a sheet.  A COP holds the crazed man down.

                                 CRAZED MAN
                   He... he... he made me do it!

                                 SECOND ATTENDANT
                   I have to look at you.  I have to look
                   at you.

     An X is scratched into the red paint on the wall.  Mills and
     Somerset move towards the covered body.

     There are apples on the bed and floor.  The ROCK MUSIC from
     outside SUDDENLY STOPS.

                                 FIRST ATTENDANT
                   You're not going to want to see this
                   more than once.

                                 CRAZED MAN
                   He had a gun!  He... he made me do it!

     The sheet is lifted for the detectives.  They grimace at what
     they see.  We do not see.  Somerset closes his eyes and walks to
     face a wall, shaken.  The first attendant replaces the sheet.

     Mills steps back, takes out his handkerchief and sucks on it.

                                 CRAZED MAN (O.S.,CONT)
                   He made me do it!


     INT.  SANATORIUM, WHITE ROOM -- AFTERNOON

     A polaroid is on a white table.  It is the photo Wild Bill gave
     to Mills and Somerset.  It is a picture of a belt, made with
     extra leather straps so it can be worn securely around the
     groin.  It is a strap-on phallus, but there is no plastic
     protuberance.  Instead, there is a metal knife.  It is a strap-
     on butcher's knife.

     Somerset is seated beside the white table in this white room.
     Mills stands behind him.  The crazed man from the lust murder is
     in a chair across the room.  The crazed man is crying.

                                 CRAZED MAN
                   And... and... and he said... he asked if
                   I was married.  And, I could see he had
                   a gun in his hand.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Where was the girl?

                                 CRAZED MAN
                   What?  What?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Where was the prostitute?

                                 CRAZED MAN
                   She was... she was on the bed.  She was
                   just sitting on the bed.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Who tied her down?  You or him?

                                 CRAZED MAN
                   He had a gun.  He had a gun, and he made
                   it happen.  He made me do it!
                   He made me put it on... that thing.  Oh,
                   God... he made me wear it.  He had the
                   gun in my mouth.

     The man slides off the chair and hides his face in his hands.

                                 CRAZED MAN (CONT)
                   The gun was in my throat.

     Mills looks at the mirror in the room.

     Somerset stands, picks up the Polaroid as two men in white
     uniforms enter to collect the crazed man from off the floor.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING

     Somerset and Mills are shell-shocked, seated at their desks.
     Somerset is looking out the window.  Mills stares at the wall.

     Somerset looks to his temporary desk.  He picks up a small pile
     of mail, sorts through it.  An 8" by 10" manila envelope
     interests him.  It reads DETECTIVE SOMERSET on the outside,
     handwritten in red marker.  He opens it.

     He takes out a grainy photograph of he and Tracy kissing in his
     car.  It's obviously been taken with a special night-lens.

     Somerset goes pale, suppressing a gasp.  He holds the photo to
     hide it from Mills, looks to see Mills has not noticed.  He
     feels panicky, crumples the photo and envelope in his hand.

     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, MEN'S ROOM -- NIGHT

     Somerset enters, latches the door.  He takes the crushed photo
     and envelope from his pocket.  He quickly checks under the
     stalls to see he is alone.  He opens a window, goes to the sink.

     He takes out his cigarette lighter, lights the envelope and
     photo, watches them catch.  Once they're burning steady he
     throws them in the sink.

     He backs away, leans against the wall, watching, feeling sick.


     INT.  SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT

     Somerset and Mills sit with a full pitcher of beer between them.
     The JUKEBOX plays QUIETLY for other customers.  The walls of the
     bar are lined with trophies, ribbons and other victory symbols.

                                 SOMERSET
                   There's not going to be a happy ending.
                   It's not possible.

                                 MILLS
                   If we get him, I'll be happy enough.

                                 SOMERSET
                   No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's
                   good guys against the bad guys in this
                   city.

     Mills drinks deep, pours more.

                                 MILLS
                   How can you say that?  Especially after
                   today?

                                 SOMERSET
                   You tell me... when you walk into an
                   apartment, and a man has beaten his wife
                   to death, or, a wife murdered her
                   husband in cold blood... and you have to
                   wash the blood off their children.  You
                   put the killer in jail.  Who won?

                                 MILLS
                   If I thought like you, I'd have slit my
                   wrists a long time ago.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Where's the victory?

                                 MILLS
                   You do your job.  Follow the law and do
                   the best you can.  It's all there.

                                 SOMERSET
                   If we caught John Doe tomorrow, and it
                   turned out he was the devil... if it
                   turned out he was literally Satan, then,
                   that might live up to our expectations.
                   No human being could do these horrible
                   things, right?!  But, this is not the
                   devil.  It's only a man.

                                 MILLS
                   Why don't you shut the fuck up for a
                   while?!  Huh?  You make these
                   speeches... like you know everything
                   there is to know.

     Somerset sits back, looking at Mills.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   You think you're preparing me for the
                   hard times ahead?
                   You think you're toughening me up?
                   Well, you're not!
                           (pause)
                   You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying
                   to fight.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Who are you fighting for?  People don't
                   want a champion.  They just want to keep
                   playing the lottery and eating
                   hamburgers.

                                 MILLS
                   What the fuck is wrong with you, huh?
                   What burnt you out?

                                 SOMERSET
                   There's no one thing, if that's what you
                   mean.  I just... I can't live anymore
                   where stupidity is embraced and nurtured
                   as if it were a virtue.

                                 MILLS
                   You're so much better than everyone,
                   right?  No one's worthy of you.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Wrong!  I sympathize completely.
                   Because if you can't win... then, if you
                   don't ignore everything and everyone
                   around you, you go insane.  It's easier
                   to smoke crack, and not worry that your
                   wife and kids are starving to death.
                   And, it's so much easier to bear a child
                   till that child finally shuts up,
                   because it takes so much work to love.
                   And, if you bothered to think about the
                   abuse, and the damage, you'd be sad.

                                 MILLS
                   You're talking about people who are
                   mentally ill.  You're...

                                 SOMERSET
                           (cuts in, furious)
                   No, I am not!  I'm talking about common,
                   everyday life here.  Where Ignorance
                   isn't bliss, it's a matter of survival.

                                 MILLS
                   Listen to yourself.  You say, "the
                   problem with people is they don't care,
                   so I don't care about people."  But, if
                   you're not part of the solution...

                                 SOMERSET
                           (cuts him off)
                   People who are in arguments over their
                   heads always use meaningless slogans.
                   But, life doesn't conform to analogies.

                                 MILLS
                   You're already here, and you've been
                   here a long time.  So, there's a part of
                   you that knows, even if everything you
                   say is true, none of it matters.

                                 SOMERSET
                   That part of me is dead.

     Mills stands.

                                 MILLS
                   Fuck you.  You want me to agree with
                   you.  "Yeah, you're right, Somerset,
                   this place is fucked.  Let's go live in
                   a fucking log cabin!"  Well, I don't
                   agree with you.  You're quitting, and it
                   makes me sick.  Cause, you're the best
                   I've ever seen.

     Mills digs out some money and throws it on the table.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Thanks for the beer.

     Mills leaves.  Other patrons watch him go.  Somerset takes out a
     cigarette.  He goes to light it.  The lighter will not light,
     and when it does, Somerset's hand is shaking.


     INT.  SAFE HOUSE -- NIGHT

     Mills comes quietly into the bedroom.  Tracy is asleep in the
     bed.  Mills takes off his jacket, puts it down.  He sits on a
     chair and unties one shoe, takes it off.  He looks at Tracy,
     looks at her a long time.

     He puts the shoe on the floor and goes to get on the bed.  He
     kisses Tracy's forehead, looks at her sleeping innocently.  He
     is touched, saddened.  He kisses her cheek, then wraps his arms
     under and around her.  He holds tight, kisses her again.  Tracy
     stirs.

                                 TRACY
                   David?

     Mills his face against her, holding tighter still.

                                 MILLS
                   I love you.

     Tracy holds his face in her hands, sees that he is crying.

                                 TRACY
                   David?

                                 MILLS
                   I love you.

     Mills clings to her.  She wraps her arms around him as he cries
     quietly against her, and she kisses him, tries to comfort him.
     He sobs.


     EXT.  CITY STREETS, INDUSTRIAL AREA -- NIGHT

     John Doe walks in this section of huge industrial complexes.
     Factories and foundries are lined side by side, seemingly for
     miles.  We can HEAR TUGBOAT HORNS sounding low and deep.  We're
     near the water.

     Doe seems to know where he's going.  He passes stacks of
     industrial piping and steel drums piled to the sky.

     He walks through an industrial junk-yard filled with trashed
     bulldozers, trucks and discarded factory equipment.  It's like a
     stroll through a bone-yard of dead dinosaurs.

     At the end of this field of metal, there is a tall, narrow
     alleyway formed by two warehouses.  Doe enters, looking up at
     the single lit bulb on the wall above.

     He looks at the ground, picks up a rock and a beaten hubcap,
     walks under the bulb.  He throws the hubcap with all his might.
     It soars, but misses the bulb, falls to the ground behind.

     Doe takes aim with the rock.  He throws, grunting.

     The rock smashes the bulb, bringing darkness to the alley.

     Doe walks back to the mouth of the alley.  He stops and turns to
     start from there.  He walks, deliberately, looking down at his
     feet.    FOLLOW as he walks.

     He stops, looks back to the way he came, then looks down at the
     ground in front of him again.  He takes off his thick glasses.

     He holds the glasses in his hand.


     INT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

     Somerset is in bed.  The metronome is sounding: tick, tick,
     tick... The SOUNDS of the CITY are LOUD.

     Somerset closes his eyes, concentrating on the metronome.  Tick,
     tick, tick... A MAN and a WOMAN are HEARD SCREAMING at each
     other incoherently from outside.  Somerset rolls over, restless. 
     Tick, tick, tick...

     A THIRD VOICE is HEARD from outside.  This man is screaming at
     the other two people to shut up.  Somerset opens his eyes, sits
     up.  He reaches over, grabs the metronome and throws it against
     the wall.


     INSERT -- TITLE CARD

     SUNDAY

     INT.  SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- EARLY MORNING

     Somerset sits away from the bed.  He's smoking a cigarette.  The
     PHONE RINGS.  Somerset gets up, not in the best of moods.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (into phone)
                   Hello.

                                 TRACY (V.O.)
                           (from phone, upset)
                   Hello, Somerset.  It's Tracy.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Is everything alright?

                                 TRACY (V.O.)
                   Yes.  Everything's fine.  Could... could
                   you meet me somewhere.  To talk.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (pause)
                   I don't think that's a good idea.

                                 TRACY (V.O.)
                   I need to talk to someone, Somerset.
                   You're the only friend I have here.  I
                   don't know anyone else.


     INT.  COFFEE CAFE -- MORNING

     Somerset and Tracy are seated in a booth by the window.  The
     city's morning rush passes by outside.  The cafe is noisy.
     Tracy is very upset.  Somerset is very uneasy.

                                 SOMERSET
                   David doesn't know about this?  You
                   haven't told him?

     Tracy shakes her head.  Somerset sighs.  Long silence.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   I have to tell you, Tracy, I'm not the
                   one to talk to about this.

                                 TRACY
                   I just can't think straight.  I don't
                   know why I called you, except I can't
                   stand to hold it as a secret anymore.  I
                   had to get it out... and I can't tell
                   David yet.  Not yet.

     Somerset takes out his cigarettes, but thinks better of it and
     puts them away.  He watches Tracy stir her coffee.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I... I had a relationship once, very
                   much like a marriage.  And, there was a
                   baby.  A long time ago.  Things were
                   good.  And I got up one morning, and I
                   went on a case... a murder, like any
                   other.  Except it was my first since
                   hearing about the baby.  And, I felt
                   this fear and anxiety coming over me.  I
                   looked around and I thought, how can I
                   raise a child here?  So, that night, I
                   told her I didn't want us to have
                   children,  And, over the next few
                   weeks... I convinced her...

     Tears come to Somerset's eyes.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   I mean, I wore her down... slowly.

                                 TRACY
                   I want to have children.  But...

                                 SOMERSET
                   I can tell you, I know... I'm positive I
                   made the right decision.  I'm positive
                   it was the right thing to do.  But,
                   there's never a day that goes by that I
                   don't wish I had decided differently.

     Tracy reaches to hold Somerset's hand, but he withdraws it,
     wipes his tears away.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   If you... if you decide not to have the
                   baby... if that's what you decide, then
                   never tell Mills you were pregnant.
                   I mean that.  Never tell.
                           (pause)
                   Your marriage would just wither, and die
                   altogether.

     Tracy looks around the cafe, tears in her eyes.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   But, if you decide to have the baby,
                   then, at that very instant, when you're
                   absolutely sure... tell him.  Tell him
                   that exact second.  And, spoil that kid
                   every chance you get.

                                 TRACY
                   Somerset...

     Somerset stands.  He forces a smile.

                                 SOMERSET
                   That's all the wisdom I can share with
                   you, Tracy.  I barely know you.

                                 TRACY
                   Will I see you again, before you leave?

                                 SOMERSET
                   Probably not.  But, it's probably better
                   that way.

     Somerset steps away, leaves.  Tracy watches him go.


     EXT.  CITY STREET -- DAY

     Mills and Somerset walk towards the precinct house.  They wade
     through cars to cross the street.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I've decided... I want to stay on, till
                   this is over.  Till either it's done, or
                   we can see it will never end.

     Mills remains impassive.

                                 MILLS
                   Oh, you want to stay now?

                                 SOMERSET
                   One of two things is going to happen.
                   We're either going to get John Doe...
                   or, he will finish his series of seven,
                   and he'll never be found.

                                MILLS
                   You think if you stay you're doing me
                   some big favor?

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'm requesting you keep me on as your
                   partner a few more days.  You'd be doing
                   me the favor.

                                 MILLS
                   You knew I'd say yes.

                                 SOMERSET
                   No.  I wasn't sure at all.

     They enter the precinct house.  Down the sidewalk, from a
     distance, comes John Doe.  His brown workboots and clothing are
     splattered with blood.

     He walks towards the precinct house, hands in his pockets, like
     he's merely out for a walk on a Sunday afternoon.  People on the
     sidewalk stop upon seeing him, avoiding him.

     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, RECEIVING LOBBY/BOOKING -- DAY

     Mills and Somerset walk past booking cubicles and benches of
     handcuffed low-lifes.  The place is swimming with activity.

     The two detectives head to a duty desk at the end of the room.

                                 SOMERSET
                   As soon as this is over, I'll be gone.

                                 MILLS
                   What a great big surprise that is.

     They pass through a gate and Somerset goes to the staircase
     leading to the second floor.  Mills stops at the duty desk.
     Other cops are fighting for the DUTY SERGEANT'S attention.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Mills and Somerset are on the premises.

                                 SERGEANT
                   Wonder-fucking-ful.

     Mills stops, looks.  Somerset stops, looks back down the stairs.

     John Doe stands inside the precinct house doors.  He holds out
     his arms as if to say "presto, here I am."

     Near silence comes to the room as all eyes go to the figure of
     John Doe.

     Mills is riveted, finding this impossible to comprehend.

     One UNIFORMED COP takes out his gun, points it at John Doe.

                                 UNIFORMED COP
                   It's him!

     Several other cops drop what they're doing and draw weapons.
     Mills, still off-balance, walks back through the gate, takes his
     gun out and points it at Doe.

                                 MILLS
                   Get down on the floor.

     Somerset comes back down the stairs.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Be careful!

     Cops move slowly in on Doe from all sides.

                                 ANOTHER COP
                   You heard him!  Get on the floor!

     John Doe gets on his knees, hands up.  Mills moves close, but
     not too.  ONE COP comes from behind, nudges Doe with his foot.

                                 ONE COP
                   Spread your legs and get your hands out
                   in front of you.

                                 MILLS
                   Get down!  Face down!

     John Doe gets on his stomach, obeys.  Mills comes right up to
     Doe, steps on his neck, puts his gun against Doe's head.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Don't move.  Don't move a fucking inch.

     Cops frisk and handcuff Doe.  Somerset comes beside Mills.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I don't believe it.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   Hello, Lieutenant Somerset.

                                 COP
                   What the hell is this?

     The cop putting the handcuffs on Doe holds up Doe's hands.  Doe
     winces.  Every single one of Doe's fingers has a bandage wrapped
     around it.  John Doe looks up, his face pressed against the
     floor, glasses askew, Mills' gun at his temple.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   I want to speak with my lawyer.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, OBSERVATION ROOM -- DAY

     Mills, Somerset and the captain stand in darkness.

     On the other side of a two-way mirror, John Doe is seated in a
     restraining chair in an interrogation room.  His hands and legs
     are bound with leather straps to the chair's arm and legs.  A
     strap hold tight around Doe's throat.  This is not some
     superman/serial killer.  He looks more like an eccentric college
     professor.  His lawyer MARK SWARR, 43, sits at a table, taking
     notes.

     Mills holds a fingerprint card.  The black ink prints are just
     useless blobs with traces of blood in them.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   He cuts off the skin of his fingertips.
                   That's why we can't find a single usable
                   print in his apartment.  For a long
                   time, he's been cutting before the
                   papillary lines can grow back.

                                 MILLS
                   What about the trace on his bank
                   account?  The guns?

                                 CAPTAIN
                   The orphanage is all we have.  His bank
                   account is only five years old and it
                   started as cash.  There's no credit
                   history, no employment history.  We even
                   tried to trace his furniture.  All we
                   know for sure is he's wealthy, well
                   educated and totally insane.  We may
                   never know how he got that way.

     Somerset stands looking in at Doe.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Because he is John Doe, by choice.

                                 MILLS
                   When do we get to question him?

                                 CAPTAIN
                   You don't.  This goes to court now.

                                 MILLS
                   This doesn't make sense, captain.  He
                   wouldn't just turn himself in!

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed
                   to make sense.

                                 MILLS
                   He's not finished!

                                 CAPTAIN
                   You're wound way too tight on this,
                   Mills.

                                 MILLS
                   Somerset... help me out here.

     Somerset looks at them.  Says nothing.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   It's over.

     The captain leaves.  Mills is furious.

                                 MILLS
                   Damn it, Somerset.  You know Johnny's
                   fucking with us.  He's pissing in our
                   faces again!

                                 SOMERSET
                   Slow up.  You and I are, probably for
                   the first time ever, in total agreement.
                   He wouldn't just stop.

                                 MILLS
                   Well... what the fuck, man?

                                 SOMERSET
                   John Doe's only two murders away from
                   finishing his masterpiece, right?  But,
                   can you even conceive of what might
                   happen next?  I mean, can you tell me
                   how he's going to go about it?

                                 MILLS
                           (pause)
                   No.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I can tell you this; I recognize his
                   lawyer.  His name is Mark Swarr.  He's
                   the one who kept Zero out of prison.
                           (pause)
                   We'll wait for John Doe's plea.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- DAY

     Mills is at the desk with his feet up, stares at the chalkboard:

                    1 gluttony (x)       5 lust (x)
                    2 greed (x)          6 wrath
                    3 sloth (x)          7 envy
                    4 pride (x)

     Clock on the wall says 4:45.  Somerset packs books into boxes,
     preparing for his eventual departure.  The captain opens the
     door and steps into the office.  He clears his throat, looking
     like there is something very wrong.

     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE -- DAY

     Mills and Somerset stand together.  The captain is behind his
     desk with the D.A., Martin Talbot, seated in front of him.  Mark
     Swarr addresses them all, seems nervous, but in control.

                                 SWARR
                   My client says there are two more
                   bodies... two more dead, hidden away.
                   He will take Detective Mills to these
                   bodies, but only Detective Mills.  Only
                   at six o'clock, today.

     Swarr wipes his brow with a handkerchief.

                                 TALBOT
                   Oh, Christ.

                                 MILLS
                   Why me?

                                 SWARR
                   He says he admires you.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (to captain)
                   This is all part of his game plan.

                                 SWARR
                   Mr. Doe claims that if the detective
                   does not accept this offer, the bodies
                   will never be found.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Frankly, counselor, I'm inclined to let
                   them rot.

     Mills walks up into Swarr's face.

                                 MILLS
                   You like what you do for a living?

                                 CAPTAIN
                   Back off, Mills.

                                 SWARR
                   I'm required by law to serve my clients
                   to the best of my ability, and to serve
                   their interests.

     Mills eases off.  Talbot is agitated, tapping a finger on the
     gold tooth in his mouth.  He looks at Swarr.

                                 TALBOT
                   We don't make deals like this.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   We're going to have to pass.

                                 SWARR
                   My client... he also wishes that I
                   inform you, if you do not accept, he
                   will plead insanity, across the board.

                                 TALBOT
                   Let him try.  I'd like to see him try!

                                 SWARR
                   Come now, Martin.  Even he knows, with
                   the nature of these crimes, I could get
                   him off with such a plea.

     Talbot stands, wringing his hands.  Mills and Somerset are
     looking at each other, thinking it over.

                                 TALBOT
                   I'm not letting this conviction slide.
                   I can tell you that, right here and
                   right now!

                                 SWARR
                   He says, if you accept, under his
                   specific conditions, he will sign a full
                   confession and plead guilty... right
                   here, and right now.

     Talbot looks at Swarr with hatred.

                                 MILLS
                   I'll do it.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Hold on... just a minute.

     Somerset turns to Talbot.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   If he were to plead insanity... this
                   conversation is admissible.  The fact
                   that he's blackmailing us with his
                   plea...

                                 SWARR
                   And, my client reminds you, two more
                   people are dead.  The press would have a
                   field day if they found out the police
                   didn't seem too concerned about finding
                   them... giving them proper burial.

                                 MILLS
                   I'll do it.  I want to finish it.

     Somerset is thinking it through.  He looks at Mills.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (to captain)
                   Well... let's get the fucking lawyer out
                   of the room, and we can talk about how
                   this whole thing's going to go down.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, BATHROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Mills' hand reaches to the sink to pick up a razor.  He's
     shirtless, his chest covered in shaving cream.  He starts
     shaving in front of a mirror.  Somerset is behind him, smoking.

                                 SOMERSET
                   If John Doe's head splits open, and a
                   U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have
                   expected it.

                                 MILLS
                   I will.

                                 SOMERSET
                   No emotion.  Stay as cold as ice.

                                 MILLS
                   I will.

     Somerset flicks ash in the sink.  Mills finishes shaving.  He
     steps away from the sink and wipes his chest off with a towel.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                           (very serious)
                   Listen, Somerset... we've been through a
                   lot together.  And, I uh...

                                 SOMERSET
                   What is it?

                                 MILLS
                   I would like to make sweet love to you.

     Somerset walks away.  Mills laughs.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Please...

     As they leave.

                                 MILLS
                   Give me a kiss on the lips.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Give me a break.


     INT.  PRECINCT HOUSE, READY ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Mills has his shirt off.  A female technician, Josie, tapes a
     radio transmitter and microphone to his chest.

     Somerset sits nearby at one of the ready room desks.  He wears a
     bullet-proof vest, is just finishing a check of his gun.  He's
     putting the bullets back into it.

     Josie finishes prepping Mills.  Mills presses the adhesive,
     making sure it will hold.  He puts on a shirt and bullet-proof
     vest, fastens the velcro.

     Somerset stands, puts the gun in his hip holster.

     Mills picks up his own gun, checks it, holsters it.  He watches
     Somerset take out a roll of antacids.  Somerset pops a few.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Ready?

                                 MILLS
                   Extremely.

     They look at each other.  Mills holds out his hand.  They shake
     on it.


     INT.  CITY STREET, IN FRONT OF PRECINCT HOUSE -- LATE AFTERNOON

     The street is full of shadows as the sun is falling low.  On the
     steps of the precinct house, a throng of reporters shifts
     anxiously.  A line of policemen holds them back.  The precinct
     doors open.  Martin Talbot arrives, escorted by cops.  The
     press swarm lurches forward, flashbulbs explode.

     Talbot holds out his hands, quieting them, about to speak.

     EXT.  CITY STREET, AT BACK OF PRECINCT HOUSE -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Mills' car pulls out of the fenced parking lot.  John Doe is
     seated in the rear.

     The car speeds up on the street, turns onto an avenue, heading
     into a canyon formed by tall buildings.  At the corner, a car is
     parked.

     Somerset is at the wheel.  He pulls out, follows Mills' car.

     EXT.  SKYSCRAPER ROOFTOP -- LATE AFTERNOON

     California is dressed in full battle gear.  He looks through
     binoculars at the city below.  The wind blows hard.

     He turns and runs to a sleek helicopter on the roof's heli-pad,
     climbs in the side door.  The PILOT leans back from the cockpit
     to hand him a helmet.  California dons it, starts strapping
     himself in so he can lean out the open door.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   Is this wind going to hurt us?

     The pilot cranks the helicopter's whining engine and the blades
     start to spin, churning the air.

                                 PILOT
                   Just makes the ride a little more fun.

     California hefts a high-powered automatic rifle as the chopper
     lifts from the pad and takes off.

     INT.  MILLS' CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Mills drives, looking to the back seat through the rearview
     mirror.  A steel mesh partition separates front from back.

     John Doe sits with his hands cuffed.  He is dressed in gray
     pants and a gray shirt.  His feet are cuffed to a metal fastener
     on the floor of the car.  Rivulets of sweat pour down his face.
     He seems wired.

                                 MILLS
                   What's your story, Johnny?  Who are you,
                   really?

     Doe pushes his glasses back up the bridge of his nose, looks at
     Mills' eyes in the rearview mirror.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   It doesn't matter who I am.  Who I am
                   means absolutely nothing.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Somerset adjusts the volume on a radio receiver mounted on the
     dash.  He watches the road ahead, tailing Mills.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   What's your deal?  You seem pretty
                   fucking nervous.

                                 JOHN DOE (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   I want this to go well.  It's very
                   important to me, obviously.

     INT.  POLICE HELICOPTER -- LATE AFTERNOON

     The chopper hovers amongst skyscrapers.  California and the
     pilot are listening, through their helmet headsets.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from headset)
                   You want this to go well?  What is this?

                                 JOHN DOE (V.O.)
                           (from headset)
                   Turn right on this street.  Stay in the
                   left lane.

     California leans out the chopper door, using his binoculars.

     EXT.  CITY STREET -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Mills' car weaves through traffic.

     Somerset's car isn't far behind, goes through a red light,
     barely missing a truck.  Other cars blow their horns.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON

     A cellular phone on the passenger side is BEEPING.  Somerset
     pushes a button on the phone's panel.  He puts on a
     headset/telephone, speaks into the mouthpiece.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I'm here.

                                 CALIFORNIA (V.O.)
                           (from headset)
                   Downtown and moving west.  Looks like
                   you're going to be crossing water.

                                 SOMERSET
                   If we're on the bridge, you keep your
                   distance.  You hear me?

     INT.  POLICE HELICOPTER -- LATE AFTERNOON

     The helicopter hovers steady.  California stows his binoculars.

                                 SOMERSET (V.O.)
                           (from headset)
                   Cross the river before us if necessary.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   You got it.

     California taps the pilot's helmet.

     EXT.  CITY SKY -- LATE AFTERNOON

     The helicopter dips, flying like a bullet over the city skyline,
     heading towards the river and the setting sun.

     EXT.  CITY STREETS -- LATE AFTERNOON

     FROM HIGH ABOVE, we see traffic on the highway at the polluted
     river's edge.  Cards and trucks move like blood through veins.

     DOWN CLOSER, we can see Mills' car in the flow.  The car turns
     into a lane of traffic on its way to the huge suspension bridge.

     Somerset's car is in close pursuit.

     UNDER THE BRIDGE, the police helicopter travels close to the
     water, moving parallel to the bridge, but low, so that it's out
     of the sightline of the vehicles above.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Traffic is bumper to bumper.  Somerset moves his headset
     mouthpiece to smoke a cigarette.  He steers onto the bridge,
     under the massive girders.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   For us to go pick up two more dead
                   bodies, and have that be the end of
                   it... just seems too boring for you.

     INT.  MILLS' CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON

     Beyond the crest of the bridge, the sunset is crimson.

                                 MILLS
                   Wouldn't be sensational enough.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   Wanting people to pay attention, you
                   can't just tap them on the shoulder.

     John Doe strains to turn, looks out the back window.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   Sometimes you have to hit them in the
                   head with a sledgehammer... and then you
                   get their strict attention.

                                 MILLS
                   What are you looking at, Johnny?

                                 JOHN DOE
                   Looking back... at the city proper...

     Doe situates forward, holds his hands in front of his face,
     looking at his bandaged fingers.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   And yet, no pillar of salt.
                           (smiles to himself)
                   Lost on you, isn't it?  You've never
                   read the Bible, have you, David?

                                 MILLS
                   I remember a lot of people reading it at
                   me when I was a kid.  I preferred the
                   classic comic version myself.

     This is an affront to Doe, angers him.  Mills sees it, likes it.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   I used to have "Godspell" on an eight-
                   track tape.  Does that count?

     Doe leans forwards, fury building in him.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   You make me sick.

                                 MILLS
                   Sit back, freak.

     Mills slams his fist against the partition.  Doe sits back.

                                 JOHN DOE
                           (under his breath)
                   Ignorant heathen.

                                 MILLS
                   Right, right.  I forgot.  You think
                   these murders were for God.  Right?
                           (pause)
                   I'm asking you seriously.  You really
                   think what you did was God's good work?

     Doe looks out the window at other cars, refuses to answer.

     He's pressing the tips of his forefingers into his thumbs,
     causing blood to drip from under the bandages.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   The Lord works in mysterious ways.


     EXT.  CITY STREETS, INDUSTRIAL AREA -- NIGHT

     It's getting dark.  We've been in this section of factories
     before, with John Doe.  The police helicopter soars overhead.

     INT.  POLICE HELICOPTER -- NIGHT

     California's looking down, wearing night-vision goggles.

     INSERT -- CALIFORNIA'S P.O.V. -- THROUGH GOGGLES

     The goggles allow California to see clearly into the maze formed
     by buildings, yards and worksheds below.  No one in sight.

                                 CALIFORNIA (O.S.)
                   Fuck, man... there's about a thousand
                   places to be ambushed out here.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     The headlights are off.  Mills' car's red brake lights are far
     ahead on this industrial road.

                                 CALIFORNIA (V.O.)
                           (from headset)
                   I don't see anything... not yet.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (in mouthpiece)
                   A quick sweep is all we get.  Clear out
                   now.  You're right in front of us.

     Somerset reaches to turn up the volume on his radio receiver.
     Mills is HEARD SINGING "Jesus Christ Superstar," loud.  Somerset
     allows a very faint smile.

     INT.  MILLS' CAR -- NIGHT

     Mills drives along, singing.

                                 MILLS
                   Jesus Christ, Superstar... who in the
                   world do you think you are?  Jesus
                   Christ, Superstar...

     Doe's in the back seat, trying to bear it, steaming.

     EXT.  INDUSTRIAL SKIES -- NIGHT

     The chopper goes high, away, over the industrial area.

     It moves to the other side of the factories and settles in low
     over the river.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Mills' tune comes to a conclusion.  Somerset slows the car as he
     sees Mills' brake lights go on ahead.

                                 JOHN DOE (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   We can walk from here.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (in mouthpiece)
                   You stay out of this unless I call you
                   in, California.  Understand?

                                 CALIFORNIA (V.O.)
                           (from headset)
                   You're in charge.

     Somerset takes off the headset/phone, stops the car.

     EXT.  INDUSTRIAL ROAD, AT SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Somerset gets out.  He looks through binoculars.

     INSERT -- SOMERSET'S P.O.V. -- THROUGH BINOCULARS

     Mills' car has stopped under the lights of a junk-yard.  Mills
     gets out.  He walks to unlock the passenger door.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   Alright, Somerset.  Going for a stroll.

     AT MILLS' CAR

     Mills opens the passenger door.  Doe looks out.

                                 MILLS
                   Lean on your side.  Hands behind your
                   head and lock your fingers together.

     Doe obliges.  Mills moves to unchain Doe's feet, cautious.

     INSERT -- SOMERSET'S P.O.V. -- THROUGH BINOCULARS

     Mills lets Doe out.  Doe does a deep knee bend to loosen his
     legs.  Mills takes out his gun.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   Where are we going?

     Doe points with handcuffed hands, at a path through the junk-
     yard, towards warehouses.  Mills motions with his gun.

                                 MILLS (V.O.,CONT)
                           (from receiver)
                   Lead the way.

     Doe starts walking.  Mills follows, keeping the gun on Doe.  We
     lose sight of them behind the junk-yard's massive pieces.

     AT SOMERSET'S CAR

     Somerset lowers his binoculars.  He gets back in the car, leaves
     the lights off, drives slowly towards Mills' car.

     EXT.  INDUSTRIAL AREA, JUNK-YARD -- NIGHT

     Mills follows Doe past rusting collections of machines.  We took
     this walk with Doe before, through this metallic bone-yard.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   It's right this way.

     Mills is on edge.  His eyes search the towering, twisted junk.
     Sharp edges reach for the sky.  Glass breaks under their feet.

                                 MILLS
                   So far, so good.

     SOUNDS of BOATS on the river can be HEARD.  Doe's heading for
     the alleyway created by two warehouses beyond the junk-yard.

     Doe nears the alleyway.  It is pitch dark.  Doe stops before
     entering, turns to Mills.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   In here.

     Mills steps up, keeping his distance from Doe.  He can't see a
     thing in the blackness ahead.

                                 MILLS
                   You go first.

     Doe faces the alley.  He starts walking.  We MOVE with him as he
     goes.  He's counting silently to himself, moving his lips.

     Mills walks behind Doe, keeping a sharp eye out in all
     directions.  He's about ten feet behind Doe, keeping his gun
     trained on the back of Doe's skull.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   Tell me where we're going.

     Doe continues walking, counting his steps, a bit quicker.

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Somerset has pulled along Mills' car, at the junk-yard.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   Slow down, Johnny.  Stop right there.
                           (pause)
                   I said stop!

     EXT.  WAREHOUSE ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT

     Doe walks on.  Mills is behind, walking to close the gap.  We
     can HEAR the faint SOUND of RUSHING WATER.

                                 MILLS
                   I'll blow your head off right now!

     Doe stops abruptly.  He spins on his heels, facing Mills.

     Mills is getting closer, pumped, ready to pull the trigger.

     Doe reaches up with his hands, takes off his glasses.  He holds
     them in one hand.  The SOUND of the WATER is LOUDER.

     Mills is about six feet from Doe, and knows something's wrong.

     John Doe smiles.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   What...

     Doe takes one step backwards and falls, straight down,
     disappears in the blink of an eye.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   No!

     INT.  SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Somerset looks towards the far off alleyway, horrified.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   Motherfucker!  No!

     INT.  WAREHOUSE ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT

     Mills stands facing the open manhole cover Doe disappeared into.

     A torrent of water rushes by underground.  Mills fires a few
     futile shots into the water, out of his mind with rage.  He
     pulls back the top of his bullet-proof vest, exposing the
     microphone.

                                 MILLS
                   He's gone, Somerset!  He's in the water!

     EXT.  INDUSTRIAL ROAD, SOMERSET'S CAR -- NIGHT

     Somerset leaps out, takes out his gun.  FOLLOW as he runs into
     the junk-yard as fast as he can.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from receiver)
                   I'm going in!

     INT.  POLICE HELICOPTER -- NIGHT

     The chopper's over the river.  California listens intently.

                                 MILLS (V.O.)
                           (from headset)
                   I have to go in after him!

     STATIC CRACKLES LOUD in his headset, then it GOES DEAD.
     California grips his mouthpiece.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   Somerset, what's going on down there?!

     INT.  UNDERGROUND WATERWAY -- NIGHT

     An underground pipe-way.  Mills tries to swim, is mostly carried
     in the flow.  He's battered against the sides of the pipe,
     holding his breath desperately.

     EXT.  INDUSTRIAL JUNK-YARD -- NIGHT

     FOLLOW Somerset as he charges onwards through the junk-yard,
     stumbling over pieces of metal.  He runs towards the alleyway.

     INT.  UNDERGROUND WATERWORKS -- NIGHT

     WATER ROARS.  A square pool of water churns.  A moment, then
     Mills rises, gasping, choking.  He's disoriented, furious,
     waving his gun, expecting Doe to be right on top of him.

     No one around.  Mills looks.  This is some sort of unmanned
     water switching station.  the walls are covered in catwalks,
     drainage pipes and tunnels.  Some tunnels and pipes spew water
     down into the central pool, others are sealed shut.

     Mills pulls himself from the central pool to a concrete
     spillway.  He stands up, searching.  Doe could be anywhere.

                                 MILLS
                   Come on, Johnny!  I'm right here!

     INT.  UNDERGROUND WATERWORKS TUNNEL -- NIGHT

     There is a plastic bag with an automatic pistol and extra clip
     inside hanging from a protruding shut-off valve.  John Doe's
     hands tear the bag open, taking the contents.

     EXT.  WAREHOUSE ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT

     Somerset enters the alley, short of breath.  He points his gun
     in front of him, fearful.  Moving slowly.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Mills!

     INT.  POLICE HELICOPTER -- NIGHT

     California is enraged, looks towards the pilot.

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   God damn it!  Let's do something!

                                 PILOT
                   Somerset said wait!

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   Fuck that!  Let's go!

                                 PILOT
                   Where?

                                 CALIFORNIA
                   I don't know!  Just go!

     INT.  UNDERGROUND WATERWORKS -- NIGHT

     Mills climbs onto a catwalk.  He passes tunnels, looking down
     each, intense, ready to kill.  A waterfall flows and over the
     other end of the catwalk.

     Mills stands, looking over the railing at the central pool and
     other tunnels.  He points his gun and fires into a far tunnel.

                                 MILLS
                   Come on!  Let's do it!  You and me!

     A figure appears in the center of the waterfall behind Mills.

                                 MILLS (CONT)
                   I'm not going to let you win this!

     John Doe steps out of the waterfall, putting on his glasses.

     He seems calm, unloads his gun into Mills' back... BLAM, BLAM...

     Mills twists, blown forward by the bullets slamming into his
     bullet-proof vest.  BLAM, BLAM, BLAM... he stumbles, trying to
     turn and fire back, but bullets strike him down and he falls to
     the floor of the catwalk, gun falling from his hand.

     CLICK.  Doe's gun is empty.  The gunshots echo.  Mills lays
     there on his stomach, pounded, blacking out, the hot bullets in
     his vest smoking and sizzling from the water splashing them.

     Doe moves quickly, starts searching Mills' pockets.

     EXT.  WAREHOUSE ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT

     Somerset comes upon the open manhole.  Water rushes by.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Christ.

     INT.  UNDERGROUND WATERWORKS -- NIGHT

     The central pool bubbles, undulating.  Somerset surfaces,
     inhaling, bringing his gun up.  He looks.  No one in sight.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Mills!  Pull out!

     His voice reverberates, barely heard against the roaring water.
     he swims to the edge, climbs out.  He walks, looking...

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                           (pleading)
                   Pull out now!

     Somerset looks up, and freezes up on seeing --

     -- Doe's handcuffs hang, swinging, on the rail of the catwalk
     above, with Mills' radio transmitter and wire tied to them.


     EXT.  INDUSTRIAL JUNK-YARD -- NIGHT

     Somerset runs to his car, driven, gasping for breath, still
     soaking wet.  He stops for one second, looks.

     Not too far away, the police helicopter flies low to the ground,
     turning in wide circles.

     Somerset climbs into the car, starts it up.  He drives away,
     leaving his lights off.  The engine protests loudly, forced to
     its limit.  The car disappears in darkness.

     The police helicopter circles, useless.


     EXT.  ABANDONED CHURCH/ORPHANAGE -- NIGHT

     The church stands elegant at night, when its decayed state is
     partially hidden.  Small shafts of light escape from holes in
     the facade and just into the blackness.

     Somerset is out of his car.  He strides towards the church,
     checks his gun as he goes.  FOLLOW with him, getting closer to
     the church.  He climbs the stairs.

     Somerset steps up and kicks the church doors open, met by a
     tremendous blast of light --

     INT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- NIGHT

     Flickering orange light from hundreds of once tall orange
     candles, now burnt low.  They greet Somerset, in the church's
     old candle racks, on the floor, on the altar and all through out
     the pews.

     Somerset's eyes try to adjust to the light.  He holds his gun
     ready, walks down the long center aisle.

                                 JOHN DOE (O.S.)
                   Hello, Somerset.

     Doe sounds far, his voice echoing from the front of the church.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Where's David?

                                 JOHN DOE (O.S.)
                   He's here.  With me.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Tell me what you want.

     Somerset can see through the heat warp.  Doe stands facing him
     from the altar.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   What do I want?  The same you... I want
                   an ending.  Stay where you are.  Put
                   your gun on the floor and slide it all
                   the way down here.

     Somerset obeys, bends, slides the gun down the aisle till it
     hits the bottom altar stair.  He keeps walking, slowly.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I want to see him.  Show me Mills.

     On the altar, Doe is sweating hard, standing over Mills.  Mills
     is slumped forward on the floor, unconscious.  His bullet-proof
     vest has been removed.

     Mills' hands are tied tight together in front of him, tied to
     one end of the thick rope suspended from the ceiling.  Doe holds
     the other end of the rope, has his gun tucked under his belt.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   You're an intelligent man, Somerset.
                   You understand what you're a part of,
                   don't you?  When this is finished, it
                   will seem surreal, but it will be a
                   whole, crystalline reality.  And, no one
                   will be able to deny it, no matter how
                   hard they try.

     Doe's voice is thick with passion.  Somerset is about halfway
     down the aisle, still moving.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You're a murderer.  That's all.  The
                   only way you've distinguished yourself
                   is by your particular brutality.

     Doe walks across the altar.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   You know that's not true.  You know.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You're killing innocent people, and I
                   should admire you?  You're doing it
                   because it gives you pleasure.  That's
                   the only purpose... your sick pleasure.

     Doe picks up a container of gasoline, looks out at Somerset.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   Stay where you are!

     Somerset stops.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   I won't deny my personal desires.  I
                   won't.

     Doe begins dousing Mills with gasoline, covering Mills' body and
     clothing.  Mills stirs, coming to.  He coughs, choking on the
     gas and fumes.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   But, I don't mourn the victims in this
                   any more than I mourn the thousands who
                   died in Sodom and Gomorrah.

     Somerset looks fearful.  He starts approaching again.

                                 SOMERSET
                   All you've done is cause more misery and
                   pain!  You've given people all the more
                   reason to believe there is no God!

     Somerset eyes his gun at the bottom of the stairs.

     Doe sees Somerset moving, throws the gas can away, takes out his
     gun.  Doe walks to the edge of the altar, all the time holding
     his end of the rope.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   Stop!

     Somerset is twitching with anger, looking at the gun about
     fifteen feet in front of him.

     Mills manages to look up, weak, his eyes barely able to open
     because of the stinging gasoline.

                                 MILLS
                   Somerset?

     Doe takes one step down off the altar.  Somerset is still edging
     forward, hands out away from his body.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Do you really think I'm just going to
                   let this happen?!  You think I'm going
                   to let him die?

                                 JOHN DOE
                   Yes.

     Doe fires his gun and the bullet slams into the front of
     Somerset's bullet-proof vest.  Somerset flies back, knocking
     over a rack of candles on his way to the floor.

     Doe walks quickly back onto the altar.

                                 MILLS
                   Motherfucker!

     Mills tries to grab at Doe as he passes, but Doe turns and kicks
     Mills in the ribs.  Mills cringes in pain.

     Somerset lays in the aisle, on his stomach, gasping.  He can't
     catch his breath, his twisted face pressed against the floor.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   How can you speak of God, Somerset?
                   When was the last time you spoke His
                   name?

     Mills tries to rub the gas out of his eyes with his bound hands.

     His mind works feverishly.  He looks around to see where he is,
     then he searches the floor.  We can see, inside his open shirt,
     the bleeding, upside-down cross Doe has cut into his chest.

     Doe walks back to shout angrily down at Somerset.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   When did you last speak His name?  Was
                   it in prayer?  Or, did you say the
                   Lord's name after you stubbed your big
                   toe?  Or, did you use His name to curse
                   another man?

     Somerset holds his chest, blinking, trying not to black out.

     Mills finds a piece of broken stained glass on the floor.  He
     picks it up, palms it, still choking on gasoline.

     Doe walks over to the statue of Saint Jerome Emiliani, pulling
     the rope from above so it goes taut and Mills' arms raise above
     his head.  Doe wraps the rope around Emiliani's arm.

                                 MILLS
                   I'm going to kill you, Johnny.  I'm
                   going to see you dead.

     Doe begins twisting the loose end of the rope around the statue.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   The irony, David, is that you policemen
                   and I want the same things.  But, you
                   are so short sighted.  In this city,
                   where you can see a deadly sin on every
                   street corner... and in every home, we
                   want repentance.

     Mills clutches the glass piece and starts cutting the rope just
     above his hands.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   We want good over evil.  We want values
                   instilled in the children.  We want a
                   world where a man or woman can lead a
                   decent life.
                           (pause)
                   Wisdom, understanding, counsel,
                   fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of
                   the Lord.  Such simple concepts.  Why
                   are they non-existent?

     Somerset manages to life his head, struggles to his knees.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (weakly)
                   Let him go, God damn you.

     Doe checks to make sure the rope around Saint Emiliani is secure,
     tightening the knots.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   There were two men once, who had
                   wonderful gardens.  Two gardens of
                   flowers that went on as far as the eye
                   could see.  Beautiful gardens... the
                   fragrance was inspiration in itself.

     Doe stands behind Emiliani, heaves against the statue.

     Mills watches, gritting his teeth, rubbing the glass against the
     rope, fingers bleeding.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   But, both gardens were beset by
                   problems.  Weeds started to take root,
                   and there were infestations of insects
                   and diseases.  The gardens started to
                   turn putrid.  And, one man fought to
                   save his garden, because he could never
                   forget how it once was.  Everyday he cut
                   the weeds, and killed the insects.
                   Fought the diseases.

     Doe finally topples the statue, down the altar stairs, and the
     other end of the rope pulls Mills upwards, screaming in pain.
     Mills is held, about eight feet in the air, legs dangling.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   That man never had a beautiful garden
                   again.

                                 MILLS
                   Fuck you!

                                 JOHN DOE
                   The other man plowed his garden under.
                           (pause)
                   He plowed it under the soil.  He started
                   over.

     Somerset gets to his feet, steadying himself on a pew.

     Doe walks across the altar, picks up a long metal pole with a
     thick wick and candle snuffer on the end.  He lights the wick
     from a near candle.  The flame burns long and thin.  He looks
     down at Somerset, takes out his gun.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   Stay there, Somerset.  Or, I'll kill him
                   right now.

     Doe holds the flaming pole up, near Mills.

     Somerset stops.  He looks up at Mills.

     Mills is straining.  He nods to Somerset, and Somerset sees
     Mills cutting at the rope.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Alright... you don't have to do this,
                   John.  You've already made your point.

                                 JOHN DOE
                   Do you think I chose this?  Can you even
                   begin to understand how painful my
                   existence has been?  It's like... like
                   having every sense heightened beyond
                   comprehension.

     Doe lowers the flame, standing below and beside Mills, with his
     attention focused on Somerset.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   So that the stench of the street coats
                   your throat like bile.  So, sugar is so
                   sweet it... it makes your bones ache to
                   the marrow.

                                 SOMERSET
                   You're insane.  That's why.

                                 JOHN DOE
                           (seething)
                   No!  You're wrong!

     Mills continues cutting, bleeding, almost through the rope.  He
     begins to swing his feet slightly, his body swaying.

                                 JOHN DOE (CONT)
                   I was chosen.  And I've wished a
                   thousand times I could have been a
                   normal man.  Like David Mills, a common
                   man... with a common life.  But, wishing
                   that is my sin.  I can't have it and I
                   shouldn't.

     Doe steps towards Mills.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Don't do this!

                                 JOHN DOE
                   I meant what I said.  I admire David
                   Mills.  I envy David Mills.
                           (pause)
                   Envy is my sin.

                                 SOMERSET
                   No!

     Just as Doe is to put the flame to Mills, the rope is finally
     cut through.  Mills drops, swinging his legs forward, smashing
     Doe in the face, knocking Doe's glasses off.

     Mills hits the floor with a thud.

     Somerset runs forward.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   David, get out!

     Doe has fallen back, dropping the metal pole.  Mills scrambles
     to his feet and charges at Doe, shouting.

     Doe squints, screaming, raises his gun.  Fires twice!

     The bullets catch Mills in mid-run, and carry him off his feet,
     backwards.

     Somerset grips his own gun, just as Mills' body falls, tumbles
     off the altar area and down the stairs in front of him.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   No!

     Somerset lets out a scream of pain and rage that chokes in his
     throat.  He falls to his knees and halts Mills' body.

     Somerset's shaking, unable to breathe, turning Mills over and
     cradling his head in his arms.  Tears come to his eyes.

                                SOMERSET (CONT)
                   David... David?  Please...

     On the altar, Doe throws his gun away.  he starts feeling around
     him, unsteady, looking for his glasses.

     Mills' eyes are closed.  He is still, bloody.  He swallows.

     With one gasp, without a word, he is dead.

     Somerset looks up at Doe, vision blurred by rage and tears.

     Doe stands, putting on his glasses, faces Somerset.

     Somerset lays Mills' body down.  Stands, walks up towards the
     altar, raises his gun.

                                 SOMERSET (CONT)
                   You.

     Doe stands, quaking, teeth clenched, fists balled up.  He waits
     for the bullets, falls to his knees.

     The gun trembles in Somerset's hand as Somerset brings the
     barrel to Doe's face.  A millisecond's pause.  Somerset changes
     the angle of fire.  BLAM, he blows John Doe's arm to pieces in a
     splattering explosion.

     Doe screams, falling back, on the altar floor.

     VIEWED FROM FAR BACK IN THE CHURCH

     The entire church with its candles frames the torture:

     Somerset walks to where Doe flops horribly, bleeding.  Somerset
     aims, shoots Doe in the leg.  Doe screams, rolling, trying to
     crawl away, knocking over candle racks.  Somerset follows.  He
     shoots Doe's other leg.  He shoots Doe in the other arm.  Flames
     begin to rise and spread quickly amongst the pews.  Doe
     continues to spasm, wrenching, hand slapping the bloody floor.
     BLAM, BLAM, BLAM.  Somerset steps back from Doe, overturns a
     rack of candles on top of him.  He steps away.  Watching.
     Flames begin rising on Doe's clothing.

     CLOSE ON JOHN DOE'S FACE

     Doe's face, covered in blood, twisted in agony, helpless, flames
     rising.  He continues screaming.

     His glasses crack from the heat.


     EXT.  ABANDONED CHURCH/ORPHANAGE -- NIGHT

     Smoke billows from the windows.  The fire is moving quickly,
     ravenous.  It's just starting to light up the night.

     From the front door, Somerset walks weeping, carrying Mills'
     body in his arms.

     INT.  ABANDONED CHURCH -- NIGHT

     The seven deadly sin tableau burns.

     Flames cause the paint to bubble and blacken.  Gluttony, greed
     and sloth are already halfway gone.

     Flames eat at pride, lust.

     Wrath and envy are being consumed.  Wrath goes last.  A man with
     bloodied hands, in tones of blue.  Flames devour it.


     EXT.  CEMETERY -- DAY

     A field of blue.  Cops in orderly rows.  The funeral of David
     Mills.  Many police officials and politicians stand in tribute.

     Somerset is here, in his dress blue uniform.  He stares forward,
     still numb, beaten.  Rifles are raised by a corps of riflemen.
     Blanks explode from the barrels.  They reload in unison.

     Somerset looks towards the grace where Mills' casket lies under
     an American flag.  Tracy is there.

     Tracy stands surrounded by strangers at the grave-site.  Her
     head is lowered.  She cries.  Each blast of the rifle salute
     causes her to react with a start.

     EXT.  CEMETERY -- LATER DAY

     The funeral is over.  Somerset stands at the edge of the
     graveyard, looking at the distant city.  Behind him, the
     mourners are still filing out to their cars.

     The captain approaches.  He comes to stand beside Somerset,
     similarly solemn.

                                 CAPTAIN
                   I don't know if I should do this.
                           (pause)
                   We found the motel room Doe must have
                   been staying in after you found his
                   apartment.

     Somerset hasn't acknowledged the captain, still looking away.

                                 CAPTAIN (CONT)
                   Anyway... we found this in his
                   belongings.

     The captain takes out a sealed envelope.  Somerset takes it.

     On the envelope: DETECTIVE SOMERSET, handwritten, in red marker.


     EXT.  MILLS' APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY

     Tracy and Somerset stand near a moving truck in front of the
     apartment building.  MOVERS carry Tracy's belongings to the
     truck.  Mills' car is attached to be towed behind.

                                 SOMERSET
                   I wish I could say something...
                           (pause)
                   Something to... I don't know...

                                 TRACY
                   I'll be okay.

     Somerset nods.

                                 SOMERSET
                   We'll keep in touch.  I'll come visit.

                                 TRACY
                   I'll write to you when we get there.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Take care of yourself.
                           (pause)
                   Take care of the baby.

     Tracy nods.  There's nothing left for them to say.  They're both
     empty.  It's time for them to give a gesture, a kiss, or a hug,
     to say goodbye, but neither makes the first move.

                                 MOVER
                   That's all, Mrs. Mills.  We got
                   everything.

     Movers latch up the back of the truck while the driver climbs
     in and fires up the engine.

                                 SOMERSET
                   Goodbye, Tracy.

                                 TRACY
                   Goodbye, Somerset.

     Somerset walks away.  Tracy walks away, gets in the passenger
     side of the moving truck.


     EXT.  CITY STREET -- LATER DAY

     Sidewalks jammed with people, hurrying.  Somerset walks in a
     fog, hands in his pockets.  He stops at a corner, but does not
     cross.  He stands there, looks up.

     At the city around him.  The buildings towering over him.

     At the cars, buses and taxies racing in the streets, blowing
     their horns and spouting soot.

     Somerset reaches into his jacket pocket, takes out the envelope
     from John Doe.  He studies it in his hand.

                                 SOMERSET
                           (to himself)
                   Oh... man...

     He opens it.  He takes out a small note, handwritten.  It reads:

                                          PLOW THEM UNDER.

     Somerset looks up again, mortified, fighting to keep control of
     his emotions.  He looks around:

     At the miserable people, walking past him.

     At a man at the top of the subway station stairs, sitting in a
     cardboard box, holding out a cup, rattling the change inside.

     A father passes by, holding his young son's hand.  Somerset
     turns to watch them as they pass.  The gather reaches to pick
     the boy up and carry him.  The boy holds tight.

     For some reason, this makes Somerset ache with sorrow.

     The father hugs his son to him, kisses him on the cheek.  The
     boy returns the kiss, with great affection.

     Somerset watches them disappear in the mass of humanity.  He
     looks back at the note in his hand.

     He tears the note up, into little pieces.


     INT.  MOVING TRUCK -- DAY

     The truck moves along in steady traffic.  Tracy sits beside the
     driver.  She looks out at the city across the river.

     She reaches into her pocket, takes out a small manila envelope.
     She opens the envelope and slides two keys on a keychain out
     into her palm.

     She's looking at the keys when she notices something about the
     envelope.  She reopens it, takes out a small folded piece of
     paper.  She unfolds it:

     It is the piece of wallpaper with the pale rose at its center.

     She smiles very faintly.


     EXT.  PRECINCT HOUSE -- EARLY EVENING

     Cars roll by in the street.  Cops come and go.

     Somerset walks up the stairs into the precinct house.

1 -BLACK

     The lonely sound of a buoy bell in the distance. Water
     slapping against a smooth, flat surface in rhythm. The
     creaking of wood.

     Off in the very far distance, one can make out the sound of
     sirens.

     SUDDENLY, a single match ignites and invades the darkness. It
     quivers for a moment. A dimly lit hand brings the rest of the
     pack to the match. A plume of yellow-white flame flares and
     illuminates the battered face of DEAN KEATON, age forty. His
     salty-gray hair is wet and matted. His face drips with water
     or sweat. A large cut runs the length of his face from the
     corner of his eye to his chin. It bleeds freely. An un-lit
     cigarette hangs in the corner of his mouth.

     In the half-light we can make out that he is on the deck of a
     large boat. A yacht, perhaps, or a small freighter. He sits
     with his back against the front bulkhead of the wheel house.
     His legs are twisted at odd, almost impossible angles. He
     looks down.

     A thin trail of liquid runs past his feet and off into the
     darkness. Keaton lights the cigarette on the burning pack of
     matches before throwing them into the liquid.

     The liquid IGNITES with a poof.

     The flame runs up the stream, gaining in speed and intensity.
     It begins to ripple and rumble as it runs down the deck
     towards the stern.                                                       

2     EXT. BOAT - NIGHT - STERN                                             2'

     A stack of oil drums rests on the stern. They are stacked on
     a palette with ropes at each corner that attach it to a huge
     crane on the dock. One of the barrels has been punctured at
     it's base. Gasoline trickles freely from the hole.

     The flame is racing now towards the barrels. Keaton smiles
     weakly to himself.

     The flame is within a few yards of the barrels when another
     stream of liquid splashes onto the gas. The flame fizzles out
     pitifully with a hiss.

     Two feet straddle the flame. A stream of urine flows onto the
     deck from between them.

                                            BLUE 06/01/94

                                                               2.

The sound of a fly zipping. Follow the feet as they move over
to where Keaton rests at the wheel house.

CRANE UP to the waist of the unknown man. He pulls a pack of
cigarettes out of one pocket and a strange antique lighter
from the other. It is gold, with a clasp that folds down over
the flint. The man flicks up the clasp with his thumb and
strikes it with his index finger. It is a fluid motion,

somewhat showy.
Keaton looks up at the man. A look of realization crosses his
face. It is followed by frustration, anger, and finally
resignation.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
           How are you, Keaton?

                             KEATON
           I'd have to say my spine was broken,
           Keyser.

He spits the name out like it was poison.

The man puts the lighter back in his pocket and reaches under
his jacket. He produces a stainless .38 revolver.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
           Ready?

                             KEATON
           What time is it?

The hand with the gun turns over, turning the gold watch on
its wrist upward.
The sound of sirens is closer now. Headed this way.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
           Twelve thirty.

Keaton grimaces bitterly and nods. He turns his head away and
takes another drag.
The hand with the gun waits long enough for Keaton to enjoy  
his last drag before pulling the trigger.

GUNSHOT

The sound of Keaton's body slumping onto the deck.

                                          YELLOW 06/11/94


                                                             3.

MOVE OUT ACROSS THE DECK. Below is the stream of gasoline
still flowing freely.

The sound of the gasoline igniting. The flame runs in front
of us towards the barrels, finally leaping up in a circle
around the drums, burning the wood of the pallet and licking
the spouting stream as it pours from the hole.

MOVE OUT ACROSS THE DOCK, away from the boat.

The pier to which the boat is moored is littered with DEAD
BODIES. Twenty or more men have been shot to pieces and lie
scattered everywhere in what can only be the aftermath of a
fierce fire-fight.

A BARGE COMES INTO VIEW.                                             

On the deck of the barge is a tangle of cables and girders.          
The mesh of steel and rubber leaves a dark and open cocoon           
beneath its base.                                                    

MOVE INTO THE DARKNESS.

Sirens are close now. Almost here. The sound of fire raging
out of control.

SIRENS BLARING. TIRES SQUEALING. CAR DOORS OPENING. FEET
POUNDING THE PAVEMENT.

MOVE FURTHER, SLOWER, INTO THE DARKNESS

Voices yelling. New light flickering in the surrounding
darkness.

SUDDENLY, AN EXPLOSION.

Then silence. TOTAL BLACKNESS.

We hear the voice of ROGER &quot;VERBAL&quot; KINT, whom we will soon
meet.

                         VERBAL (V.O.)
           New York. - six weeks ago. A truck loaded
           with stripped gun parts got jacked
           outside of Queens. The driver didn't see
           anybody, but somebody fucked up. He heard
           a voice. Sometimes, that's all you need.

      BOOM
3     INT. DARK APARTMENT - DAY - NEW YORK - SIX WEEKS PRIOR TO
      PRESENT DAY

      The black explodes with the opening of a door into a dark
      room. Outside, the hall is filled with blinding white light.
      Shadows in the shapes of men flood into the room. We can make
      out men in hoods with flashlights. They are laden with
      weapons.

                                   VOICES
                 POLICE. SEARCH WARRANT. DON'T MOVE.

      It is a blur of violent action and sound.'Beams of
      flashlights cut the darkness in all directions.

      FINALLY:

      A dozen flashlights land on one man. He lies naked in bed,
      Merging from a deep sleep. He squints at the flood of
      blinding white light, more annoyed than frightened. He nearly
      laughs at the sound of countless guns cocking. He is
      McMANUS. Age twenty-eight.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
                 Mr. McManus?

                                  McMANUS
                 Yeah.

                               VOICE (O.S.)
                 Police. We have a warrant for
                 your arrest.

                                   McMANUS
                 Will they be serving coffee downtown?

      Two dozen black gloved hands grab him and yank him out of
      bed.

4     INT. AUTO BODY SHOP - DAY                                            4 
      An old paint mixer vibrates furiously.
      TODD HOCKNEY, a dark, portly man in his thirties is working
      on an old Fire-bird.                                                    
      A YOUNG HISPANIC KID mixes paint a few feet away.
      SUDDENLY, the garage door opens TO REVEAL:
                                                   YELLOW 06/11/94

        A row of five men silhouetted by the bright sun.
        Hockney squints.


                                                YELLOW 06/11/94

                                  HOCKNEY
                 Can I help you?

      Hockney's voice is gruff.

                                    MAN
                 Todd Hockney'

      Hockney reaches for something just inside the door of the
      Fire-bird.  

                                  HOCKNEY
                 Who are you?

      All six men INSTANTLY PRODUCE GUNS and aim them at Hockney.

                                    MAN  
                 Police.

      Hockney withdraws a filthy towel and wipes grease and sweat
      from his forehead.                                                       

                                  HOCKNEY
                 We don't do gun repair.

S     EXT. STREET - NEW YORK - DAY

      FRED FENSTER, a tall, thin man in his thirties strolls
      casually down the street. He is dressed conspicuously in a
      loud suit and tie with shoes that have no hope of matching.
      He smokes a cigarette and chews gum at the same time.

      He happens to glance over his shoulder and notice a brown
      Ford sedan with four men in it cruising along the curb. He
      picks up his step a little. The Ford keeps up.

      He looks ahead at the corner. He tries to look as comfortable
      as he can, checking his watch as though remembering an
      appointment he is late for. The Ford stays right on him.

      SUDDENLY, he bolts. He gets no more than a few yards before
      cars pour out of every conceivable nook and cranny. Brakes
      are squealing, radios squawking, guns cocking. Fenster is
      surrounded instantly. He stops short and flaps his hands on
      his thighs in defeat.

6     INT. MONDINO'S RESTAURANT - DAY

      An attractive man and woman walk quickly through the front of
      a small New York cafe. They are charged with nervous, excited
      energy.

                                          YELLOW 06/11/94


                                                             5A.

The man is DEAN KEATON, a well dressed, sturdy looking man in
his forties with slightly graying hair. He looks much better
than he did in the opening scene. The woman with him is EDIE
FINNERAN, age thirty-three, poised and attractive - Easily
the calmer of the two.

                                                 BLUE 06/01/94

     They come to a staircase at the back of the restaurant
     leading down to a dark room. Edie takes Keaton's arm and
     stops him.

                                  EDIE
                Let me look at you.

     Keaton is uncomfortable in his suit, or perhaps the
     situation. Still, he smiles with genuine warmth.

     Edie straightens his tie and picks microscopic imperfections
     from his lapel.

                              EDIE (CONT'D)
                Now remember, this is another kind of
                business. They don't earn your respect.
                You owe it to them. Don't stare them down
                but don't look away either. Confidence.
                They are fools not to trust you. That's
                the attitude.

                                 KEATON
                I'm having a stroke.

                                   EDIE
                You've come far. You're a good man. I
                love you.

     Keaton blinks then stammers, looking for a response.
     PAUSE
                              EDIE (CONT'D)
                Live with it.

     She kisses him and runs down the steps with Keaton close
     behind. Keaton playfully grabs her ass and she nearly
     stumbles down the stairs.

7     INT. RESTAURANT - DOWNSTAIRS

     They come to the bottom of the steps giggling and jabbing
     each other. Once off the stairs they instantly transform as
     though hit with cold air. They assume a cool, professional
     exterior and walk two feet apart. One would look at them and
     see only two business associates here to ply their trade.

     They walk across the dimly lit dining room to a table in the
     far corner where two men are already waiting. The first is
     MR. FORTIER, age thirty-five, the other is MR. RENAULT, age  

     sixty. Both men are impeccably dressed with a distinguished
     air. They stand and smile.

                                  FORTIER
                 Edie, nice to see you.

                                   EDIE
                 Sorry we're late.

                                  FORTIER
                 Nonsense. Sit, please.

                                  RENAULT
                         (struggling with English)
                 You must be Mr. Keaton.

                                   EDIE
                 I'm sorry. Dean Keaton

     Renault's hand is already out.

                                  RENAULT
                 Monsieur Renault. A pleasure.

                                  KEATON
                 How do you do?

     They shake hands. Keaton takes Fortier's hand next.

                                  FORTIER
                 Monsieur Fortier. So nice to finally meet
                 you.

     Everyone sits at the table. All faces are smiling.
     LOW ANGLE: UNDER TABLE
     Edie's hand reaches out and finds Keaton's leg. Her hand runs
     high up his inner thigh and squeezes firmly.

     Her face is absolutely calm, giving no hint of what her hand
     is doing. Keaton smiles and clears his throat.

                                 FORTIER
                Edie brought us your proposal and I'll be                  


                honest. We're very impressed. A bit                       
                skeptical, I must admit, but impressed.                    


                                 KEATON
                Skeptical.
                                 RENAULT
                We find the concept brilliant, but New
                York is difficult for new restaurants.
                How can we be certain that our money will                  
                be returned in the long run?
     Keaton looks at Edie and smiles confidently.
                                 KEATON
                It's simple gentlemen, design

                versatility. A restaurant that can change                  
                with taste without losing the overall

                aesthetic. Our atmosphere won't be
                painted on the walls.

                                 FORTIER
                This was the part of the proposal that
                intrigued us, but I'm not sure I follow.                   


                                 KEATON
                Let's say for example -

                This I had to see myself.

     Keaton looks up. He sees David Kujan. Behind him are the very
     serious looking guys in suits.

     Keaton is not happy to see them.

                                 KEATON
                Dave. I'm in a meeting.

                                  KUJAN
                Time for another one.

                                   KEATON
                 This is my attorney, Edie Finneran.

                        KEATON (cont'd)
           This is Mr. Renault and Mr. Fortier.
           Everyone, this is David Kujan.

                             KUJAN
           Special Agent Kujan. U.S. Customs.
                 (Gestures to men behind him)
           These gentlemen are with the New York
           police department. You look great,
           Keaton. Better than I would have thought.

                            RENAULT
           Is there a problem, Mr. Keaton?

                             KUJAN
           The small matter of a stolen truck-load
           of guns that wound up on a boat to
           Ireland last night.

Renault and Fortier's confusion is giving way to suspicion.

                            FORTIER
           Mr. Keaton?

                             KEATON
           If you will excuse us for a moment,
           gentlemen.

                             KUJAN
           We need to ask you some questions
           downtown. You'll be quite awhile.

Renault starts to get up.

                            RENAULT
           We should leave you to discuss whatever
           this is.

                            KEATON
           Please. Sit.

Keaton stands up and throws a wad of money on the table to
cover the check. He looks at Edie. She moves to stand, but he
sits her back down with a hand on her shoulder.

                            KEATON
           Enjoy the meal.
                           (To Edie)
           I'LL call you.

Kujan takes him by the arm, but Keaton yanks away.

      He looks out over the dozens of other faces in the
      restaurant. Everyone is looking at him with some level of
      surprise. If Keaton is humiliated by the whole affair, he
      hides it well.

11    INT. LOCK-UP HALLWAY - NIGHT                                        11'

      A police officer steps into the frame and opens the steel
      door.

      FOLLOW A PAIR OF FEET as they shuffle across the cement
      floor. The shoes are shabby and worn, as are the wrinkled
      pants that hang too low and loose at the cuffs. The right
      foot is turned slightly inward and falls with a hard limp. It
      is clear that the knee does not extend fully.

      The sound of a steel door opening. The bottom corner of a
      steel cage comes into view. Another set of feet falls into
      step with the first. Another steel door and another set of
      feet. Another door, another and another. Five pairs of feet
      walk single file down the hall.

      The lame feet are in the front of the line. They come to
      another steel door, this one solid and covered with dents and
      rivets.

      CRANE UP TO REVEAL:

      ROGER KINT, VERBAL to his few friends. He has a deeply lined
      face, making his thirty-odd years a good guess at best. From
      his twisted left hand, we can see that he suffers from a
      slight but not debilitating palsy. Behind him are Dean
      Keaton, Fred Fenster, McManus and Todd Hockney.                      t

      Verbal steps through the door, followed by the rest.

                              VERBAL (V.O.)
                It didn't make sense that I be there. I
                mean these guys were hard-core hijackers,
                but there I was. At that point, I wasn't
                scared, f knew I hadn't done anything
                they could do me for. Besides, it was
                fun. I got to make like I was notorious.

      The five men are ushered into the room in front of a white
      wall painted with horizontal blue stripes. Each has a number
      at either end to denote the height of the man in front of it.
      Between these lines are thinner blue lines to tell the
      specific height in inches.

Bright lights shine on all of them. They squint, eyes
adjusting.

Keaton leans forward a bit and looks at the men in line with
him. He shares a look of familiarity with Fenster and then
McManus. Hockney smiles at all of them.

                            McMANUS
                          (To Keaton)
           Where you been, man?

                         VOICE (O.S.)
           SHUT UP IN THERE. Alright, you all know
           the drill. When your number is called,
           step forward and repeat the phrase you've
           been given. Understand?

The men all nod.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
           Number one. Step forward.

Hockney takes a step forward. He looks directly into a mirror
on the other side of the room. It is three feet square and we
can make out faint light behind it. It is a two-way. He
speaks in a complete dead-pan.

                            HOCKNEY
           Hand-me-the-keys, you-fucking-cock-
           sucker.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
           Number two. Step forward.

McManus steps up and makes a gun with his thumb and
forefinger. He mocks criminal intensity, pointing at the
mirror. He camps up his line.

                            McMANUS
           Give me the keys, you motherfucking,
           cocksucking pile of shit, or I'll rip off
           your

                         VOICE (O.S.)
           KNOCK IT OFF. Get back in line.

McManus steps back.

The rest of the men do their bit as Verbal speaks.

                It was bullshit. The whole rap was a
                setup. Everything is the cops' fault. You
                don't put guys like that in a room

                pissed about that truck getting knocked
                off and the cops had nothing. They were
                hoping somebody would slip. Give them
                something to go on. They knew we wouldn't
                fight it because they knew how to lean on
                us. They'd been doing it forever. Our
                rights went right out the window. It was
                a violation. I mean disgraceful.

           Fenster always worked with McManus. He
           was a real tight-ass, but when it came to
           the job, he was right on. Smart guy. A
           gopher. Got whatever you needed for next
           to nothing.
                            FENSTER
           You guys got nothing on me. Where's your

Fenster knocks on the table.

                 Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with

     Keaton shows just a flicker of contempt. The threat has hit
     home.

                                  KEATON
                Like I said. It was all your mistake.
                Charge me with it and I'll beat it. Let's
                get back to the truck.

     A FIST flies into the frame and connects with Keaton's jaw.
     His head snaps back, blood flowing freely from his mouth.

     Keaton is brought in to a holding where he joins Fenster,
     Hockney, Verbal and McManus. He sits in a corner and keeps to
     himself.

     Fenster is in mid-tirade.

                                  FENSTER
                Somebody should do something. What is

                minutes? Okay, so I did a little time,                    
                does that mean I get railed every time a

     McManus is silently staring at Keaton, who sits on a bench,
     looking away.

                            McMANUS

Keaton shoots McManus a fiery glare.

           I'd say you've gotten on his main and

           the hell is a voice line-.up? A public

           It was the Feds. A truck load of guns
           gets snagged, Customs comes down on
           N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up

                            McMANUS  
           Nobody asked you, workin'-man.

                            HOCKNEY
           Fuck who did it. What I want to know is,
           who's the gimp?

ALL EYES suddenly turn on Verbal. He has been quietly
listening the whole time without uttering a word.

                             KEATON
           He's alright.

                            HOCKNEY
           How do I know that? How about it,
           pretzel-man? What's your story?

                            KEATON
           His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you
           guys knew him.

                            McMANUS
           Verbal?

                            VERBAL
           Roger really. People say I talk too much.

                            HOCKNEY
           Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.

                            KEATON
           We've met once or twice. Last time was
           in...

                             VERBAL
           County. I was in for fraud.

                            KEATON
           You were waiting for a line-up then, too.
           What happened with that?

                            VERBAL
        I walked. Ninety days, suspended.

                             HOCKNEY
            So you did it?


                             VERBAL
            To your mother's ass.

 Verbal looks away from Hockney, awaiting a violent response.
 Everyone slowly starts to laugh. Hockney looks as if he is
 about to boil in his own skin.

                              KEATON
                          (To Hockney)
            Let it go.

 Verbal smiles at Keaton appreciatively.

 McManus stands and walks to the toilet in the corner of
 the cell. He starts taking a leak;

                              McMANUS
            Look, we've all been put out by this, I
            figure we owe it to ourselves to salvage
            a little dignity. Now Fenster and I got
            wind of a possible job -

                              KEATON
            Why don't you just calm down'

                             HOCKNEY
            What do you care what he says?

                             McMANUS
           Yeah, I'm just talking here, and Hockney
           seems to want to hear me out. I know
           Fenster is with me -
                           (To Verbal)
           How about you, guy?

McManus finishes pissing.


                            VERBAL
           I'm interested, sure.


                             McMANUS
           There, so you see, I'm going to exercise
           my right to free assembly.

McManus taps the bars of his cell and the others LAUGH.

                              KEATON
           I'm not kidding. Shut your mouth.

                 Dean Keaton, gone the high road. What is
                 the world coming to?

     McManus and Keaton stare at one another for a long and tense
     moment. Finally McManus turns to the others.

                             McMANUS (CONT'D)
                 Forget him then.

                 Now I can't talk about this here in any
                 detail, but listen up...

     Everyone but Keaton gravitates toward McManus's cell as he
     begins to speak in low, hushed tones.

                              VERBAL (V.O.)
                 And that was how it began. The five of us
                 brought in on a trumped-up charge to be
                 leaned on by half-wits. What the cops
                 never figured out, and what I know now,
                 was that these men would never break,
                 never lie down, never bend over for
                 anybody. .. Anybody.

19    EXT. PIER - DAY - SAN PEDRO - PRESENT DAY                          19
     It is morning in the aftermath of the opening scene.
     Harsh sunlight shines on a line of body bags on the dock.

     Police swarm everywhere, photographers are taking pictures of
     the scene while a team of men in rolled up sleeves and
     plastic gloves pick at the remains.

     Two men on a fire boat operate a water cannon, dousing the
     smoldering remains of a burned-out ships hull.

     Watching this from the edge of the pier is a man in a dark
     suit. He is SPECIAL AGENT JACK BAER of the F.B.I. He is tall
     and fit, in his late thirties. He gazes out over the water
     thoughtfully.

A UNIFORM COP trots up to him.
                              COP
           Who are you?


Baer holds up his badge without looking at the man.

                              BAER
           Agent Jack Baer, F.B.I. How many dead?

Before the cop can answer, Baer turns and walks along the
line of body bags.

                              COP
           Fifteen so far. We're still pulling some
           bodies out of the water.

Baer eyes the corpses on the dock, burned beyond recognition.

                              COP
           Looking for anyone in particular?

Baer looks at the cop for the first time, unamused.

                              BAER
           f don't want any of the bodies taken away
           until I've had a chance to go over this,
           understood?

                              COP
           I have to clear the scene. I've got word
           direct from the Chief

Baer lights a cigarette, only half listening.

                              BAER
                         (Unimpressed)
           Yes, the chief. Spooky stuff. Any
           survivors?

                              COP
           Two. There's a guy in county hospital,
           but he's in a coma. The D.A. has the
           other guy - A cripple - from New York I
           think. Listen, the Chief said -

                              BAER
           Excuse me.

Baer walks away from the cop, ignoring him completely. He
wanders through the carnage on the pier.

     A half mile out from the pier.

     The sea is choppy, stirred by the wind. An object floats into
     view a few feet away, bobbing in the water.

     It is A DEAD BODY - a man, face down, wearing a CHECKERED
     BATHROBE. He drifts quietly toward the open ocean.

21    INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY - LOS ANGELES PRESENT                      2: 

     Verbal Kint sits in a chair in front of a microphone attached
     to a tape recorder, his brow beaded with sweat.

     On the wall behind him is the seal of the STATE OF CALIFORNIA

     He is cleaner, better kept, in a well-cut suit and neatly
     trimmed hair. He looks older than he did in New York - worn
     down.

     A flurry of voices banter off screen. Verbal's eyes follow
     the voices back and forth.

                May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your
                political power as much as I respect it.
                I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many
                faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't
                care. The embarrassment he helped cause

           Then prosecute. I will be very impressed

           to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous
           counts of murder against one man with
           cerebral palsy. I would think a man with

           mention.

     David Kujan is walking quickly beside SERGEANT RABIN, a dark
     and weathered looking man in his late thirties. They move up
     a staircase into the heart of police headquarters.

                The D.A. came down here last night ready
                to arraign before they even moved him to
                county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five
                minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking
                like he'd been bitch-slapped by the
                boogey man. They took his statement and
                cut him a deal.

                                  KUJAN
                Did they charge him with anything?

     Rabin motions for Kujan to lower his voice. He points out
     that they are walking through a bullpen filled with desks
     where a number of other police are working within earshot.

                                  RABIN
                I give the D.A. credit for getting that
                much to stick. This whole thing has
                turned political. The Mayor was here -
                the chief - the Governor called this

           I want to see him.

Rabin comes to an office door with his name on it. He opens
it and lets Kujan in before following.

                                  RABIN                                 +
                Dave, please.                                            

     Rabin's office can only be described as a disaster area. The        
     desk is cluttered with weeks, perhaps months or even years of       
     paperwork that could never conceivably be sorted out.               

     Above his desk is a bulletin board. It is a breathtaking
     catastrophe of papers, wanted posters, rap-sheets, memos and +
     post-its. This is in the neighborhood of decades. Rabin is a
     man with a system so cryptic, so far beyond the comprehension       
     of others, he himself is most likely baffled by it.                 

                             RABIN (CONT'D)                              
                Even if I was to let you talk to him, he                 
                won't talk to you. He's paranoid about                   
                being recorded and he knows the                          
                interrogation rooms are wired

                friendly chat to kill time.

     Kujan looks around Rabin's messy office.                            

                             RABIN (CONT'D)
                No, no, no, no, no.

                                   KUJAN
                If it was a dope deal, where's the dope,                 
                if it was a hit, who called it in?

                theories to answer these questions.

              That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter.
              He has total immunity and his story
              checks out. He doesn't know what you want
              to know.

                    				KUJAN
              I don't think he does. Not exactly, but
              there's a lot more to his story. I want
              to know why twenty-seven men died on that
              pier for what looks to be ninety-one
              million dollars worth of dope that wasn't
              there. Above all, I want to be sure that
              Dean Keaton is dead.

                	  	      		RAB ZN
              He's dead.

     A door marked INTENSIVE CARE.
     The door BURSTS OPEN. SUDDENLY, the hallway is a flurry of
     activity.
     DOCTOR LISA PLUMBER, age fifty, walks quickly beside JACK
     BAER .
     Baer walks with all of the determination of a battalion of
     Chinese infantry.

     DOCTOR RIDGLY WALTERS, a young intern in his late twenties
     rushes up to them.

                                 PLUMBER
                Ridgly, this is Special Agent Jack Baer
                from the F.B.I. Agent Baer, this is
                Doctor Ridgly Waiters.

                                 RIDGLY
                Nice to meet you.

                                  BAER
                Is he talking?

                                 RIDGLY
                He regained consciousness less than an
                hour ago. He spoke - not English - then
                he lapsed.

                                  BAER
                Hungarian?

                                   BAER
                 It was Hungarian. Most of them were
                 Hungarians. Any fluent Hungarians on your
                 staff?

                                  RIDGLY

     Ridgly opens a door and Baer barrels through.

                 There's a chance.

     Baer walks over to Rovash and kneels down on the bed beside
     him.

     He looks closely at his battered and scalded face. He listens
     to him far a moment. Kovash goes on incessantly.

Baer pulls a cellular phone out of his jacket and dials.
                             BAER
           Call hospital security and put a man on
           the door until the police get here.

Ridgly runs out of the room. Kovash babbles louder and
louder, trying to get Baer's attention. Baer sticks a finger
in one ear to block him out and hear the phone.

                            PLUMBER
           Is he dangerous?

                             BAER
           Yes.

Someone picks up on the other end of the phone.

                         BAER (CONT'D)
           Joel, it's Baer. I'm down at L.A. county.
           The guy they pulled out of the harbor is
           ARKOSH Kovash... Yes, I'm sure... No,
           he's all fucked up... What? I can't hear
           you.
                          (To Arkosh)
           Shut up, Hugo, I'm on the phone.
                         (Into Phone)
           Yes... No... Not until I put someone on
           him. Listen, I need you to send me
           someone who can speak Hungarian. He's
           awake and talking like a Thai hooker...
           How should I know? Get me someone who can
           talk to him -

Baer is suddenly distracted by something Kovash has said. In
the middle of a long string of unintelligible dialect, he has
spouted two words that have gotten Baer's attention.

He turns and looks down at the tattered man in the bed.
Kovash realizes Baer is listening and says the two words
again.

                             KOVASH
           Keyser - Soze.                                               

                              BAER
           What?

He waves his hand, gesturing for Kovash to say it again.

                            KOVASH
           Keyser - Soze.

                              BAER
           No shit?

      Rabin walks out of a small room. Behind him, we catch a
      glimpse of a workroom with a bench covered with wires.

      Kujan comes out a moment later, gently fixing his tie.

      Rabin opens the door to his office and Kujan enters. Rabin 
      follows, looking up and down the hall before closing the door
      behind them.

      As the door closes we can just make out the back of Verbal's
      head. He is seated in Rabin's office, smoking a cigarette.

     Rabin stands over LOUIS, a messy looking technician at his
     workbench in a room full of electronic equipment. He adjusts
     several dials on a receiver until the voices of Kujan and
     Verbal come clearly through a tinny speaker on the wall.
     Rabin reaches over for a nearby pot of coffee.

 Kujan picks it up and thumbs through it.

                           (smiling)
            You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer,
            Verbal?

                             VERBAL
            You know a religious guy named John Paul?

                              KUJAN
            You know Ruby is in Attica? 

                       VERBAL
           He didn't have my lawyer.

                              KUJAN
           I know Ruby. He's very big on respect.
           Likes me very much.

Verbal sees this getting to something. His smiles fades.

                        KUJAN (CONT'D)
           Now I know your testimony was sealed.
           Ruby is well connected. He still has
           people running errands for him. What do
           you think he'd say if he found out you
           dropped his name to the D.A.?

                             VERBAL
           There's nothing in there about Ruby.

                             KUJAN
           I'11 be sure to mention that to him.

Verbal is not smiling anymore. He stares at Kujan with utter
contempt, knowing he is being shafted.

                         KUJAN (CONT'D)
           The first thing I learned on the job,
           know what it was? How to spot a murderer.
           Let's say you arrest three guys for the
           same killing. Put them all in jail
           overnight. The next morning, whoever is
           sleeping is your man. If you're guilty,
           you know you're caught, you get some rest
           - let your guard down, you follow?

                            VERBAL
           No.

                             KUJAN
           I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter
           than you. I'11 find out what I want to
           know and I'11 get it from you whether you
           like it or not.

                            VERBAL
           I'm not a rat.

Kujan puts his hand on the transcript of Verbal's confession.
Rabin walks in with a cup of coffee. Verbal takes it with his
good hand and sips it with a relish.

                         VERBAL (CONT'D)
           Ahhh. Back when I was picking beans in
           Guatemala we used to make fresh coffee.
           Right off the trees I mean. That was
           good. This is shit, but hey...

                             RAB IN
           Can we get started again?

                             KUJAN
           Now what happened after the line-up?

Verbal sneers at Kujan, unable to change the subject.

30    EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT - NEW YORK - SIX WEEKS PRIOR         30

     Keaton stops at the top of the front steps of the police
     station and lights a cigarette. Edie comes out behind him,
     fuming mad.

                                   EDIE
                ...and the desk Sergeant is actually
                trying to tell me he can't release you?
                Can you believe that? You weren't even
                charged. New York police - Jesus. I want
                to take pictures of your face to bring to
                the D.A. first thing in the morning.

                                 KEATON
                Just forget about it.

     He looks across the street and sees Fenster and McManus
     talking by a newsstand. McManus is thumbing through
     magazines.

                                   EDIE
                Absolutely not.

     Keaton looks to his right and sees Hockney trying to hail a
     cab.

                              EDIE (CONT'D)
                I'11 have this thing in front of a grand
                jury by Monday.

                                  KEATON
                Edie, please. I don't want to hear this
                right now. What did Renault and Fortier                    
                say?

                                   EDIE
                They want more time to think about

                They just said they wanted time.

                                   KEATON
                Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me
                a little more, that's what. No matter how
                well you cover my tracks now, they'll
                find out who I am.

                              EDIE
           Give me some credit. I got you this far,
           let's go to the grand jury. This is never
           going to stop if we -

                             KEATON
           No. It's never going to stop, period. It
           won't take more than a week before every
           investor in this city is walking away
           from us. It's finished. I'm finished.

Just then, Verbal bumps into him on his way out the door. He
excuses himself and hobbles down the steps, oblivious to who
he has bumped into as he tries to navigate the stairs.

                              EDIE
           Don't give up on me now, Dean.

                            KEATON
           They'll never stop.

                             EDIE
           I love you.

                             KEATON
                          (To himself)
           They ruined me tonight.

                              EDIE
           Dean, I love you. Do you hear me?

Verbal gets to the sidewalk and stops. He turns, realizing it
is Keaton on the steps.

                         EDIE (CONT'D)
           Let's just go to my place. We'll worry
           about this tomorrow.

Keaton and Verbal look at one another for a moment. Keaton
then looks over to the newsstand and sees Fenster looking at
him.

                            KEATON
           Huh?

McManus notices Fenster and glances up from his magazine to
see what he is looking at.                                             +

                              EDIE
           Come home with me, please. Dean?

      Keaton looks at Hockney who has one foot in a cab. He is
      looking at Fenster and McManus who are looking at Keaton.
      This makes Hockney look up at Keaton as well.

      SUDDENLY, Edie tunes in to what is going on. She notices the
      others on the street. She reaches over and takes Keaton by
      the arm, pulling gently. She glares at the others.

                                   EDIE
                Come home, Dean.

                                  KEATON
                                (Distant)
                Alright.

      Verbal looks at everyone else from where he stands on the
      street. Fenster, McManus and Hockney all look at him and then
      at each other. It is a strange moment of unspoken
      understanding.

      All eyes finally turn to Keaton, high on the front steps of
      the police station as he walks away with Edie.

31    INT. HALLWAY - DAY                                                   31

      Verbal stands in front of an apartment door. He hesitates for
      a long moment before he knocks.

      After a moment, the door opens and Keaton stands on the other
      side of it. He is wearing a bathrobe and smoking a cigarette.

      He looks at Verbal without any expression whatsoever.

                                  KEATON
                What are you doing here'! How did you find
                me?


                                  VERBAL
                I just asked one of the detectives
                downtown. He seemed pretty happy to tell

                me.
      Keaton curses under his breath and motions for Verbal to come
      in.
                                                                            32
32    INT. EDIE'S APARTMENT


      Verbal walks in and sits down on the couch, watching Keaton
      cautiously. He looks around the large apartment, beautifully
      furnished and decorated.

Edie walks into the room in a man's button-down shirt and
sweat pants.

nervously.

           How do you do?

                             KEATON
           Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran.
           Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at

           I know who he is.

                             VERBAL
           I hope I didn't disturb you.

                             EDIE
           I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you
           something to drink?

                             VERBAL
           A glass of water would be nice.

Edie shoots a look at Keaton on her way out of the room.
Keaton tries to hush his voice despite his anger.

                             KEATON
           What the hell do you want?

                             VERBAL
           I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -

                             KEATON
           I did you a favor by standing up for you
           last night, but don't think we're
           friends. I'm sorry, but I have other
           things -

           They're gonna do a job. Three million
           dollars, maybe more.

Keaton is speechless. Verbal sits on the couch again.

                        VERBAL (CONT'D)
           They sent me to offer you a cut. We could
           use a fifth man - a driver - That's all
           you'll do.

Edie walks in with a glass of ice water and hands it to
Verbal.

                       VERBAL (CONT'D)
           Thank you.

Verbal drinks slowly. Edie stands over him, her face blank.
It is an awkward moment. She deliberately makes Verbal
uncomfortable.

LONG PAUSE - FINALLY:


                              EDIE
           So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?

                            VERBAL
           Umm ...

                              EDIE
           A hijacker like Dean, here? Or something
           more creative?

                            KEATON

           I don't know what you came here for, but
           we won't have any part of it.

                            KEATON
           Edie, please.

Keaton takes Edie by the arm and tries to guide her toward
the other room. She pulls away, anger turning to rage.

                              EDIE
           I've spent the last year of my life
           putting his back together again - I won't
           have you come in here and - What makes
           you think - GET OUT. GET OUT OF m HOME.
           HOW DARE YOU COME HERE?

Keaton is pulling her now. She yanks her arm away and shoves
him.

           Don't touch me. Just don't,

She turns and walks out of the room. Somewhere in the back of
the apartment, a door slams.

Keaton turns and glares at Verbal. Verbal cringes.

                            KEATON
           Get out.

SUDDENLY, KEATON LUNGES. He grabs Verbal by the lapels and
lifts him off the couch, moving him effortlessly across the
room and slamming him into the wall next to the front door.
He opens it.

           You have to come.

                             KEATON
           What's with you? What do you care whether
           I come or not?


                             VERBAL
           They - They don't know me. You do. They
           won't take me unless you go. Look at me.
           I need this.

                            KEATON
           Tough break.

                             VERBAL
           Don't tell me you don't need this. Is
           this your place?

Keaton is unable to answer.


                        VERBAL (CONT'D)
           They're never going to stop with us, you
           know that. This way we hit the cops where
           it hurts and get well in the mean time.

Keaton lets Verbal go and steps back, thinking.

                        VERBAL (CONT'D)
           As clean as you could ever get, they'll
           never let you go now.

                        VERBAL (cont'd)
           I'm not knocking you. You look like
           you've got a good little seam going with
           this lawyer -

WHAM. Keaton punches Verbal in the stomach and drops him to
one knee. Verbal coughs and tries to find his breath.

                             KEATON
           You watch your mouth.

                             VERBAL
                            (Gasping)
           Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing?
           That's cool.

Keaton reaches for Verbal. Verbal flinches. Keaton gently
helps him up and guides him to the couch. They bath sit.

Keaton reaches for a pack of cigarettes and lights one for
each of them.

                            KEATON
           I apologize.

Verbal takes one and has a few drags, catching his breath and
rubbing his stomach in pain.

FINALLY:

                            VERBAL
           I was out of line.

                             KEATON
           You okay?

                            VERBAL
           I'11 be alright.

                             KEATON
           Well, I'm sorry.

                             VERBAL
           Forget it.
                             (Beat)
           I'11 probably shit blood tonight.

Keaton laughs. Verbal thinks about it for a moment and laughs
with him.

Keaton's laughter trails off. He thinks for a moment.

                                   KEATON
                 How are they going to do it?

                                   VERBAL
                 McManus wants to go in shooting. I said
                 no way.

                                  KEATON
                 Fenster and Hockney?

                                   VERBAL
                 They're pretty pissed off. They'll do
                 anything. Now I got a way to do it
                 without killing anyone:
                                           but like I said,
                 they won't let me in without you.

                                   KEATON
                 Three million?

                                  VERBAL
                 Maybe more.

                                   KEATON
                 No killing?

                                  VERBAL
                 Not if we do it my way.

     LONG PAUSE


                                   KEATON
                             (Lost in thought)
                 I swore I'd live above myself.

     Verbal smiles, knowing he has him.

                 New York's finest Taxi Service was not
                 your normal taxi service. It was a ring
                 of corrupt cops in the N.Y.P.D. that ran
                 a high-profit racket, driving smugglers
                 and drug dealers all over the city. For a
                 few hundred dollars a mile, you got your
                 own black and white and a police escort.
                 They even had their own business cards.

     OSCAR WHITEHEAD, a tall gray-haired man in his fifties comes
     out of the international terminal in a white linen suit. He
     holds a large suitcase in his right hand.

                              VERBAL (V.O.)
                After a while, somebody started asking
                questions and the taxi service shut down.
                Ever since then, Internal Affairs had
                been waiting to catch them in the act.

     Oscar stands on the curb long enough to light a cigarette.
     After a moment, a POLICE CRUISER pulls up to him. He opens
     the back door and gets in.

                              VERBAL (V.O.)
                And that was how we started. McManus came
                to us with the job; Fenster got the vans;
                Hockney supplied the hardware; 'I came
                through with how to do it so no one got
                killed - but Keaton - Keaton put on the
                finishing touch. A little &quot;Fuck you&quot; from
                the five of us to the N.Y.P.D.

     The car drives out of the airport. A VAN follows at a                
     distance.

34    INT. POLICE CAR                                                      34

     SERGEANT JIM STRAUSZ, a meaty, imposing looking man in his
     forties drives the car. Beside him is a thin, greasy looking
     PATROLMAN, STEVE RIZZI. They are two drivers for New York's
     Finest Taxi Service.

                                  RIZZI
                How was the flight?

     Oscar hands Rizzi a thick envelope.

                                   OSCAR
                Will that get me to the Pierre?

     Rizzi counts the stack of hundred dollar bills in the
     envelope .

                                  RIZZI
                That'll get you to Cape God.

     The two men laugh. Strausz watches the road, expressionless.
35 EXT. HIGHWAY                                                            35
     The cruiser heads towards the heart of Manhattan.

      The police car makes its way down a wide, abandoned street. A
      WHITE MINIVAN pulls out behind it and heads the same way.

37 INT. POLICE CAR
                                                                            37

      Strausz looks in the rear-view mirror. The white minivan is
      flashing his high-beams.

                                  STRAUSZ
                 What the

                                   RIZZI
                 LOOK OUT.

      Strausz looks in front of him. A green minivan swerves in
      front of them from out of nowhere. Strausz slams on the
      brakes and skids to a halt. The white minivan rams them from
      behind.

      Strausz and Rizzi are stunned for a moment as two more vans
      screech up on either side of the cruiser, boxing it in with
      only a few inches between them.

      The cruiser is surrounded on all sides.

      SUDDENLY, SHOTGUN BARRELS come through the open windows. They
      come to rest, one on Strausz's left temple one on Rizzi's
      right. RIZZI looks out of the corner of his eye.

      He sees the driver of the van next to him holding the shotgun
      with one hand. A stocking is over the driver's head.

      Strausz looks straight ahead. The minivan in front of them is
      missing a back window. Another man with a stocking on his
      head aims a sub-machine gun at them from inside.

      By the twisted right hand holding the front of the gun, we
      know it is Verbal.

      Strausz and Rizzi raise their hands without being asked.

38    EXT. STREET                                                           38

      The driver of the white van gets out with a gallon jug in one
      hand and a sledge hammer in the other.

      Moving like lightning, he jumps onto the roof of the police
      car

     'He stands on the front of the roof and swings the hammer
     down.

     SMASH

     The hammer punches three huge holes in the windshield and
     finally caves it in. Strausz and Rizzi are covered with
     pebbles of broken glass. Whitehead clutches his bag in the
     back seat. He trembles in terror.

     The man standing on the roof doubles over and sticks a gun in
     Strausz's face. His face hangs upside down and looks gruesome
     - covered from the mouth up in a stocking. By the voice, we
     know it is McManus.

                                  McManus
                 GIVE ME THE SHIT.

                                  STRAUSZ
                 Give it up.

     Oscar hands the suitcase up front and Strausz passes it to
     McManus.

40 INT. FRONT VAN

     Through the front windshield of the front van we see Keaton
     at the wheel. Verbal is behind him leaning out the back
     window.

     Beneath Keaton's stocking mask we see he is trembling and
     sweating - sickened by what he is doing.

     He glances up at the rear-view mirror and looks at the scene
     outside. He looks down at the floor in shame, shaking his
     head.

41 INT. POLICE CAR                                                       41

                 The money.

     Strausz looks at Rizzi.

                             McMAMJS (CONT'D)
                 THE MONEY. LET'S HAVE IT.

     Rizzi hands the money through the remains of the windshield.

      McManus takes the money and stuffs it in his jacket. He steps
      back and takes the cap off of the gallon jug. He quickly
      pours some kind of liquid all over the roof of the car.

                                  STRAUSZ
                 Do you know who I am?

      A hand reaches into the driver's side window and rips
      Strausz's badge off of his shirt.

      Strausz dares to turn his head right at the shotgun pointing
      at him through the window. On the other end is a masked and
      smiling Todd Hockney.

                                  HOCKNEY
                 We db now, Jerk-off.

      McManus lights a pack of matches and drops them on the roof
      of the car as he jumps off. THE LIQUID IGNITES, the roof of
      the car is instantly in flames.

      Strausz and Rizzi attempt to bail out, but the vans are too
      close for them to open the doors.

      The vans pull away.
      Strausz and Rizzi escape from the car.
      Oscar is trapped inside, SCREAMING.
      Strausz and Rizzi stop, each expecting the other to go let
      Oscar out.

      The scene is swarming with fresh police cars. Strausz and
      Rizzi are fielding questions from a dozen other cops.

      Photographers are everywhere.

                              VERBAL (V.O.)
                 The papers got Keaton's call that day and                  
                 were on the scene before the cops were.
                 Strausz and Rizzi were indicted three
                 days later. Within a few weeks, fifty
                 more cops went down with them. It was
                 beautiful. Everybody got it right in the
                 ass, from the chief on down.

     Hockney, Fenster, McManus and Verbal are all laughing in a
     secluded garage. They are still in their black clothes from
     the robbery. Hockney is throwing everyone a can of beer.

     Keaton sits off by himself. He watches the others, unable to
     join in the festivities.

     The others sit around a cheap card table. It is covered with
     emeralds. Dozens of them. Everyone is in awe.

                                 McManus
                There's more than I thought.

                                 HOCKNEY
                When does the fence come?

                                 McMANUS
                Redfoot? He never comes to see me. I have
                to go see him.

                Yeah. It'll take a few days. Me and
                Fenster

                                 HOCKNEY
                Hold the fuckin' phone. You and Fenster?
                No, no, no.

                                 McMANUS
                Guys, come on.

                                 HOCKNEY
                I'm sure you can understand my
                hesitation.

                                 FENSTER
                Then who goes?

                                 HOCKNEY
                We all go. How about it, Keaton?

     Everyone looks at each other, their moment of distrust
     blowing over. All eyes drift back to the emeralds on the
     table.

     Hockney begins to snicker, then McManus, then Fenster. Verbal
     joins in at last.

     McManus grabs Verbal and hugs him, shaking him violently.

     He laughs as he is drenched in white foam, nearly choking as
     the others chant his name.

     Keaton watches from across the room, trying to smile in vain.

     Keaton stands and paces across the waiting room. He comes to
     a set of glass doors and looks through them.

Keaton realizes he is standing on a balcony overlooking a
library below.

      Edie is smiling and laughing with the old woman.                   
      Keaton's face is marked with guilt and anguish.
      Keaton turns and walks out of the waiting room. Verbal takes        
      one last glance at Edie and turns back to Keaton.

      Edie seems to sense something behind her. She turns and looks

      NOTHING IS THERE. She goes back to chatting with the old

          Keaton. I've been investigating him for                    
          three years. The guy I know is a cold-                    +
          blooded bastard. L.A.P.D. indicted him on                   
          three counts of murder before he was                       
          kicked off the force, so don't sell me

                            KUJAN
          Do I? Keaton was under indictment a total                 +
          of seven times when he was on the force.                  +
          In every case, witnesses either reversed                  +
          their testimony to the grand jury or died                 +
          before they could testify. When they                      t
          finally did nail him for fraud, he spent                  +
          five years in Sing Sing. He killed three                   
          prisoners inside - one with a knife in                     
          the tailbone while he strangled him to                    
          death. Of course I can't prove this but I                  
          can't prove the best part either.

          Dean Keaton was dead. Did you know that?                  r
          He died in a fire two years ago during an
          investigation into the murder of a                         
          witness who was going to testify against                   
          him. Two people saw Keaton enter a
          warehouse he owned just before it went

          up. They said he had gone in to check a                   +
          leaking gas main. It blew up and took all
          of Dean Keaton with it. Within three
          months of the explosion, the two
          witnesses were dead, one killed himself
          in his car and the other fell down an
          open elevator shaft.

                Mondino's with his lawyer, and there he
                is. Now because he never profited from
                his alleged death and because someone
                else was convicted for the murder we
                tried to pin on Keaton, we had to let him

                go.

           Keaton die. I think you're covering his
           ass and he's still out there somewhere. I
           think he was behind that whole circus in
           the harbor. My bet is he's using you
           because you're stupid and you think he's
           your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be

           harbor.

           He says they were buying It doesn't
           make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little
           rusty. They were there to buy something.

54 EXT. LOS ANGELES SKYLINE - DAY - FIVE WEEKS PRIOR

                              VERBAL (V.O.)
                McManus' fence was this guy named
                Redfoot. He had a good reputation around
                L.A. Seemed like a good guy - Looked like
                a cowhide full of thumbtacks.

55    EXT. FRIENDSHIP BELL - NIGHT                                    55'
     All five guys stand in a group. It is utterly quiet.
     An old but well kept Cadillac creeps into the lot from the
     far end and idles up to them. The windows are tinted too much
     to see in. The car passes within a few feet of them and
     drives on.

     A moment later, a chrome and leather monster of a Harley
     Davidson pulls into the lot. The rider is dressed in an
     almost comical array of leather, silver and suede.

     He waves to the Caddy as it parks a few yards from Keaton and
     the others. It sits quietly, almost menacing.

     As he gets closer, we can see he is wearing one black boot
     and one red. Keaton is still looking at them when the bike
     pulls up to them and stops.

     REDFOOT and McManus shake hands.

                                 REDFOOT
                How've you been?

                                 McMANUS
                Good. You?

                                 REDFOOT
                Alright. How's it going, Fenster?

                                 FENSTER

                            REDFOOT
           You got it?

McManus holds up a briefcase.

Redfoot takes it and gets off the bike. He walks over to the
Caddy. The door of the Caddy opens. Redfoot hands the case to
Someone inside that we cannot see. The door closes.

                             KEATON
                          (Whispering)
           Snazzy dresser this guy.

A moment later, the door of the Caddy opens again. Someone
hands Redfoot a different briefcase and he walks back over to
McManus.

He hands him the case.

McManus hands the case back to Hockney. Hockney opens it,
revealing the stacks of money inside.

                            REDFOOT
           You must be Keaton.

                             McMANUS

Verbal smiles.

                       REDFOOT (CONT'D)
           Are you guys interested in more work?

McManus moves to answer, but Keaton cuts him off.

                             KEATON
           We're on vacation.

           people.

                            McMANUS

Keaton shoots McManus a foul look. McManus pretends not to
notice.

                             McMANUS
           Give us time to check it out?

                            REDFOOT
           I'd expect nothing less.

                            McMANUS
           We'll call you.

                            REDFOOT
           Take your time. Enjoy L.A.

           knew Spook Hollis.

                             REDFOOT
           I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah,
           he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of
           dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got

                            KEATON

Now McManus is shooting the angry look at Keaton.

                        KEATON (CONT'D)

           somebody else later.

           interested.

Redfoot fires up his bike and takes off with the Caddy close
behind.

                            McMANUS
                          (To Keaton)

                            KEATON
           This is bullshit.

McManus laughs and walks away. Fenster and Hockney follow.
Verbal turns to Keaton.

           I ever tell you about the restaurant I
           wanted to open?

Keaton walks off. Verbal follows him in confusion.

                         VERBAL (V.O.)
           L.A., was good for about two hours. We
           were from New York. There's no place to
           eat after one; you can't get a pizza that
           doesn't taste like a fried fruit-bat, and
           the broads don't want to know you if you
           don't look like a broad. Within a few
           days the last of us was ready to go back
           to N.Y., but Keaton wouldn't have it, so
           he really didn't have a choice. We went
           to work.

56   INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

     McManus walks along a line of cars. He comes across a black
     Mercedes and stops. He looks down at the license plate and
     walks over to the next car, a green Honda. He pulls a slim-
     jim out of his jacket and pops the lock an the Honda. He
     reaches in and opens the hood. He walks around and sticks his
     head in the engine.

57   INT. VAN                                                             57

     Verbal sits behind the wheel. Keaton is beside him. Hockney
     and Fenster are in the back. They all watch McManus from
     where they are parked a few dozen yards away.

58   INT. PARKING GARAGE                                                  58
     DING-DING
     The elevator bell sounds at the far end of the garage. The
     doors open. Two men in ill-fitting suits get out and look
     around cautiously. The first is TUCCI, a big bellied, white
     haired menace. The other is HIGHAM, lean and bad skinned.
     They are bodyguards and give it away by their every careful
     move.

     They turn back to the elevator and motion to someone inside.

     Out walks SAUL BERG, a slightly overweight man in his forties
     with an open collar silk shirt and a thick gold chain on his
     hairy chest. He carries a LARGE ALUMINUM BRIEFCASE.

     He lets his guards do the worrying. He walks straight to his
     car.
     Saul passes McManus under the hood of the Honda. He takes out
     his keys and pushes a button on his key chain. The Mercedes
     beeps three times and tells Saul his alarm is off.

     Tucci keeps an eye on McManus. Higham watches Saul.

     McManus pretends to tinker with the car's engine. He has put  
     a pistol just inside the grill and keeps it within reach.

     The van on the other side of the garage starts and pulls out
     of the spot. It cruises over toward the Mercedes.

     Tucci sees the van. He and Higham are suddenly busy trying to
     keep track. They hear laughing behind them and turn around.

FENSTER and HOCKNEY are walking towards them. They are
sporting mustaches and sunglasses in addition to matching
suits, each with loud plaid sport coats, decades out of
style. Saul glances at Tucci and Higham.

                            HIGHAM
           Just get in the car Saul.

Under the hood of the Honda and out of sight, McManus pulls
on a black ski mask.

The van gets closer.

                             HOCKNEY
           I get out of the car, and man if the
           thing wasn't wrecked. And I see this
           broad in the back seat with nothing on.

Saul gets in the car quickly but calmly as Fenster and
Hockney laugh and talk louder. They look drunk - The desired
effect.

                       HOCKNEY (CONT'D)
           I'm laughing so hard I can't breathe -

Tucci and Higham try to take it all in stride. Saul's reverse
lights come on and he begins to back out of the spot.

                       HOCKNEY (CONT'D)
           ...And the fat guy comes out of the car
           with his pants on backwards and says -

SUDDENLY, the van revs and screeches to a halt behind Saul's
Mercedes, blocking him in. Hockney and Fenster drop the drunk
act and snap to. They both pull out guns and start screaming.

                       HOCKNEY (CONT'D)
           DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.

                            FENSTER
           RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.

McManus comes up from under the hood.                                  

Tucci and Higham throw their hands in the air. Hockney and
Fenster grab them and reach into their belts to get their
guns .

Keaton jumps out of the van and runs up to Saul's car, his
face covered in a ski mask. He yanks on the door handle but
it is locked. Saul sits in terror behind the wheel. Keaton
pulls out a pistol and smashes the window with it.

                                           YELLOW 06/11/94

                             KEATON
            Give me the case.


Saul reaches over for the case. Keaton trains the gun on him.

SUDDENLY, Saul comes up with a pistol and points it at
Keaton. Keaton sidesteps and grabs his wrist. The gun goes
off into the fender of the Honda.

Hockney and Fenster both look over at the sound of the gun.

Tucci and Higham seize the opportunity. Tucci grabs Hockney,
Higham grabs Fenster. The four men grapple for the guns.

Fenster's gun falls to the floor. McManus picks it up. He
trains a pistol on each bodyguard and takes a breath. They
are some ten feet apart and moving erratically. Hockney and
Fenster constantly fall in the line of fire.

McManus walks around the four men, keeping a pistol trained
on each of the guards. Finally he comes to an angle where
they are all in front of him. One guard is a few feet away,
the other is ten feet past him.

McMANUS' P.O.V.

The closer of the two moves in and out of the sights of the
pistol in McManus' right hand, the one farther away does the
same with the left.

Verbal gets out of the van and moves towards them to help.
BOOM
Both of McManus' guns go off like one shot. Tucci and Higham
collapse, each with a bullet in his head


PAUSE

The only sound is Saul grappling with Keaton for the gun. His
arm is halfway out the window. His elbow rests in the door
frame.

Keaton cannot get the gun out of his hand. Finally, he pushes
down with all his weight. Saul's elbow breaks backwards on
the door frame. He screams in agony. The gun falls from his
hand.

                                                  BLUE 06/01/94

      All five of the men look at each other for an impossibly long
      moment. The confusion is only aggravated by Saul's screaming.

      SLOWLY, Keaton raises his pistol and aims it at Saul. His
      hand trembles, his eyes squint to near slits. His finger
      tenses and slacks off over and over again on the trigger.

      BOOM

      VERBAL SHOOTS SAUL. Keaton looks at him in surprise. Verbal
      trembles more than he does.

      The garage is silent.

                                 HOCKNEY
                What the hell?

                                 McManus
                Bad day. Fuck it.

      DING-DING


      The elevator light comes on. All five men look.

                                 KEATON
                Move.

      Keaton reaches into the car and grabs Saul's case. Everyone
      else piles into the van. Keaton gets in as Verbal is driving
      for the exit.

59    INT. VAN                                                             59

      The mood in the van is grim. Everyone is silent. Keaton pops
      the clasps on the case and opens it.

                                 KEATON
                Son of a bitch.

      Everyone looks in the case. It is filled with cash on one
      side. The other side is filled with clear plastic bags of
      WHITE POWDER.

      Keaton and the others stand in silhouette in front of the
      lights of an oncoming car in the distance. We can make out
      McManus loading a gun.                                                 +

                What are you doing?

                             McMANUS
           What does it look like? I'm going to kill
           him.

                             KEATON
           We did it your way. Now I'11 deal with
           him.

                            MCMANUS
           You gonna kill him?

                            KEATON
           I'm going to deal with him.

The car, Redfoot's escort Caddy, is now in front of them.
The horn lets out three short blasts.

Redfoot comes around from behind the Caddy on his motorcycle.
He gets off the bike, trying to hide a faint smile.
McManus throws Saul's case on the ground in front of him.

                             McMANUS
           What the fuck is this, Redfoot?

                            REDFOOT
           Get a grip. I didn't know.

                             KEATON
           You didn't know.

                            REDFOOT
           The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.

                            KEATON
           Who is he?

                            REDFOOT
           Some Limey. He's a middle-man for
           somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.

                            KEATON
           We want to meet him.

                            REDFOOT
           He wants to meet you. He called last
           night and asked me to set it up. What do
           I tell him'

                            KEATON
           Tell him we'll meet.

                            McMANUS
           If you're lying, Redfoot...

                            REDFOOT
           McManus, you're a real bad-ass, but get
           off my tip.

McManus lunges for Redfoot.

The Caddy doors instantly pop open and rifle barrels come
into view from within.

Fenster and Hockney draw guns and aim at the Caddy.
Keaton and Verbal grab McManus and hold him back.
Redfoot gets on his Harley, smiling defiantly.
                       REDFOOT (CONT'D)
           Real shame about Saul getting whacked.
           Lot's of cops looking for the guys that
           did it. I'm sure They'll get around to
           asking me.

He starts his bike.

     Redfoot drives off..The Caddy waits until he is completely
     out of sight before following.

     Kujan steps out into the hall, shutting the door behind him.

     Rabin.

                 Jack. What are you doing here?

                                   BAER
                 I've been looking all over for you. You
                 still after the coke that walked out of
                 that blood bath in the harbor?

                                   KUJAN
                 Yeah.

                                   BAER
                 You can stop looking. There was no coke.
                 I've been in L.A. county with a guy they

                             BAER (cont'd)
               pulled out of a drainpipe in San Pedro
               yesterday after the shoot-out. He came to                 +
               this morning and started talking. He was
               part of a Hungarian mob there to do a
               deal with a bunch of goats from
               Argentina. He says it was definitely not
               a dope deal.

                                  KUJAN
               There was ninety-one million -

                                  BAER
               We know, but our man says no way on the
               dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole
               bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the
               next' day. They had no time to negotiate
               that kind of product and no means to move
               it.

                                 KUJAN
               What was the money for?

                                  BAER
               He didn't know. No one doing the deal
               knew except a few key people. This guy
               says they were real hush about it.
               Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.

                                 KUJAN
               I don't get it.

                                   BAER
               They tell me you got the cripple from New
               York in there. He mention Keyser Soze

                                 KUJAN
               Who ?

               Who is Keyser Soze

     Verbal looks up in shock. He drops his cigarette and trembles
     at the mere mention of the name.

64 INT. HOLLYWOOD ATHLETIC CLUB - DAY - TWO WEEKS PRIOR              64'
     Keaton stands while the rest sit and listen.
                                  KEATON
                So I need to know if anyone can think of
                anybody. Somebody with power. Enough to
                possibly track us from New York.

                                  McMANUS
                Look. We've been over it for an hour now.
                I say we pack up and run. Let's go back
                to New York. At least get out of L.A.

     SUDDENLY, The sound of a man clearing his throat.
     Everyone turns to the door behind them.
     MR. KOBAYASHI a tall, slim, well groomed man stands in the
     hall. He has a briefcase in his hand. He smiles politely.


                                KOBAYASHI
                Mr. Keaton?

     Keaton stands back and lets him in. Kobayashi looks them
     over.

                           KOBAYASHI (CONT'D)
                I am Mr. Kobayashi. I've been asked by my
                employer to bring a proposal to you
                gentlemen. That must be Mr. Hockney. I
                recognize Mr. Fenster from his mug shot,
                as well as Mr. McManus.
                               (To Verbal)
                I can only assume that you are Mr. Kint.
                I believe you were the one who disposed
                of Saul. My employer sends his gratitude.
                A most unexpected benefit.

     Everyone looks at one another in shock that he would know
     this.

                                 KEATON
                What can we do for you?

                                            BLUE 06/01/94

                           KOBAYASHI
           My employer requires your services. One
           job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I
           don't expect all of you to live, but
           those who do will have ninety-one million
           dollars to divide any way they see fit.

                            KEATON
           Who's your boss?

                           KOBAYASHI
           My employer wishes to remain anonymous.

                             KEATON
           Don't jerk me off. We all know what this
           is. You don't work with me if I work with
           you without knowing who I'm working for.
           Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?

                           KOBAYASHI
           I work for Keyser Sate.                                   

A strange look crosses Keaton's face. Skepticism, mockery and
just a hint of fear. Hockney, McManus and Fenster all share
similar looks.

                            KEATON
           What is this?

                             VERBAL
           Who's Keyser Soze?                                        

                           KOBAYASHI
           I am sure you've heard a number of tall
           tales, myths and legends about Mr. Soze

           Judging by the sudden change in mood, I
           am sure the rest of your associates can
           tell you, Mr. Kint. I have come with an
           offer directly from Mr. Soze. An order                   
           actually.

                           KOBAYASHI
           In nineteen-eighty one, Mr. Keaton, you
           participated in the hijacking of a truck
           in Buffalo, New York. The cargo was raw
           steel. Steel that belonged to Mr. Soze
           and was destined for Pakistan to be used
           in a Nuclear reactor. A very profitable
           violation of U.N. Regulations. You had no
           way of knowing this, because the man
           shipping the steel was working for Mr.
           Sate without his knowledge.                               +
                             (Beat)
           Mr. Fenster and Mr. McManus hijacked a
           twin-prop cargo flight earlier this year
           out of Newark airport. The plane was
           carrying platinum and gold wiring. Also
           set for Pakistan.

           Two months ago, Mr. Hockney stole a truck
           carrying gun parts through Queens -

Everyone looks at Hockney. He smiles shyly. It occurs to them
all that he robbed the truck for which they were all arrested
in the first place.

           the state of New York. They were to be
           &quot;lost&quot; in a weigh station and routed to
           Belfast. Again, Mr. Sate using pawns who                   
           had no knowledge.

           Nine months ago, one of Mr. Soze less                      
           than intelligent couriers was taken in a
           complicated confidence seam by a cripple.
           He was relieved of sixty-two thousand
           dollars. Now
                        (To all of them)
           - It has taken us some time to find you.
           Our intention was to approach you after
           your apprehension in New York.

           You set up the line-up.

                            KOBAYASHI
           Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were                   
           not to be released until I came to see
           you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms.
           Finneran, was a bit too effective in
           expediting his release. Holding the rest
           of you became a moot point.

                            KEATON
           What about Redfoot?

                            KOBAYASHI
           Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t
           works with the same people for very long,
           and they never know who they're working
           for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no
           people.

                            FENSTER
           So why tell us?

                           KOBAYASHI
           Because you have stolen from Mr. Soze.                    
           That you did not know you stole from him
           is the only reason you are still alive,
           but he feels you owe him. You will repay
           your debt.
           
                            HOCKNEY
           Who is this guy? How do we know you work
           for Soze


                           KOBAYASHI
           I don't think that is relevant, Mr.
           Hockney. The five of you are responsible
           for the murder of Saul Berg and his
           bodyguards. Mr. Redfoot can attest to
           your involvement, and we can see to it
           that he will. He is not of your
           &quot;superior&quot; breed.

           The offer is this, gentlemen. Mr. Soze's
           primary interest, as I am sure you all
           know, is narcotics. He's been - competing

           Argentinians for several years. Competing
           with Mr. Soze has taken its toll. These
           Argentinians are negotiating the sale of
           ninety-one million dollars in cocaine in
           three days time. Needless to say, this
           purchase will revitalize the diminishing
           strength of their organization. Mr. Soze
           wants you to stop the deal. If you
           choose, you may wait until the buy.
           Whatever money changes hands is yours.
           The transaction will take place on a boat
           in San Pedro. Mr. Soze wants you to get
           to the boat and destroy the cocaine on
           board. Then you are free of your
           obligation to Mr. Soze.

                             KEATON
           Give me one good reason why I shouldn't
           kill you right now.

Kobayashi smiles and puts his briefcase on the table in front
of him.

           A gift from Mr. Soze gentlemen.

He turns and walks out of the room.

Keaton walks over to the case and opens it. He reaches in and
pulls out five thick manila envelopes, each marked in bold
black letters. &quot;KEATON&quot;, &quot;McMANUS&quot;, &quot;HOCKNEY&quot;, &quot;FENSTER&quot; and
&quot;KINT&quot;

Keaton pulls out the files, revealing a map underneath.

Keaton pulls out a large black and white photograph of
himself and his lawyer EDIE FINNERAN. They are laughing arm
in arm by a fountain in New York. He hides the photo from the
others.

                his father was German. Nobody believed he

                wouldn't. After a while they come to                      
                power, and then they come after Soze He

     The front door opens and in walks Keyser Sate. We are never         t
     allowed to see his face.

     Sate's wife lies in the corner, beaten and bruised. Her dress
     is tattered to shreds. She cannot look up at her husband.

     The three Hungarians stand to greet him. Two hold guns in
     their hands. The third holds a straight razor. He grabs
     Soze youngest boy and holds the razor to his throat.

                Soze was tough. Not to be trifled with.                   
                So they let him know they meant business.

     The Hungarian smiles. Soze's wife SCREAMS IN HORROR.                
     The Hungarian holds up a BLOOD SOAKED RAZOR.
     SUDDENLY, he grabs another child. A little girl no older than
     six.

                They tell Soze they want his territory -                  
                all his business. Soze looks over the                    +
                faces of his family... Then he showed
                these men of will what will really was.

     SUDDENLY, Soze pulls out a pistol and shoots the two men with  
     guns. He turns and aims at the third man holding his child.

     The man threatens to cut the child's throat, slicing just
     enough to draw blood.

     SOZE FIRES.

     The stunned Hungarian watches the child fall from his arms.

     Sate turns the pistol on the next child, then the next and  
     the next. He kills his children one by one in front of the
     Hungarian.

                family dead than live another day after
                this.

    SOZE walks over to his wife, crying and beaten on the floor
    and holds up her head. She gives him the strangest look. One
    of trust perhaps, saturated with fear and humiliation.

    He puts the gun between her eyes and fires.

                the rest of the mob. He kills their kids,
                he kills their wives, he kills their

                gone. Underground. No one has ever seen
                him again. He becomes a myth, a spook
                story that criminals tell their kids at
                night. If you rat on your pop, Keyser

                Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in
                God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I
                believe in God, and the only thing that
                scares me is Keyser SOZE.

                I can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser
                from Justice. He has a file on Sate in
                D.C. It's been a hobby of his for a few
                years. A lot of guys equate him to that
                reporter on the Incredible Hulk.

                On the street? A few times. Outside
                stuff. Somebody was working for a guy who
                was working for a guy who got money
                through Keyser Soze. That kind of shit.
                Could be an old badge. A hex sign to keep
                people from fucking with you back when a
                name meant something.

                Shit yeah. I got a guy trying to walk out
                of the hospital on d fried drumstick to
                get away from SOZE. I'11 run it up the

                I came clean. I told it like it happened
                on the boat. So what if I left out how I
                got there? It's got so many holes in it,
                the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty
                out my ass. So you got what you wanted
                out of me. Big fucking deal.

                 you think the pressure's coming from?
                 Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to
                 call him - knows where I am right now.
                 He's got the front burner under' your ass
                 to let me go so he can scoop me up ten
                 minutes later. Immunity was just to deal
                 with you assholes. I got a whole new
                 problem when I post bail.

                                  KUJAN
                 So why play into his hands? We can
                 protect you.

                                  VERBAL
                 Gee, thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far.
                 Extortion, coercion. You'll pardon me if
                 I ask you to kiss my pucker. The same
                 fuckers that rounded us up and sank us
                 into this mess are telling me They'll
                 bail me out? Fuck you. You think you can
                 catch Keyser Soze? You think a guy like
                 that comes this close to getting fingered
                 and sticks his head out? If he comes up
                 for anything, it will be to get rid of
                 me.
                                  (beat)
                 After that, my guess is you'll never hear
                 from him again.

     Waves pound across a stone jetty. A MAN sits fishing while
     his young son, BRANDO strolls toward the open sea. He pokes
     at rocks and seaweed with a fishing pole. He glances down at
     Something wedged between the rocks beneath his feet. He

     pokes at it. He notes the checkered pattern of the fabric
     entwined with the twisted mess. It is the bloated carcass of
     THE MAN IN THE CHECKERED BATHROBE. BRANDO pokes it's eye
     with the fishing pole. It pops.

                quartet in Skokie, Illinois.

                Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been
                nailed in Illinois for running a three
                card monte in between sets, I never would
                have took off for New York. I never
                would have met Keaton, see. That barber
                shop quartet was the reason for
                everything.

                along with every other thing I had done
                since high school, see? Aliases, middle-

                We woke up the next morning and Fenster
                was gone. He couldn't handle the idea of
                slumming for SOZE. He left a note wishing
                us good luck and took a chunk of the
                money we'd scraped together.

     McManus kneels in the sand. Hockney and Verbal stand behind
     him, staring at something in front of them.

     bullet holes. McManus stares at him, fighting any flicker of

     Keaton turns to face him and raises his head. McManus might
     as well be pointing a feather-duster.

                I can run. I got no problem with that.

                                 KEATON
                They don't seem to have a problem with it
                either.

                                 McMANUS
                Nobody runs.

                                 HOCKNEY
                This ain't my boy we're burying. I don't
                owe anybody.

                We got a deal here.

                It's payback.

                                  KEATON
                IT'S NOT PAYBACK. I don't answer to you.                   +
                It's precaution. You want payback? You
                want to run? I don't care. I'm going to
                finish this thing. Not for Fenster, not
                for anybody else, but
                for me. This Kobayashi cocksucker isn't
                going to stand over me.
                                   (Beat)
                All of you can go to hell.


     Keaton turns and digs furiously with both hands. Hockney
     takes a moment and slowly starts to do the same.

     The four men dig for Fenster. The first to find some rest.

     Verbal smokes with his good hand shaking badly.
     
                                   KUJAN
                And after they killed Fenster nobody
                would run?


                                  VERBAL
                I wanted to. I thought we could make it.

                                   KUJAN
                Why didn't you say anything?

                                  VERBAL
                I tried, believe me, but Keaton wouldn't
                have it. It was too far-fetched for him.
                Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop. To
                a cop, the explanation is never that
                complicated. It's always simple. There's

                no mystery on the street, no arch-
                criminal behind it all. If you got a dead
                guy and you think his brother did it,
                you're going to find out you're right.
                Nobody argued with Keaton. They just set
                their minds on whacking Kobayashi.

79   EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT - TWO WEEKS PRIOR                         79

     Redfoot's Harley rests on the roof of the Caddy in a mangled
     heap. The body of the Caddy is riddled with bullet holes.

     Redfoot's dead body has been shoved head-first through a hole
     in the windshield up to his waist, recognizable only by the
     trademark red boot.


                                                                           80
80   INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY


     Kobayashi walks through the front door of a plush office

     tower followed by two bodyguards. He heads toward the
     elevator, failing to notice Hockney a few feet away, reading
     a newspaper.

     We see a wire running from Hockney's ear to his collar.

                                 HOCKNEY
                He's coming up.

81   INT. HALLWAY - FORTIETH FLOOR


     Keaton, McManus and Verbal stand by the six elevators on the
     fortieth floor. They are all wearing khaki overalls and tool
     belts with walkie-talkies. They look like servicemen.


     All of the elevators have been propped open and stranded.

     McManus moves into one of the elevators. As the doors close         i
     behind him, he scrambles for the ceiling hatch.

      The elevator opens. Kobayashi and his bodyguards get on the
      elevator.

      The elevator is empty except for the three men. McManus has
      vanished. Kobayashi presses a button and they are on the way.


      SUDDENLY, the ceiling hatch opens and McManus' arm comes out.

      POP - POP. Two shots from a suppressed pistol and the guards
      drop to the floor, DEAD.
      Kobayashi looks up with surprising calm into McManus' barrel.

                 Press forty.

Verbal and McManus grab the dead bodies and drag them out of
the elevator. They drag them to the next elevator which has
been forced open, revealing an empty shaft.

           Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.

           sincerely do. You would not have been
           chosen if you were not so capable, but I
           cannot make this decision. Whatever you
           can threaten me with is... ludicrous in

     eyes never falter'.

                finish my business with Ms. Finneran
                first, won't you?

     SUDDENLY, Keaton grabs McManus' hand and pulls the gun away
     before he can shoot.

     They come to a glass office foyer. Kobayashi gestures and
     everyone looks through the glass into the lobby beyond.

     EDIE FINNERAN is talking casually with the receptionist.

     Edie glances toward the men in the hall.
     Keaton turns quickly on his heels, facing the others. From
     where Edie stands, it looks as though Kobayashi is talking to
     a group of harmless maintenance men.

     They see A LARGE MAN dressed very much like the two dead
     bodies left in the hall downstairs. The man notices Kobayashi
     and the others. He stands and stares menacingly.

                                KOBAYASHI
                Ms. Finneran's escort in Los Angeles.
                Never leaves her for a moment. I thought
                you'd like to know she was in good hands.

     Keaton's mind races for an alternative. He can find none.
     Verbal lowers his gun without being told.

                Get your rest, Gentlemen. The boat will

                unpleasant looking man in there, Ms.

                a gruesome violation before she dies. As
                will your father, Mr. Hockney. and your
                Uncle Randall in Arizona, Mr. Kint. I
                might only castrate Mr. McManus' nephew,
                David. Do I make myself clear?

     All of the men surround Kobayashi, aching to kill him.

                                KOBAYASHI
                I'11 take care of the dead men
                downstairs. We'll add them to the cost of
                Mr. Fenster. Now if you'll excuse me.

     Kobayashi walks into the office. Edie turns to greet him.
     Keaton slowly turns and watches as they shake hands and talk.
     Kobayashi says something they cannot hear and Edie laughs,
     her back to the window.

     Kobayashi smiles over her shoulder at Keaton.
     All the while, the bodyguard watches Keaton. He nods politely
     before Keaton and the others leave. Verbal watches for a
     moment more and follows.

     Keaton, Verbal, Hockney and McManus sit in a rented sedan
     overlooking San Pedro harbor.

     Another file from Kobayashi's briefcase is laid out on the
     dashboard. This has a map and a good fifty pages of                  
     information in it.

                quarters, no advance layout, ten men,
                maybe twenty.

                                 HOCKNEY
                Can we stealth these guys?

                                  KEATON
                Doubtful. With all that coke, they'll be
                ready - which brings me to sunny spot
                number two. Even if one of us gets
                through and jacks the boat, we get
                nothing.

                                  McMANUS
                And if we wait for the money?

                                  KEATON
                Ten more men at least. In my opinion, it
                can't be done. Anyone who walks into this
                won't come out alive.

                                  McMANUS
                I'm for waiting for the money.

                                 HOCKNEY
                Me too.

                                  VERBAL
                Did you hear what he just said?

                                  HOCKNEY
                If I'm going in, I want a stake.

                                  McMANUS
                 So do I.

      Verbal is shocked by what he is hearing. He looks at Keaton
      as if to ask him for his decision.

      Keaton's cold stare is all the answer Verbal needs. He slumps
      in his seat, resigned to the others.

                                  VERBAL
                 I just can't believe we're just gonna
                 walk into certain death.

      They all suddenly realize the weight of their situation.
      FINALLY:
                                  McMANUS
                 News said it's raining in New York.

      No one knows quite how to respond.

      A large boat, sleek and yacht-like, but without finesse. This
      is a boat for business - heavy and fast. It is moored to the
      pier.

      A large crane hoists a pallet of fuel drums from the dock. It
      swings slowly over the boat. A man on the dock yells in
      Spanish to the crane operator.

      Behind an old and weathered boat in dry-dock, Keaton and
      Verbal watch the boat from the shadows.

                                  VERBAL
                 What-are they speaking?

      McManus climbing up the side of the boathouse.

      Hockney maneuvers through a mesh of twisted steel, arriving
      at a vantage point near the stern of the large boat.                 

      HOCKNEY'S P.O.V.                                                     

      A black van pulls up and parks near the crane. Four men in
      suits get out. One remains with the van and the other three          
      walk toward the boat.                                                

      On the boat, five men come up from below deck. They are tense        
      and cautious around the men in suits. Someone speaks in
      Spanish and someone else in Russian. It takes a moment before
      anyone speaks the same tongue. They settle on French for both
      negotiators.

      Hockney sits in the van. He handles a large shoulder bag            +
      stuffed with plastique. He tests a timer on top.                     

      He picks up a walkie-talkie.

      McManus is positioning himself on the roof of the boathouse.         
      He stops and grabs his radio.

                 Keaton, I can't just -

                                  KEATON
                 I want you to find Edie. Both of you find
                 some place safe. Tell her what happened -
                 Everything. She knows people. She'll know
                 what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my
                 way, she'll get him her way.

                                  KEATON
                 Just do what I tell you.

     Keaton turns and takes a few steps. He stops and looks back,
     his face marked with guilt and agony.

                             KEATON (CONT'D)
                 Tell her I... Tell her I tried.

     Keaton leaves before Verbal can respond. He walks down a ramp  
     toward the boat.

     He is no more than a few yards out of the shadows before the  
     first man sees him.

     One of the men in suits starts to yell to the others. Men
     pull out guns and try to look as cool as they can.

     Keaton walks right into the face of all of these men,
     undaunted. His hands are in his pockets.

     Above him, in the darkness, McManus pokes his head out and

     spies Keaton. He pulls his head back and sticks out the
     barrel of the rifle.

     Keaton comes to a stop about twenty feet from fifteen men all
     together.

     McMANUS'S P.O.V.
     McManus stares through the scope of his rifle at the scene.
     The cross-hairs breeze past Keaton and find a target. A man
     in a suit.

                                  McMANUS
                 Pow.

     He moves to another and then another, picking up speed and
     mock-shooting the men. He is steady and quick. It is clear he
     could take all fifteen in a few seconds.

                             McMANUS (CONT'D)
                 Pow-pow-pow-pow-pow-pow . Oswald was a

     The men shout questions at Keaton in a number of languages.

     A few men standing on the dock near the stern of the large
     boat, move towards the commotion.

     Hockney bails out and runs quickly and quietly through the
     shadows, bringing the bomb with him.

     McManus still wanders with his scope.
                                  McMANUS
                 Old McDonald had a farm, ee-aye, ee-aye,

     Finally two men walk right towards Keaton. The rest train
     guns on him. They reach for his arms, pointing their guns
     right at him.

     At the far end of the dock, Hockney throws his bomb onto the
     stern of the large boat.

     IT EXPLODES                                                          
     The men surrounding Keaton, are distracted.
     Keaton pulls a pistol out of each pocket and shoots the two
     men closest to him.

     McManus runs across the roof of the boathouse and jumps down
     to the pier. He arrives at a thick mooring cable and climbs
     across to the boat.                                                 i

      Hockney is firing in all directions.
      SUDDENLY, he realizes no one is left on the dock.

      PAUSE  

      FINALLY, he turns and runs back for the van parked on the
      pier above. He finds a ramp leading from the dock to the
      pier.  

      At the van, he finds the one man who has stayed behind to

      He shoots the man point blank in the face and runs over his
      body as it falls.

      He gets to the back door of the van and yanks it open.

      The inside is stacked with large wooden crates.

      Hockney, suddenly oblivious to the sound of gunfire, opens
      one of the crates and looks inside.

      IT IS FILLED WITH MONEY. Cash and negotiable bonds of all
      kinds.

      He smiles.
      BOOM
      BLOOD sprays all over the money. Hockney looks at it,
      puzzled.

      Hockney raises a blood-soaked hand from his belly.

     McManus runs like a wild man across the deck, heading for the
     hatch .

     He shoots in all directions as though he has eyes in the back
     of his head. He sees Keaton climbing onto the deck of the
     boat.

     for the other side of the boathouse.

     The crane continues to swing.
     A single bullet hits one of the barrels on the suspended
     pellet.

     Gasoline pours out through the bullet-hole.

     Keaton finds the hatch and goes below, shooting a man on his
     way up the stairs. McManus jumps on board and runs down
     behind him.

     the bowels of the boat and the hum of the crane.

                thought about Keaton. It looked like he

                A boy came across a body on the beach
                this morning. Thrown clear when the boat                  
                burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys                   
                from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     +

                His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty
                smuggler out of Argentina. He was
                arrested in New York last year for
                trafficking. He escaped to California and
                got picked up in Long Beach. They were
                setting up his extradition when he
                escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran
                was called in to advise the proceedings.

124  INT. BOAT - NIGHT - ONE WEEK PRIOR                               124

     Keaton is weaving through tight, low-ceiling corridors,
     looking in every cabin, working his way towards the bottom of
     the boat.

     ELSEWHERE IN THE BOAT, McManus is tearing though the
     corridors, seemingly less interested in securing the cargo as
     he is in killing everyone on board.

     He screams like a lunatic, shooting everything in his path,
     killing some men with his bare hands, shooting others,
     stabbing others still with a knife he has brought along.

                                                                      125

     JAIME, one of the men from the boat, is half-pushing, half-
     helping a thin and sweaty looking MAN IN A CHECKERED BATHROBE
     towards a cabin at the end of the hall.

     The man in the robe is trembling. He seems stricken with
     fear.

                He's here. I saw him on deck.

     Jaime pushes him inside the cabin and shuts the door.

     A stereo playing softly in the room mixes with the man's
     panicked breathing.

     The man in the robe screams through the closed door, his
     voice echoing off of the metal bulkheads.

                               MAN IN ROBE

     Jaime stands outside the door of the cabin and turns to face
     down the hall. Off in some other part of the boat, he can
     hear McManus wailing like a banshee and the ever-less
     frequent sound of gunshots.

     Keaton has come to the four-foot-high door to the hold. The
     door is open slightly. Keaton finds this strange. He pushes
     the door open and steps inside. The hold is empty.

     He hears a noise behind him. He wheels around to fire. He
     sees McManus in the door. His face is covered with blood.

                I heard somebody screaming his nuts off.
                He said Keyser Soze was on the boat.

                There's no coke.

     McManus looks around the hold as though he'll see four and a
     half tons of dope in some corner where Keaton might have
     missed it.

     The two men look at one another. There is a long, pregnant
     silence.

                                  McMANUS
                Let's get the fuck out of here.

     Keaton and McManus step out of the hold, walking slowly and
     cautiously back from where they came. They hear the sounds of
     footsteps running on the deck above and the occasional
     hollered sentence in Spanish.

     They come to a corner. They can go left or right.

                I can't remember which way.

                Right -

     BOOM - BOOM

     Gunshots fill the hallway from behind them. They do not stop
     to turn around. Keaton goes left, McManus goes right. They
     run in opposite directions with the sound of gunfire right
     behind them.

      The man in the bathrobe sits on the foot of the bed watching
      the door. He hears the sounds of fighting somewhere not too
      far away.

      He crawls over the bed and squeezes between it and the
      bulkhead. Only the top of his head is visible. He starts to
      cry.

      BOOM - BOOM - Two shots just outside in the hall.

      SUDDENLY, the door bursts open. Jaime collapses in a heap on
      the floor, a bullet hole in his eye.

      A FIGURE LOOMS IN THE DOOR

      The man in the bathrobe looks up at the figure. We cannot see
      him.

      The boat is quiet now. Keaton walks out onto the deck.
      He looks out over the pier and sees Verbal standing in the
      middle of the carnage, frozen. Their eyes meet. Keaton waves
      at him as if to shoe him away.

      Verbal hesitates and finally moves towards the van with the
      money. He looks back over his shoulder and sees Keaton.
      Keaton sees him looking and waves again, hurrying him along.  

      Verbal turns away and focuses on the van.

      McManus smiles. He walks slowly across the deck towards
      Keaton. Something is not right about him.

                 Strangest thing...

      down and sees a pipe sticking out of the back of McManus's
      neck.

      closes the back doors of the van.         ,                          

      He looks to his left at the huge loading crane. He glances
      upward along the giant' arm as it swings steadily on.

      Somewhere, off in the distance, the sound of SIRENS can be
      heard.

      Keaton kneels by McManus, trembling with rage. After a moment
      he stands, looking down at McManus' dead body.

      call out a warning to Keaton. He is too late.

      Keaton never sees the crane coming.
      WHAM

      The pellet of barrels hits him square in the back and sends
      him flying into the wheel house of the boat.

      Keaton is still for a moment. Finally, he tries to get up,
      but finds he cannot move his legs.

      Verbal runs down the ramp as fast as he can. He comes to a           
      rope ladder hanging down the side of the boat.                      +

      SUDDENLY, he stops dead in his tracks, looking up at the

>From where he stands, he can just make out the figure of a
TAU, THIN MAN walking along the edge of the deck. He moves
quietly and calmly in the shadows towards the crane, looking
out of place in his expensive suit.

                And that's when you say in your statement
                that you saw...

     Kujan picks up his copy of Verbal's statement to the D.A.

                              KUJAN (CONT'D)
                A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.

                                 VERBAL
                Wait a minute.

                                  KUJAN
                            (Looking at watch)
                I don't have a minute. Are you saying it
                was Keyser Soze? You told the D.A. you
                didn't know who it was.

     Verbal is drowning in Kujan's interrogation. He looks dazed.


                                  VERBAL
                I - there had to be dope there.

                             KUJAN
           Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling.
           You know what I'm getting at.

                            VERBAL
           I don't.

                             KUJAN
           YES YOU DO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT.
           THE TRUTH. TRY TO TELL ME YOU DIDN'T
           KNOW. TRY TO TELL ME YOU SAW SOMEONE KILL
           KEATON .

For the first time, Verbal stands and tries to move away from
Kujan, but Kujan stays in his face, backing him into a
corner. Verbal shields himself with his hands and shuts his

eyes.

                        KUJAN (CONT'D)
           TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW
           EVERYTHING .

                             VERBAL
           I don't know what you're talking about.

                             KUJAN
           YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING
           TIME. GIVE IT TO ME.

Verbal looks into Kujan's eyes with genuine terror. Kujan's
face is red, his body trembles. His locomotive breathing is
the only sound in the room.

                             VERBAL
           I don't understand what you're saying. I
           saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.

                             KUJAN
           Then why didn't you help him?

                             VERBAL
           I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure
           it was Keyser Soze at that point. I                        
           couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to
           him.

                             KUJAN
           But Keaton...

                             VERBAL
           It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean                    
           the Devil himself. How do you shoot the
           Devil in the back?

     Verbal holds up a shaking, twisted hand.
                            VERBAL (CONT'D)
                What if you miss?

140  EXT. BARGE - NIGHT - ONE WEEK PRIOR                               140'

     Verbal is hiding in the tangle of girders and cables on the
     barge.

     VERBAL'S P.O.V.


     Keaton's body is completely obscured.
     The man in a suit strides across the deck over to Keaton,
     stopping to relieve himself on a small fire on the deck.
     He walks up and stands over Keaton. The two men exchange
     words and the man in the suit pulls out a pistol. He points
     it at Keaton.

     RED AND BLUE LIGHTS FLASH BEHIND VERBAL

     Verbal turns. He can just make out police cars coming in the
     distance.

     BANG

     Verbal hears a shot from the deck of the boat. He turns in
     time to see the man in the suit running across the deck
     toward the gangway.

     Verbal can barely see the man from where he is now. The man
     in the suit is covered by shadows and the poor angle from the
     barge. Verbal strains to see but he cannot.

     The man in the suit stops long enough to pull out a lighter.
     He turns and walks back across the deck and out of sight.
     A moment later flames leap up from on the deck.
     The mesh of steel and rubber leaves a dark and open cocoon at
     its base.                                                            

     MOVE INTO THE DARKNESS.                                              

     Sirens are close now. Almost here. The sound of fire raging
     out of control.

     SIRENS BLARING. TIRES SQUEALING. CAR DOORS OPENING. FEET             
     POUNDING THE PAVEMENT.

MOVE FURTHER, SLOWER, INTO THE DARKNESS.
Voices yelling. New light flickering in the surrounding
darkness.

141 INT. RABIN'S OFFICE - DAY - PRESENT                               141
                                  KUJAN
                Arturo Marquez. Ever hear of him?

                                 VERBAL
                Wha- No.

                                  KUJAN
                He was a stool pigeon for the Justice
                Department. He swore out a statement to
                Federal Marshals that he had seen and
                could positively identify one Keyser Soze
                and had intimate knowledge of his
                business, including, but not exclusive
                to, drug trafficking and murder.

                                 VERBAL
                I never heard of him.

                                  KUJAN
                His own people were selling him to a gang
                of Hungarians. Most likely the same
                Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out
                back in Turkey. The money wasn't there
                for dope. The Hungarians were going to
                buy the one guy that could finger Soze
                for them.

                                  VERBAL
                I said I never heard of him.


                                  KUJAN
                But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his
                extradition advisor. She knew who he was
                and what he knew.

                                 VERBAL
                I don't

                                  KUJAN
                There were no drugs on that boat. It was
                a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the
                one man that could finger Keyser Soze so                  
                Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he
                knew he could march into certain death.

                                  VERBAL
                But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent                  t
                us to kill someone?

                             KUJAN
           I'm saying Keaton did.

Verbal cannot grasp this. He squints, trying to understand.

                        KUJAN (CONT'D)
           Verbal, he left you behind for a reason.
           If you all knew Soze could find you
           anywhere, why was he ready to send you
           off with the money when he could have
           used you to take the boat?

                            VERBAL
           He wanted me to live.

                             KUJAN
           Why did he want you to live? A one-time                     
           dirty cop without a loyalty in the world
           finds it in his heart to save a worthless
           rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'

                            VERBAL
           Edie.

                             KUJAN
           I don't buy that reform story for a
           minute. And even if I did, I certainly
           don't believe he would send you to
           protect her. So why?

                            VERBAL
           Because he was my friend.

                             KUJAN
           No, Verbal. You weren't friends. Keaton
           didn't have friends. He saved you because
           he wanted it that way. It was his will.

Verbal grinds to a mental halt, trying to grasp the
implication .

SUDDENLY:

                            VERBAL
           No...

                             KUJAN
           Keaton was Keyser Soze

                             KUJAN
           The kind of guy who could wrangle the
           wills of men like Hockney and McManus.
           The kind of man who could engineer a
           police line-up from all his years of
           contacts in N.Y.P.D.

Verbal stands on wobbly legs, shaking with anger.

                            VERBAL
           NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

A strange look crosses Verbal's face. Shock perhaps, or
revelation.

                        KUJAN (CONT'D)
           They found her yesterday in a hotel in
           Pennsylvania. Shot twice in the head.

It starts to sink in with Verbal. His eyes swell.

                            VERBAL
           Edie...

                             KUJAN
           He used all of you to get him on that
           boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had
           to pull the trigger himself to make sure
           he got his man. The one man that could
           identify him.

                            VERBAL
           This is all bullshit.

                             KUJAN
           He left you to stay behind and tell us he
           was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did
           you? You had to hide when the first
           police cars showed up. You heard the
           shot, just before the fire but you didn't
           see him die.

                             VERBAL
           I knew him. He would never -

                             KUJAN

                         KUJAN (cont'd)
           investigating him for years. He knew we
           were close. You said it yourself. Where
           is the political pressure coming from?
           Why are you being protected? It's Keaton
           making sure you tell us what you're
           supposed to. Immunity is your reward.


                             VERBAL
           BUT WHY ME? WHY NOT HOCKNEY OR FENSTER OR
           McMANUS? I'm a cripple. I'm stupid. Why
           me?

Verbal hears the weight of his words and falls back in his
chair, Kujan looks at him with some pity,; but he is too far

in to stop.

                             KUJAN
           Because you're a cripple, Verbal. Because
           you're stupid. Because you were weaker
           than them. Because you couldn't see far
           enough into him to know the truth.

Verbal is crying now. He shakes his head, eyes closed.

                         KUJAN (CONT'D)
           If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is
           true, then it won't matter. It was his
           idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York,
           wasn't it? Tell me the truth.

           It was all Keaton. We followed him from
           the beginning.

Kujan smiles with triumphant satisfaction.

                         VERBAL (CONT'D)
           I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe
           he's dead. Christ

           Why lie about everything else, then?

           You know what it's like, Agent Kujan, to
           know you'll never be good? Not good like
           you. You got good all fucked around. I
           mean a stand up guy. I grew up knowing I
           was never going to be good at anything
           'cause I was a cripple. Shit, I wasn't

           even a good thief. But I thought the one
           thing I could be good at was a keeping my
           mouth shut - keeping the code. I didn't
           want to tell you for my dignity, that's
           all, and you robbed me, Agent Kujan. You
           robbed me.

Kujan pulls the microphone out from under his tie and puts it +
on the desk. Verbal actually manages to snort a laugh, but
only briefly, overcome by an apparent wave of nausea.

                             KUJAN
           You're not safe on your own.

                            VERBAL
           You think he's..?

                             KUJAN
           Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal.                    
           It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a
           shield. Like you said, a spook story, but
           I know Keaton - and someone out there is
           pulling strings for you. Stay here and
           let us protect you.

                             VERBAL
           I'm not bait. No way. I post today.

                             KUJAN
           You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain
           Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p.,
           unless you turn state's.

                             VERBAL
           I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's
           tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than
           it is to buy a cop.

                             KUJAN
           Where are you going to go, Verbal? You
           gonna run? Turn states evidence. You
           might never see trial. If somebody wants
           to get you, you know They'll get you out
           there.

                             VERBAL
           Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan.
           You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep
           my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11
           keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by
           getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And
           if they kill me, it's

                             VERBAL (cont'd)
                because They'll hear I dropped dime.
                They'll probably hear it from you.

     Verbal stands, mustering his shattered dignity and walks
     towards the door. Rabin opens it for him from outside.

     For once Kujan cannot bring himself to look at Verbal.
     Verbal turns to the door, stopping to look Rabin in the eye.
                            VERBAL (CONT'D)
                Fuckin' cops.

     He steps out of the room and into the hall. Rabin follows
     him.

     Daniel Metzheiser comes out of Arkosh Kovash's room with a
     single sheet of 15x20 inch paper in his hand. He inspects the
     sketch with great interest. He folds the edges of the paper
     back to make it smaller.

143  INT. HOSPITAL RECEPTION ROOM                                       143

     Metzheiser walks behind the reception desk without asking the
     nurse for permission and helps himself to the fax machine.

144  INT. DEPOT - LATER                                                 144

     Verbal is downstairs in the depot of the police station
     picking up his personal belongings.

     A FAT, WHITE-HAIRED COP is checking off the items as he takes
     them out of the tray in which they are kept.

                                    COP
                One watch: gold. One cigarette lighter:
                gold. One wallet: brown. One pack of                       
                cigarettes.

     Verbal collects his personal items and shuffles on his lame
     leg toward the exit.

145 INT. DISPATCHER'S OFFICE                                            145

     Jack Baer stands by a fax machine. A green light comes on
     next to a digital display.

     The display reads: RECEIVING

                                                 BLUE 06/01/94
                                                                     116.

     Kujan stares solemnly at the bulletin board, drinking from
     Rabin's coffee cup. Rabin sits at the desk, sifting through
     the mound of gapers as though considering organizing them
     once and for all.

                                  RAB IN
                You still don't know shit.

                                  KUJAN
                I know what I wanted to know about
                Keaton.

                                  RAB IN
                Which is shit.

                                  KUJAN
                No matter. He'll have to know how close
                we came.

                                  RAB IN
                Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive
                he'll never come up again.

                                  KUJAN
                I'11 find him.

                                  RAB IN
                Waste of time.

                                  KUJAN
                               (To himself)
                A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.

                                  RAB IN
                What?

                                  KUJAN
                Nothing. Something I - forget it.

     Kujan shakes his head. He gestures to the desk.

                             KUJAN (CONT'D)
                Man, you're a fucking slob.

     Rabin regards the mess of his office.

                                  RAB IN
                Yeah. It's got it's own system though. It
                all makes sense when you look at it
                right. You just have to step back from

                it, you know? You should see my garage,
                now that's a horror show...                               

     Kujan is not listening. He has been staring at the bulletin
     board, lost in thought, his unfocused eyes drifting across
     the mess of papers, not looking at anything at all.

147  EXT. STREET                                                         147

     Verbal steps out into the sunlight, putting on a pair of
     cheap sunglasses. He looks up and down the crowded street.
     People on their way to and from lunch, no doubt.

     Cars choke the street in front of the police department as
     they wait for pedestrians to clear the way.

148  INT. DISPATCHER'S OFFICE                                    - 148

     A single sheet of paper comes out of the fax machine, face
     down.

149  INT. RABIN'S OFFICE                                                 149

     Kujan still stares at the bulletin board.

     SUDDENLY, Kujan's face changes. He leans in closer to the
     bulletin board and squints his eyes. His face changes again.

     First a look of puzzlement, then confusion - finally
     realization.

     The coffee cup tumbles from his hand. It hits the floor with
     the SMASH of cheap porcelain. Coffee splatters everywhere.

     Rabin snaps out of his droning and looks up in surprise.

     KUJAN'S P.O.V.

     Kujan is staring not at what is on the bulletin board, but at
     the bulletin board itself.

     His eyes follow the aluminum frame, mounted firmly to the
     wall. One might note it's sturdy construction and it's
     convenient size. Big enough to hold a lifetime of forgotten
     and disregarded notes and facts. Years of police trivia that
     has been hung and forgotten with the intention of finding a
     use for it all someday. One might want such a bulletin board
     for one's self. One would look to see who makes such a               
     bulletin board.
     Kujan's eyes are locked on a metal plate bearing the
     manufacturer's name.

                                               YELLOW 06/11/94
                                                                  118.
      It reads: QUARTET - SKOKIE, ILLINOIS
      Kujan's eyes flash all' over the bulletin board. He finds a
      picture of Rabin in the far corner. He stands beside a scale
      in fishing gear. He proudly holds a hand out to his freshly
      caught marlin. His eyes skim quickly over and stop on an
      eight and a half by eleven inch fax sheet of what must be a
      THREE HUNDRED POUND BLACK MAN. Kujan glazes over his name, it
      is irrelevant. His aliases stand out.

      Slavin, BRICKS, Shank, REDFOOT, Thee, Rooster...

      KUJAN'S EYES WIDEN with sudden realization. He runs for the
      door.

      His foot crushes the broken pieces of Rabin's coffee cup. The
      cup that hovered over Verbal's head for two hours.

      Kujan is in too much of a hurry to notice the two words
      printed on the jagged piece that had been the bottom of the
      cheap mug.

                           KOBAYASHI PORCELAIN.

150   EXT. HALLWAY                                                          150

      Kujan is sprinting wildly down the hall for the stairs.

151   EXT. STREET                                                           151

      Verbal looks behind him and sees ANOTHER COP standing just          
      inside the doorway, lighting a cigarette. The cop notices
      Verbal and watches him in the way that cops look at people
      they cannot place in the category of idiot citizen, or stupid
      criminal.

      Verbal smiles politely, meekly at the cop and walks down the
      steps into the moving throng.

152   INT. DEPOT                                                            152

      Kujan runs up to the desk where Verbal had only moments
      before picked up his belongings. Rabin is right behind him, a
      look of absolute confusion on his face.

                                   KUJAN
                WHERE IS HE? DID YOU SEE HIM?                             t

                                    COP
                The Cripple? He went that way.

     The cog gestures towards the door.

     Kujan runs outside looking around frantically.

153 SCENE DELETED                                                       153'

     Verbal limps his way carefully across the sidewalk, avoiding
     people as best as he can.

     He looks over his shoulder, getting farther away from the
     police station. He can see Rabin and the cop on the steps,
     looking around with strange, lost expressions on their faces.

     He does not notice the car creeping along the curb beside
     him.

155  INT. CAR                                                            155
     DRIVER'S P.O.V.
     The driver's hands tap the wheel patiently. His eyes follow
     Verbal as he fumbles through the crowd.

156  EXT. SIDEWALK                                                       156

     Kujan pushes and shoves, looking this way and that.
157  EXT. STREET                                                         157
     LOW ANGLE on the feet of dozens of people.
     Verbal's feet emerge from the crowd on the far side. They
     hobble along the curb.

     SUDDENLY, the right foot seems to relax a little, the inward
     angle straightens itself out in a few paces and the limp
     ceases as though the leg has grown another inch.

     CRANE UP VERBAL'S BODY

     Verbal's hands are rummaging around in his pockets. The good
     left hand comes up with a pack of cigarettes, the bad right
     hand comes up with a lighter. The right hand flexes with all

                                                       BLUE 06/01/94

           of the grace and coordination of a sculptor's, flicking the
           clasp on the antique lighter with the thumb, striking the
           flint with the index finger. It is a fluid motion, somewhat
           showy.

           Verbal lights a cigarette and smiles to himself. He turns and
           sees the car running alongside.

     158   INT. DISPATCHER'S OFFICE                                           158


           Jack Beer pulls the sheet out of the fax machine and turns it
           over, revealing the composite sketch of Keyser SOZE.                  

           Though crude and distorted, one cannot help but notice how
           much it leaks like VERBAL KINT.

     159   EXT. STREET                                                        159
           The car stops. The driver gets out.
           IT IS KOBAYASHI, or the man we have come to know as such. He
           smiles to Verbal. Verbal steps off of the curb, returning the
           smile as he opens the passenger door and gets in.

           The man called Kobayashi gets in the driver's seat and pulls
           away .
           A moment later, Agent David Kujan of U.S. Customs wanders
           into the frame, looking around much in the way a child would
           when lost at the circus. He takes no notice of the car
           pulling out into traffic, blending in with the rest of the
           cars filled with people on their way back to work.

On VIDEO: JANE BURNHAM lays in bed, wearing a tank top. She's
sixteen, with dark, intense eyes.

                    JANE
          I need a father who's a role model, not
          some horny geek-boy who's gonna spray his
          shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home
          from school.
              (snorts)
          What a lame-o. Somebody really should put
          him out of his misery.

Her mind wanders for a beat.

                    RICKY (O.C.)
          Want me to kill him for you?

Jane looks at us and sits up.

          Yeah, would you?

EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - EARLY MORNING

We're FLYING above suburban America, DESCENDING SLOWLY toward
a tree-lined street.

                    LESTER (V.O.)
          My name is Lester Burnham. This is my
          neighborhood. This is my street. This...
          is my life. I'm forty-two years old. In
          less than a year, I'll be dead.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

We're looking down at a king-sized BED from OVERHEAD:

LESTER BURNHAM lies sleeping amidst expensive bed linens,
face down, wearing PAJAMAS. An irritating ALARM CLOCK RINGS.
Lester gropes blindly to shut it off.

                    LESTER (V.O.)
          Of course, I don't know that yet. He
          rolls over, looks up at us and sighs. He
          doesn't seem too thrilled at the prospect
          of a new day.

                    LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And in a way, I'm dead already.

He sits up and puts on his slippers.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BATH - MOMENTS LATER

Lester thrusts his face directly into a steaming hot shower.

ANGLE from outside the shower: Lester's naked body is
silhouetted through the fogged-up glass door. It becomes
apparent he is masturbating.

                     LESTER (V.O.)
              (amused)
          Look at me, jerking off in the shower.
              (then)
          This will be the high point of my day.
          It's all downhill from here.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

CLOSE on a single, dewy AMERICAN BEAUTY ROSE. A gloved hand
with CLIPPERS appears and SNIPS the flower off.

CAROLYN BURNHAM tends her rose bushes in front of the Burnham
house. A very well-put together woman of forty, she wears
color-coordinated gardening togs and has lots of useful and
expensive tools.

Lester watches her through a WINDOW on the first floor,
peeping out through the drapes.

                    LESTER (V.O.)
          That's my wife Carolyn. See the way the
          handle on those pruning shears matches
          her gardening clogs? That's not an
          accident.

EXT. JIMS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

In the fenced front yard of the house next door, a dog BARKS
repeatedly. A MAN in a conservative suit (JIM #1) chastises
the barking dog.

                    JIM #1
          Hush, Bitsy. You hush. What is wrong?

                    LESTER (V.O.)
          That's our next-door neighbor Jim.

A second MAN in a conservative suit (JIM #2) comes out of the
house.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                              3.
CONTINUED:


                    LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And that's his lover, Jim.

                    JIM #2
              (re: barking dog)
          What in the world is wrong with her? She
          had a walk this morning.

                    JIM #1
          And a jerky treat.

                    JIM #2
          You spoil her.
              (sternly)
          Bitsy. No bark. Come inside. Now.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Lester watches all this from the window.

                    CAROLYN
          Good morning, Jim!

Jim #1 walks toward the fence to greet Carolyn.

                    JIM #1
          Morning, Carolyn.

                    CAROLYN
              (overly friendly)
          I just love your tie! That color!

                    JIM #1
          I just love your roses. How do you get
          them to flourish like this?

                    CAROLYN
          Well, I'll tell you. Egg shells and
          Miracle Grow.

Jim #1 and Carolyn continue to chat, unaware that Lester is
watching them.

                    LESTER (V.O.)
          Man. I get exhausted just watching her.

Lester's POV: We can't hear what Jim and Carolyn are saying,
but she's overly animated, like a TV talk show host.

                    LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          She wasn't always like this. She used to
          be happy. We used to be happy.

                                                              4.



INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

JANE is seated at her desk, working at her computer.

                    LESTER (V.O.)
          My daughter Jane. Only child.

CLOSE on the COMPUTER MONITOR: A PERSONAL BANKING SOFTWARE
window suddenly disappears to reveal another window: a
PLASTIC SURGERY WEBSITE, featuring clinical "before" and
"after" photos of surgically augmented breasts.

                    LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Janie's a pretty typical teenager. Angry,
          insecure, confused. I wish I could tell
          her that's all going to pass...

Outside, a CAR HORN BLARES. Jane stuffs items into her
BACKPACK.

                    LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          But I don't want to lie to her.

We HEAR the CAR HORN again from outside. Jane studies herself
in a mirror, then shifts to get a good profile of her
breasts.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Carolyn stands next to a platinum-colored MERCEDES-BENZ
ML320, reaching in through the drivers' window to blow the
HORN again.

Jane shuffles out of the house, her backpack slung over her
shoulder.

                    CAROLYN
          Jane. Honey. Are you trying to look
          unattractive?

                    JANE
          Yes.

                     CAROLYN
          Well, congratulations. You've succeeded
          admirably.

Jane gets in the car. Lester hurries out the front door,
carrying a BRIEFCASE.




                                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                    CAROLYN (CONT'D)
          Lester, could you make me a little later,
          please? Because I'm not quite late
          enough.

Lester's briefcase suddenly springs open and his papers spill
all over the driveway. He drops to his knees to gather
everything.

                    JANE
          Nice going, Dad.

Lester smiles sheepishly, trying to lighten the moment.

His POV: Carolyn looks down at us, contemptuous but also
bored, as if she gave up expecting anything more long ago.

                    LESTER (V.O.)
          Both my wife and daughter think I'm this
          gigantic loser, and... they're right.

INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - A SHORT TIME LATER

Carolyn is driving; Jane stares out the window. Lester is
asleep in the back seat.

                    LESTER (V.O.)
          I have lost something. I'm not exactly
          sure what it is, but I know I didn't
          always feel this... sedated. But you know
          what? It's never too late to get it back.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Lester sits at his workstation, a BEIGE CUBICLE surrounded by
IDENTICAL BEIGE CUBICLES. He's staring at a computer monitor
and talking on a HEADSET PHONE. The beleaguered expression on
his face is at odds with the light, friendly tone of his
voice.

                    LESTER
          Hello, this is Lester Burnham from Media
          Monthly magazine, I'm calling for Mr.
          Tamblin, please?... Well, we're all under
          a deadline here, uh, but you see, there
          is some basic information about the
          product launch that isn't even covered in
          your press release and I... Yeah. Can I
          ask you a question? Who is Tamblin? Does
          he exist? 'Cause he doesn't ever seem to
          come in... Yeah, okay, I'll leave my
          number...

BRAD, a dapper man in his thirties, approaches and observes
Lester, who is unaware of his presence.

                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          It's 555 0199. Lester Burnham. Thank you!

Lester disconnects the call, obviously irritated.

                    BRAD
          Hey Les. You got a minute?

Lester turns around, smiling perfunctorily

                    LESTER
          For you, Brad? I've got five.

INT. BRAD'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Brad is seated behind his desk in his big corner office.

                    BRAD
          I'm sure you can understand our need to
          cut corners around here.

Lester sits across from him, looking small and isolated.

                    LESTER
          Oh, sure. Times are tight, and you gotta
          free up cash. Gotta spend money to make
          money. Right?

                    BRAD
          Exactly. So...

Brad stands, ready to usher Lester out.

                    LESTER
              (blurts)
          Like the time when Mr. Flournoy used the
          company MasterCard to pay for that
          hooker, and then she used the card
          numbers and stayed at the St. Regis for,
          what was it, like, three months?

                    BRAD
              (startled)
          That's unsubstantiated gossip.

                    LESTER
          That's fifty thousand dollars. That's
          somebody's salary. That's somebody who's
          gonna get fired because Craig has to pay
          women to fuck him!

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             7.
CONTINUED:


                    BRAD
          Jesus. Calm down. Nobody's getting fired
          yet. That's why we're having everyone
          write out a job description, mapping out
          in detail how they contribute. That way,
          management can assess who's valuable and--

                    LESTER
          Who's expendable.

                    BRAD
          It's just business.

                    LESTER
              (angry)
          I've been writing for this magazine for
          fourteen years, Brad. You've been here
          how long, a whole month?

                    BRAD
              (frank)
          I'm one of the good guys, Les. I'm trying
          to level with you. This is your one
          chance to save your job.

Lester stares at him, powerless.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

A MOVING VAN is parked in front of the COLONIAL HOUSE next
door to the Burnhams'. Movers carry furniture toward the
house.

The Mercedes-Benz pulls into the Burnham driveway. Carolyn
drives, Lester is in the passenger seat.

                    CAROLYN
          --there is no decision, you just write
          the damn thing!

                    LESTER
          You don't think it's weird and kinda
          fascist?

                    CAROLYN
          Possibly. But you don't want to be
          unemployed.

                    LESTER
          Oh, well, let's just all sell our souls
          and work for Satan, because it's more
          convenient that way.

CONTINUED:


                    CAROLYN
          Could you be just a little bit more
          dramatic, please, huh?

As they get out of the car, Carolyn scopes out the MOVERS
next door.

                    CAROLYN (CONT'D)
          So we've finally got new neighbors. You
          know, if the Lomans had let me represent
          them, instead of--
              (heavy disdain)
          --"The Real Estate King," that house
          would never have sat on the market for
          six months.

She heads into the house, followed by Lester.

                    LESTER
          Well, they were still mad at you for
          cutting down their sycamore.

                    CAROLYN
          Their sycamore? C'mon! A substantial
          portion of the root structure was on our
          property. You know that. How can you call
          it their sycamore? I wouldn't have the
          heart to just cut down something if it
          wasn't partially mine, which of course it
          was.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

We HEAR EASY-LISTENING MUSIC.

Lester, Carolyn and Jane are eating dinner by CANDLELIGHT.
RED ROSES are bunched in a vase at the center of the table.
Nobody makes eye contact, or even seems aware of anybody
else's presence, until...

                    JANE
          Mom, do we always have to listen to this
          elevator music?

                    CAROLYN
              (considers)
          No. No, we don't. As soon as you've
          prepared a nutritious yet savory meal
          that I'm about to eat, you can listen to
          whatever you like.

A long beat. Lester suddenly turns to Jane.


                                                 (CONTINUED)

                    LESTER
          So Janie, how was school?

                    JANE
              (suspicious)
          It was okay.

                       LESTER
          Just okay?

                    JANE
          No, Dad. It was spec-tac-ular.

A beat.

                    LESTER
          Well, you want to know how things went at
          my job today?

Now she looks at him as if he's lost his mind.

                     LESTER (CONT'D)
          They've hired this efficiency expert,
          this really friendly guy named Brad, how
          perfect is that? And he's basically there
          to make it seem like they're justified in
          firing somebody, because they couldn't
          just come right out and say that, could
          they? No, no, that would be too...
          honest. And so they've asked us--
              (off her look)
          --you couldn't possibly care any less,
          could you?

Carolyn is watching this closely.

                    JANE
              (uncomfortable)
          Well, what do you expect? You can't all
          of a sudden be my best friend, just
          because you had a bad day.

She gets up and heads toward the kitchen.

                    JANE (CONT'D)
          I mean, hello. You've barely even spoken
          to me for months.

She's gone. Lester notices Carolyn looking at him critically.

                    LESTER
          Oh, what, you're mother-of-the-year? You
          treat her like an employee.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                    CAROLYN
              (taken aback)
          What?!

Lester is quiet, staring at his plate.

                    CAROLYN (CONT'D)
              (more authority)
          What?

Lester gets up and starts after Jane, taking his plate with
him.

                    LESTER
          I'm going to get some ice cream.

Carolyn watches him go, irritated.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Jane stands at the sink, rinsing off her plate. Lester
enters.

                    LESTER
          Honey, I'm sorry. I...

Jane turns and stares at him, waiting for him to finish.

                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry I haven't been more available,
          I just... I'm...

He's looking to her for a little help here, but she's too
uncomfortable with this sudden intimacy to give him any.

                    LESTER (CONT'D)
              (finally)
          You know, you don't always have to wait
          for me to come to you...

                    JANE
          Oh, great. So now it's my fault?

                    LESTER
          I didn't say that. It's nobody's fault.
          Janie, what happened? You and I used to
          be pals.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

On VIDEO: We're looking through GREENHOUSE WINDOWS at Lester
and Jane in the kitchen We can't hear what they're saying,
but it's obvious it's not going well.

Jane puts her plate in the dishwasher and leaves. We FOLLOW
HER out the door, then the camera JERKS back to Lester
calling after her.

CLOSE on the face of   RICKY FITTS, illuminated by the screen
of his DIGICAM as he   videotapes. Ricky is eighteen, but his
eyes are much older.   Beneath his Zen-like tranquility lurks
something wounded...   and dangerous.

His POV, on VIDEO: Through the kitchen window, we see Lester
at the sink, rinsing off his plate, muttering to himself. His
head suddenly jerks up and he looks at us, as if he realizes
he's being watched.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Lester's POV: We're looking out through the kitchen window at
the point where Ricky was just standing, but he's no longer
there.

Lester turns off the faucet, dries his hands, then tosses the
towel on the counter on his way out, where it lands next to a
framed PHOTOGRAPH of Lester, Carolyn, and a much-younger
Jane, taken several years earlier at an amusement park.

It's startling how happy they look.

EXT. SALE HOUSE - DAY

CLOSE on a wooden SIGN that reads:

OPEN HOUSE TODAY

BURNHAM & ASSOCIATES REALTY

555-0195 Carolyn Burnham

The sign is planted in front of a RUN-DOWN HOME in a   run-down
neighborhood. The Mercedes is parked in front of the   house.
Carolyn, wearing a smart business suit, is unloading   a box of
cleaning supplies and a BOOMBOX from the back of the   Mercedes
when something across the street catches her eye.

Her POV: In front of a different house with much more curb
appeal is another SIGN, featuring a picture of a handsome
silver-haired MAN. It reads:

Another One SOLD By Buddy Kane

The Real Estate King 555-0100

Carolyn frowns and slams the back of the Mercedes shut.

                                                            12.



INT. SALE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The interior of this house is ugly, oppressive and tasteless.
Carolyn opens the front door, breathes deeply and solemnly
announces:

                    CAROLYN
          I will sell this house today.

She neatly arranges her sales materials on a desk, then
strips down to her undergarments.

                                                       MONTAGE:

We see Carolyn, working with fierce concentration as she:

Cleans glass doors that overlook the patio and pool;

Doggedly scrubs countertops in the kitchen;

Perches on a stepladder to dust a cheap-looking ceiling fan
in the master bedroom;

And vacuums a dirty carpet that will never be clean.

Throughout all this, she keeps repeating to herself:

                    CAROLYN (CONT'D)
          I will sell this house today. I will sell
          this house today. I will sell this house
          today.

INT. SALE HOUSE - BATHROOM - LATER

Carolyn stands in front of the mirror, wearing her suit once
more, applying lipstick. She stares at her reflection
critically.

                    CAROLYN
          I will sell this house today.

She says this as if it were a threat, then notices a smudge
on the mirror and wipes it off.

EXT. SALE HOUSE - FRONT YARD - LATER

The front door opens to reveal Carolyn, greeting us with the
smile she thinks could sell ice to an Eskimo.

                    CAROLYN
          Welcome. I'm Carolyn Burnham!

                                                            13.



INT. SALE HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

Smiling, Carolyn leads a man and woman into the living room.
They're thirtyish, and they've seen a lot of houses today.

                    CAROLYN
          This living room is very dramatic. Wait
          'til you see the native stone fireplace!

The man and woman glance around the dark room, unimpressed.

                    CAROLYN (CONT'D)
          A simple cream would really lighten
          things up. You could even put in a
          skylight.

The woman wrinkles her face, skeptical.

                    CAROLYN (CONT'D)
          Well, why don't we go into the kitchen?

INT. SALE HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

Carolyn enters, followed by a different couple in their
fifties.

                    CAROLYN
          It's a dream come true for any cook. Just
          filled with positive energy. Huh?

INT. SALE HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

Carolyn stands with a different couple: African American,
late twenties. The woman is pregnant.

                    CAROLYN
          ...and you'll be surprised how much a
          ceiling fan can cut down on your energy
          costs.

EXT. SALE HOUSE - BACK YARD - LATER

Carolyn stands by the pool next to two fortyish WOMEN.

                    CAROLYN
          You know, you could have some really fun
          backyard get-togethers out here.

                    WOMAN #1
          The ad said this pool was "lagoon-like."
          There's nothing "lagoon-like" about it.
          Except for maybe the bugs.


                                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                    WOMAN #2
          There's not even any plants out here.

                    CAROLYN
              (re: shrub)
          What do you call this? Is this not a
          plant? If you have a problem with the
          plants, I can always call my landscape
          architect. Solved.

                    WOMAN #2
          I mean, I think "lagoon," I think
          waterfall, I think tropical. This is a
          cement hole.

A beat.

                    CAROLYN
          I have some tiki torches in the garage.

INT. SALE HOUSE - SUN ROOM - LATER

Carolyn enters, alone. She's furious. She locks the sliding
glass door and starts to pull the vertical blinds shut, then
stops. Standing very still, with the blinds casting shadows
across her face, she starts to cry: brief, staccato SOBS that
seemingly escape against her will. Suddenly she SLAPS
herself, hard.

                    CAROLYN
          Shut up. Stop it. You... Weak!

But the tears continue. She SLAPS herself again.

                    CAROLYN (CONT'D)
          Weak. Baby. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!

She SLAPS herself repeatedly until she stops crying. She
stands there, taking deep breaths until she has everything
under control, then pulls the blinds shut, once again all
business. She walks out calmly, leaving us alone in the dark,
empty room.

We HEAR CHEERING and APPLAUSE.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

We're at a high-school BASKETBALL GAME. Teenage boys play a
fast and furious game. One team wearing pale blue and white
uniforms scores a basket. Perky cheerleaders jump up and down
as the CROWD goes wild.



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                            15.
CONTINUED:


Seated in the bleachers, next to the high school BAND, is a
group of about twenty TEENAGE GIRLS, dressed in pale blue and
white uniforms. Among them, Jane sits next to ANGELA HAYES.
At sixteen, Angela is strikingly beautiful; with perfect even
features, blonde hair and a nubile young body, she's the
archetypal American dream girl.

Jane stands and scans the bleachers.

                    ANGELA
          Who are you looking for?

                    JANE
          My parents are coming tonight. They're
          trying to, you know, take an active
          interest in me.

                    ANGELA
          Gross. I hate it when my mom does that.

                    JANE
          They're such assholes. Why can't they
          just have their own lives?

INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - CONTINUOUS

Carolyn drives. Lester is slumped in the passenger seat.

                    LESTER
          What makes you so sure she wants us to be
          there? Did she ask us to come?

                    CAROLYN
          Of course not. She doesn't want us to
          know how important this is to her. But
          she's been practicing her steps for
          weeks.

                    LESTER
          Well, I bet money she's going to resent
          it. And I'm missing the James Bond
          marathon on TNT.

                    CAROLYN
          Lester, this is important. I'm sensing a
          real distance growing between you and
          Jane.

                    LESTER
          Growing? She hates me.

                    CAROLYN
          She's just willful.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             16.
CONTINUED:


                    LESTER
          She hates you too.

Carolyn stares at him, unsure of how to respond.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - LATER

The uniformed girls now stand in formation on the gym floor.

                    ANNOUNCER
              (over P.A.)
          And now, for your half-time
          entertainment, Rockwell High's award-
          winning Dancing Spartanettes!

In the crowded stands, Lester and Carolyn find seats.

                    LESTER
          We can leave right after this, right?

The HIGH SCHOOL BAND plays "ON BROADWAY." On the gym floor,
the girls perform. They're well-rehearsed, but too young to
carry off the ambitious Vegas routine they're attempting.

Lester, watching from the stands, picks out his daughter.

His POV: Jane performs well, concentrating. Dancing awkwardly
next to her is Angela. Suddenly Angela looks right at us and
smiles... a lazy, insolent smile.

Lester leans forward in his seat.

His POV: We're focused on Angela now. Everything starts to
SLOW DOWN... the MUSIC acquires an eerie ECHO...

We ZOOM slowly toward Lester as he watches, transfixed.

His POV: Angela's awkwardness gives way to a fluid grace, and
"ON BROADWAY" FADES into dreamy, hypnotic MUSIC. The light on
Angela grows stronger, and the other girls DISAPPEAR
entirely.

Lester is suddenly alone in the stands, spellbound.

His POV: Angela looks directly at us now, dancing only for
Lester. Her movements take on a blatantly erotic edge as she
starts to unzip her uniform, teasing us with an expression
that's both innocent and knowing, then... she pulls her
uniform OPEN and a profusion of RED ROSE PETALS spill
forth... and we SMASH CUT TO:

                                                            17.



INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS

Angela, fully clothed, is once again surrounded by the other
girls. The HIGH SCHOOL BAND plays its last note, the Dancing
Spartanettes strike their final pose, and the audience
APPLAUDS.

Carolyn claps along with the rest of the audience. Lester
just sits there, unable to take his eyes off Angela.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - LATER

The game is long over. Jane and Angela come out of the gym.

                    JANE
          Oh shit, they're still here.

Her POV: Lester and Carolyn stand at the edge of the parking
lot.

                    LESTER
          Janie!

                    CAROLYN
          Hi! I really enjoyed that!

She crosses reluctantly toward her parents, followed by
Angela.

                    LESTER
          Congratulations, honey, you were great.

                    JANE
          I didn't win anything.

                    LESTER
              (to Angela)
          Hi, I'm Lester. Janie's dad.

                    ANGELA
          Oh. Hi.

An awkward beat.

                    JANE
          This is my friend, Angela Hayes.

                    LESTER
          Okay, good to meet you. You were also
          good tonight. Very... precise.

              (to Angela)
          Nice to meet you, Angela.
              (to Jane)
          Honey, I'm so proud of you. I watched you
          very closely, and you didn't screw up
          once.
              (then, to Lester)
          Okay, we have to go.

She starts toward the parking lot. Lester stays behind.

                    LESTER
          So, what are you girls doing now?

                    JANE
          Dad.

                    ANGELA
          We're going out for pizza.

                    LESTER
          Oh really, do you need a ride? We can
          give you a ride. I have a car. You wanna
          come with us?

                    ANGELA
          Thanks... but I have a car.

                    LESTER
          Oh, you have a car. Oh. That's great!
          That's great, because Janie's thinking
          about getting a car soon too, aren't you,
          honey?

                    JANE
              (you freak)
          Dad. Mom's waiting for you.

                    LESTER
          Well, it was very nice meeting you,
          Angela. Any, uh, friend of Janie's is a
          friend of mine.

Angela smiles, aware of the power she has over him. He is
mesmerized; grateful, even.

                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          Well... I'll be seeing you around then.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)


Lester waves awkwardly as he crosses off.

                    JANE
          Could he be any more pathetic?

                    ANGELA
          I think it's sweet. And I think he and
          your mother have not had sex in a long
          time.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - A FEW HOURS LATER

CLOSE on a solitary red ROSE PETAL as it falls slowly through
the air.

We're looking down on Lester and Carolyn in bed. Even in
sleep, Carolyn looks determined. Lester is awake and stares
up at us.

                    LESTER
          It's the weirdest thing.

The ROSE PETAL drifts into view, landing on his pillow.

                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          I feel like I've been in a coma for about
          twenty years, and I'm just now waking up.

More ROSE PETALS fall onto the bed, and he smiles up at...

His POV: Angela, naked, FLOATS above us as a deluge of ROSE
PETALS falls around her. Her hair fans out around her head
and GLOWS with a subtle, burnished light. She looks down at
us with a smile that is all things...

Lester smiles back and LAUGHS, as ROSE PETALS cover his face.

                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          Spec-tac-ular.

EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - CONTINUOUS

A WHITE BMW 328si CONVERTIBLE is parked on the street outside
the Burnham's house. We HEAR girlish LAUGHTER from inside.

INT. ANGELA'S BMW - CONTINUOUS

Angela is behind the wheel, Jane in the passenger seat.
They're passing a JOINT back and forth.

                    JANE

                    ANGELA
          It's okay. I'm used to guys drooling over
          me. It started when I was about twelve,
          I'd go out to dinner with my parents.
          Every Thursday night, Red Lobster. And
          every guy there would stare at me when I
          walked in. And I knew what they were
          thinking. Just like I knew guys at school
          thought about me when they jerked off.

                     JANE
          Vomit.

                    ANGELA
          No, I liked it. And I still like it. If
          people I don't even know look at me and
          want to fuck me, it means I really have a
          shot at being a model. Which is great,
          because there's nothing worse in life
          than being ordinary.

An awkward beat. Jane stares at the floor.

                    JANE
          I really think it'll happen for you.

                    ANGELA
          Oh, I know. Because everything that was
          meant to happen, does. Eventually.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

On VIDEO: Jane gets out of the car, still LAUGHING, and waves
as Angela pulls away. We ZOOM toward Jane as she walks up the
driveway. She turns suddenly, sensing our presence.

Her POV: We're looking at the COLONIAL HOUSE next door where
the moving van was parked earlier. The front porch is
shrouded in darkness... then a PORCH LIGHT abruptly reveals
Ricky. As usual, he's dressed conservatively. There is a
BEEPER attached to his belt, and his DIGICAM dangles loosely
around his neck.

Irritated, Jane stares at him, hard.

                     JANE
          Asshole.

He looks back at her curiously, then raises his Digicam and
starts to videotape her.

His POV, on VIDEO: Jane, angry and self-conscious, turns and
walks quickly toward her house, flipping us off as she goes.

                                                             21.

Jane enters, closes and locks the door. She quickly TURNS OFF
THE LIGHT that's been left on for her, then peeks through a
window.

Her POV: There's no sign of Ricky.

Jane turns back into the room, her heart racing... and
smiles.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

CLOSE on an ADDRESS BOOK: A man's hand flips to the H page
and then his finger stops at the name Angela Hayes.

Lester, dressed for work, goes through Jane's address book.
We HEAR the SHOWER running in the adjacent bathroom. He grabs
Jane's phone and dials, then stands with the receiver to his
ear, nervous.

                    ANGELA
              (over phone line)
          Hello? Hello?

Lester is frozen, unable to speak. Suddenly, the SHOWER is
turned off in the next room. Lester hangs up and exits
quickly. A moment, then the PHONE RINGS. Jane emerges from
the bathroom, a towel wrapped around her torso, drying her
wet hair. She picks up the PHONE.

                      JANE
          Hello?

INT. HAYES HOUSE - ANGELA'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

                    ANGELA
          Why'd you call me?

                                     INTERCUT WITH JANE IN HER
                                                      BEDROOM:

                      JANE
          I didn't.

                    ANGELA
          Well, my phone just rang and I answered
          it and somebody hung up and then I star
          sixty-nined and it called you back.



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             22.
CONTINUED:


                    JANE
          I was in the shower.

Then Jane notices her address book open to the H page.

                       JANE (CONT'D)
          Oh, gross.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

On VIDEO: We're across from Jane's WINDOW, looking in. Jane
picks up the address book, frowning. She speaks into the
phone, but we can't hear her.

                    WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.)
              (sing song)
          Rick-y! Break-fast!

INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ricky stands at his window, videotaping. He lowers his
Digicam, but his eyes remain locked on Jane across the way.

                    RICKY
          Be right there.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

BARBARA FITTS stands at the stove, flipping bacon strips
mechanically, her eyes focused elsewhere. At least ten years
younger than her husband, she's pretty in a June Cleaver-ish
way. The Colonel sits at a dinette reading The Wall Street
Journal. Ricky enters.

                       RICKY
          Mom.

Startled, Barbara turns to him.

                       BARBARA
          Hello.

As she attempts to serve him bacon:

                    RICKY
          I don't eat bacon, remember?

                    BARBARA
              (unnerved)
          I'm sorry, I must have forgotten.

Ricky serves himself scrambled eggs from another pan, then
joins his father at the table.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                            23.
CONTINUED:


                    RICKY
          What's new in the world, Dad?

                    COLONEL
          This country is going straight to hell.

A DOORBELL rings. The Colonel and Barbara look at each other,
alarmed.

                    COLONEL (CONT'D)
          Are you expecting anyone?

                     BARBARA
          No.
                (thinks)
          No.

The Colonel heads toward the living room, a little puffed up.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

The Colonel opens the front door to reveal the two JIMS.

                     JIM #1
          Hi.

                    JIM #2
          Welcome to the neighborhood.

Jim #1 holds out a basket filled with flowers, vegetables and
a small white cardboard box tied with raffia.

                    JIM #1
          Just a little something from our garden.

                     JIM #2
          Except for the pasta, we got that at
          Fallaci's.

                    JIM #1
          It's unbelievably fresh. You just drop it
          in the water and it's done.

The Colonel stares at them, suspicious.

                    JIM #1 (CONT'D)
              (offers his hand)
          Jim Olmeyer. Two doors down. Welcome to
          the neighborhood.

                    COLONEL
              (shakes)
          Colonel Frank Fitts, U.S. Marine Corps.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             24.
CONTINUED:


                     JIM #1
          Nice to meet you. And this is my
          partner...

                    JIM #2
              (offers his hand)
          Jim Berkley, but people call me J.B.

                    COLONEL
          Let's cut to the chase, okay? What are
          you guys selling?

                    JIM #2
              (after a beat)
          Nothing. We just wanted to say hi to our
          new neighbors--

                    COLONEL
          Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you said you're
          partners. So what's your business?

The Jims look at each other, then back at the Colonel.

                    JIM #1
          Well, he's a tax attorney.

                    JIM #2
          And he's an anesthesiologist.

The Colonel looks at them, confused. Then it dawns on him.

INT. COLONEL'S FORD EXPLORER - LATER

The Colonel drives, staring darkly at the road ahead. In the
passenger seat, Ricky is using a CALCULATOR and jotting
numbers down in a NOTEBOOK.

                     COLONEL
          How come these faggots always have to rub
          it in your face? How can they be so
          shameless?

                    RICKY
          That's the whole thing, Dad. They don't
          feel like it's anything to be ashamed of.

The Colonel looks at Ricky sharply.

                    COLONEL
          Well, it is.

A beat, as Ricky continues his calculations, before he
realizes a response is expected from him. Then:

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             25.
CONTINUED:


                    RICKY
          Yeah, you're right.

The Colonel's eyes flash angrily.

                    COLONEL
          Don't placate me like I'm your mother,
          boy.

Ricky sighs, then looks at his father.

                    RICKY
          Forgive me, sir, for speaking so bluntly,
          but those fags make me want to puke my
          fucking guts out.

The Colonel is taken aback but quickly covers.

                    COLONEL
          Me too, son. Me too.

Case closed, Ricky goes back to his calculations.

CLOSE on the pencil in his hands: He's totaling two columns
of NUMBERS. Under the column "Income" he writes in swift,
bold strokes: $24,950.00.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUS - A SHORT TIME LATER

Jane and Angela are standing with two other TEENAGE GIRLS.

                    ANGELA
          I'm serious, he just pulled down his
          pants and yanked it out. You know, like,
          say hello to Mr. Happy.

TEENAGE GIRL #1

Gross.

                    ANGELA
          It wasn't gross. It was kind of cool.

TEENAGE GIRL #1

So, did you do it with him?

                    ANGELA
          Of course I did. He is a really well-
          known photographer? He shoots for Elle on
          like, a regular basis? It would have been
          so majorly stupid of me to turn him down.

                                                            26.



TEENAGE GIRL #2

You are a total prostitute.

                    ANGELA
          Hey. That's how things really are. You
          just don't know, because you're this
          pampered little suburban chick.

TEENAGE GIRL #2

So are you. You've only been in Seventeen once, and you
looked fat, so stop acting like you're goddamn Christy
Turlington.

The two TEENAGE GIRLS move away from Jane and Angela.

                     ANGELA
              (calling off)
          Cunt!
              (then)
          I am so sick of people taking their
          insecurities out on me.

The Colonel's Ford Explorer pulls up, and Ricky gets out.

                    JANE
          Oh my God. That's the pervert who filmed
          me last night.

                    ANGELA
          Him? Jane. No way. He's a total lunatic.

                    JANE
          You know him?

                    ANGELA
          Yeah. We were on the same lunch shift
          when I was in ninth grade, and he would
          always say the most random, weird things,
          and then one day, he was just like, gone.
          And then, Connie Cardullo told me he his
          parents had to put him in a mental
          institution.

                    JANE
          Why? What did he do?

                    ANGELA
          What do you mean?




                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             27.
CONTINUED:


                    JANE
          Well, they can't put you away just for
          saying weird things.

Angela stares at Jane, then her mouth widens into a smile.

                    ANGELA
          You total slut. You've got a crush on
          him.

                    JANE
          What? Please.

                    ANGELA
          You were defending him! You love him. You
          want to have like, ten thousand of his
          babies.

                     JANE
          Shut up.

Jane suddenly finds Ricky standing in front of her.

                    RICKY
          Hi. My name's Ricky. I just moved next
          door to you.

                    JANE
          I know. I kinda remember this really
          creepy incident when you were filming me
          last night?

                    RICKY
          I didn't mean to scare you. I just think
          you're interesting.

Angela shoots a wide-eyed look at Jane, who ignores it.

                    JANE
          Thanks, but I really don't need to have
          some psycho obsessing about me right now.

                    RICKY
          I'm not obsessing. I'm just curious.

He looks at her intently, his eyes searching hers. Jane is
unnerved and has to look away. Ricky smiles and walks off.

                    ANGELA
          What a freak. And why does he dress like
          a Bible salesman?



                                                   (CONTINUED)

                    JANE
          He's like, so confident. That can't be
          real.

                    ANGELA
          I don't believe him. I mean, he didn't
          even like, look at me once.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - DEN - THAT NIGHT

CLOSE on a TV SCREEN: "Hogan's Heroes" on Nick at Nite.

The Colonel and Barbara are seated on a couch, watching
television. The Colonel is smiling, enjoying the show;
Barbara just stares. The Colonel CHUCKLES at a joke and
startles her.

We HEAR a door opening elsewhere in the house, and Ricky
enters.

                    RICKY
          Hey.

He sits on the couch, next to his father, and watches TV
along with them. The Colonel's smile fades.

                    BARBARA
              (out of the blue)
          I'm sorry, what?

                    RICKY
          Mom. Nobody said anything.

                    BARBARA
          Oh. I'm sorry.

The three of them stare at the TV, like strangers in an
airport.

INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT

We HEAR MUSIC under a room full of people all talking at
once, as Lester and Carolyn enter a hotel ballroom. We FOLLOW
THEM as they pass a SIGN that reads:

GREATER ROCKWELL REALTOR RESOURCES GROUP

                    CAROLYN
          --everyone here is with their spouse or
          their significant other. How would it
          look if I showed up with no one?

                    LESTER
          Well, you always end up ignoring me and
          going off--

Inside the ballroom, well-dressed real estate professionals
stand in clumps, chatting. Catering waiters serve hors
d'eouvres.

                    CAROLYN
          Now listen to me. This is an important
          business function. As you know, my
          business is selling an image. And part of
          my job is to live that image--

                    LESTER
          Just say whatever you want to say and
          spare me the propaganda.

                    CAROLYN
              (spots someone)
          Hi, Shirley!
              (to Lester)
          Listen, just do me a favor. Act happy
          tonight?

                    LESTER
              (grins stupidly)
          I am happy, honey.

Carolyn's jaw tightens, then:

                     CAROLYN
              (spots someone)
          Oh! Buddy!

She drags Lester toward a silver-haired MAN and his much
younger WIFE. We recognize the Man as BUDDY KANE, The Real
Estate King.

                    CAROLYN (CONT'D)
              (shakes Buddy's hand)
          Buddy! Buddy. Hi! Good to see you again.

                    BUDDY
          It's so good to see you too, Catherine.

                     CAROLYN
          Carolyn.

                    BUDDY
          Carolyn! Of course. How are you?

                    CAROLYN
          Very well, thank you.
              (to his wife)
          Hello, Christy.

                     CHRISTY
          Hello.

                    CAROLYN
          My husband, Lester--

                    BUDDY
              (shakes Lester's hand)
          It's a pleasure.

                    LESTER
          Oh, we've met before, actually. This
          thing last year. Or the Christmas thing
          at the Sheraton.

                     BUDDY
          Oh, yes.

                    LESTER
          It's okay. I wouldn't remember me either.

He LAUGHS. A little too loudly. Carolyn quickly joins in.

                    CAROLYN
              (forced gaiety)
          Honey. Don't be weird.

She smiles her most winning smile at him. He knows this
persona well, only it's never pissed him off as much as it
does right now.

                    LESTER
          All right, honey. I won't be weird.
              (his face close to hers)
          I'll be whatever you want me to be.

And he kisses her--a soft, warm kiss that speaks unmistakably
of sex--then turns to the others and grins.

                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          We have a very healthy relationship.

                     BUDDY
          I see.

Carolyn's smile is frozen on her face.

                    LESTER
          Well. I don't know about you, but I need
          a drink.

He crosses off. Carolyn, Buddy and Christy watch him go.

INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Lester stands at the bar. A bartender pours him a drink.

                    LESTER
          Whoa. Put a little more in there, cowboy.

The bartender complies. Lester takes his drink and turns to
face the center of the room.

His POV: Carolyn is talking to Buddy and Christy. She's on:
smiling, animated, LAUGHING too loud at their jokes.

Lester shakes his head. Ricky approaches him, wearing a
waiter's uniform, carrying a tray of empty glasses.

                    RICKY
          Excuse me. Don't you live on Robin Hood
          Trail? The house with the red door?

                    LESTER
              (suspicious)
          Yeah.

                    RICKY
          I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved into the
          house next to you.

                    LESTER
          Oh. Hi, Ricky Fitts. I'm Lester Burnham.

                    RICKY
          Hi, Lester Burnham.

A beat. Lester looks away, scans the crowd, then downs the
rest of his drink in one gulp. Ricky just stands there,
watching him. Finally Lester turns back to Ricky: what does
this kid want?

                    RICKY (CONT'D)
          Do you party?

                       LESTER
          Excuse me?

                    RICKY
          Do you get high?

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           32.
CONTINUED:


Lester's surprised, but instantly intrigued.

INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Carolyn and Buddy are deep in conversation. Christy has
wandered off. Carolyn is nervous; Buddy seems amused.

                    CAROLYN
          You know, I probably wouldn't even tell
          you this if I weren't a little tipsy,
          but... I am in complete awe of you. I
          mean, your firm is, hands down, the Rolls
          Royce of local Real Estate firms, and
          your personal sales record is, is, is
          very intimidating. You know, I'd love to
          sit down with you and just pick your
          brain, if you'd ever be willing. I
          suppose, technically, I'm the
          "competition," but... I mean, hey, I
          don't flatter myself that I'm even in the
          same league as you...

                    BUDDY
          I'd love to.

                    CAROLYN
              (shocked)
          Really?

                    BUDDY
          Absolutely. Call my secretary and have
          her schedule a lunch.

                    CAROLYN
          I'll do that. Thank you.

They look at each other for a beat, then look away. This
situation is loaded and they both know it.

EXT. HOTEL - LATER

Ricky and Lester stand next to a dumpster behind the service
entrance to the hotel, smoking a JOINT.

                    LESTER
          ...did you ever see that movie, where the
          body's walking around holding its own
          head? And then the head goes down on that
          babe?

                    RICKY
          Re-Animator.


                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             33.
CONTINUED:


Suddenly, the service entrance opens, and a large CATERING
BOSS in a cheap suit peers out at them. Ricky hides the
joint.

                    CATERING BOSS
              (to Ricky)
          Look. I'm not paying you to...
              (eyes Lester, suspiciously)
          ...do whatever it is you're doing out
          here.

                    RICKY
          Fine. So don't pay me.

                       CATERING BOSS
          Excuse me?

                    RICKY
          I quit. So you don't have to pay me. Now,
          leave me alone.

                       CATERING BOSS
          Asshole.

He goes back inside. Lester looks at Ricky, who shrugs.

                     LESTER
          I think you just became my personal hero.
              (then)
          Doesn't that make you nervous, just
          quitting your job like that? Well, I
          guess when you're all of, what? Sixteen?

                     RICKY
          Eighteen.
              (then)
          I just do these gigs as a cover. I have
          other sources of income. But my dad
          interferes less in my life when I pretend
          to be an upstanding young citizen with a
          respectable job.

                       CAROLYN (O.C.)
          Lester?

Carolyn is standing in the open service entrance. Lester
quickly hides the joint behind his back.

                    CAROLYN (CONT'D)
          What are you doing?




                                                  (CONTINUED)

                    LESTER
          Honey, this is...
              (laughs)
          Ricky Fitts. This is Ricky Fitts.

                    RICKY
          I'm Ricky Fitts, I just moved in the
          house next to you. I go to school with
          your daughter.

                    LESTER
          With Jane? Really?

                    RICKY
          Yeah. Jane.

                      CAROLYN
          Hi.
              (then, to Lester)
          I'm ready to go. I'll meet you out front.

And she goes back inside.

                    LESTER
          Uh-oh. I'm in trouble. Nice meeting you,
          Ricky Fitts. Thanks for the, uh, thing.

                      RICKY
          Any time.

Lester goes inside.

                    RICKY (CONT'D)
              (calls after him)
          Lester. If you want any more, you know
          where I live.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - LATER

Jane and Angela are watching MTV. We HEAR the back door open.

                    JANE
          Oh, shit. They're home. Quick, let's go
          up to my room.

Jane switches off the TV.

                    ANGELA
          I should say hi to your dad.
              (off Jane's look)
          I don't want to be rude.

She starts toward the kitchen. Jane doesn't like this.

                                                             35.



INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Lester enters and opens the refrigerator.

                       ANGELA (O.C.)
          Nice suit.

He turns, and is instantly transfixed by:

His POV: Angela leans against the counter, twirling her hair.

                    ANGELA (CONT'D)
          You're looking good, Mr. Burnham.

She starts toward him.

                    ANGELA (CONT'D)
          Last time I saw you, you looked kind of
          wound up.
              (spots something)
          Ooh, is that root beer?

She reaches inside the refrigerator to grab a bottle. As she
does, she moves to place her other hand casually on Lester's
shoulder. He sees it coming. Everything SLOWS DOWN, and all
sound FADES...

EXTREME CLOSE UP on her hand as it briefly touches his
shoulder in SLOW MOTION. We HEAR only the amplified BRUSH of
her fingers against the fabric of his suit, and its
unnatural, hollow ECHO...

BACK IN REAL TIME: She grabs the root beer and smiles at him.

CLOSE on Lester: his eyes narrow slightly, then:

He cups her face in his hands and kisses her. She seems
shocked, but doesn't resist as he pulls her toward him    with
surprising strength. He breaks the kiss, looking at her    in
awe, then he reaches up and touches his lips. His eyes    widen
as he pulls a ROSE PETAL from his mouth right before we    SMASH
CUT TO:

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Angela is back against the counter, drinking the root beer.
Lester stands by the refrigerator, gazing at her, still lost
in fantasy.

                    ANGELA
          I love root beer, don't you?



                                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


Jane watches from the doorway to the family room, feeling
incredibly awkward in her own home. Carolyn enters from the
dining room. Lester snaps out of it and grabs a root beer
from the refrigerator.

                    JANE
          Mom, you remember Angela.

                    CAROLYN
              (her sales smile)
          Yes, of course!

                    JANE
          I forgot to tell you, she's spending the
          night. Is that okay?

                     LESTER
          Sure!

He takes a sip of his root beer, but it goes down the wrong
way and he starts COUGHING violently.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Angela lays on the bed, in bra and panties, reading a
magazine. Jane, in an oversized T shirt, plays a video game
on her computer.

                    JANE
          I'm sorry about my dad.

                    ANGELA
          Don't be. I think it's funny.

                    JANE
          Yeah, to you, he's just another guy who
          wants to jump your bones. But to me...
          he's just too embarrassing to live.

                    ANGELA
          Your mom's the one who's embarrassing.
          What a phony.

Jane glances at Angela, irritated.

                    ANGELA (CONT'D)
          Your dad's actually kind of cute.

                     JANE
          Shut up.

                                                             37.



INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Lester, still in his suit, stands outside Jane's room, his
ear up against the door. He can't believe what he's hearing.

                    ANGELA (O.C.)
          He is. If he just worked out a little,
          he'd be hot.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                     JANE
          Shut up.

                    ANGELA
          Oh, come on. Like you've never sneaked a
          peek at him in his underwear? I bet he's
          got a big dick.

                    JANE
          You are so grossing me out right now.

                    ANGELA
              (really enjoying this)
          If he built up his chest and arms, I
          would totally fuck him.

Jane covers her ears and starts SINGING to drown her out.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Lester, still listening, looks like he's about to implode.

                     ANGELA (O.C.)
              (laughs)
          I would! I would suck your dad's big fat
          dick, and then I would fuck him 'til his
          eyes rolled back in his head!
              (then)
          What was that noise? Jane.

Jane's SINGING stops.

                    ANGELA (O.C.) (CONT'D)
          I swear I heard something.

Panicked, Lester scurries down the hall.

                    JANE
          Yeah, it was the sound of you being a

CONTINUED:


                    ANGELA
          I'm serious.

We HEAR the sharp TAP of a penny being thrown against glass.

                    ANGELA (CONT'D)
          See?

Angela crosses to the window and looks out.

                    ANGELA (CONT'D)
              (spots something)
          Oh my God. Jane.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

We see Angela standing at the window in her underwear,
looking down at us. Jane joins her and is immediately
unnerved by:

Their POV: In the Burnham's DRIVEWAY, the word "JANE" is
spelled out in FIRE.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

                    ANGELA
          It's that psycho next door. Jane, what if
          he worships you? What if he's got a
          shrine with pictures of you surrounded by
          dead people's heads and stuff?

                    JANE
          Shit. I bet he's filming us right now.

                    ANGELA
              (intrigued)
          Really?

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

On VIDEO: We're across from Jane's window, looking in. Jane
tries to shut the drapes, but Angela won't let her.
Irritated, Jane retreats into the room. We ZOOM toward her,
even as Angela poses in the window; we're clearly not
interested in Angela. The ZOOM continues, searching for Jane,
who has disappeared. Finally, we settle on the small make-up
MIRROR where we see a REFLECTION of Jane, back at her
computer. She's smiling. Then suddenly the DRAPES CLOSE and
she's gone.

                                                             39.



INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ricky sits in darkness with his DIGICAM, videotaping. He
lowers the camera and smiles... then something below catches
his attention. He leans out the window to get a better look
at:

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

Ricky's POV: Through a WINDOW on the side of the Burnham's
GARAGE DOOR, we see Lester, still in his suit, digging
through shelves against the back wall.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

Lester digs through stuff stored on the shelves, searching
for something as if his very life depended on it.

                    LESTER
          Shit. Shit!

He yanks aside COLLEGE YEARBOOKS, a racquetball RACQUET,
boxes of old HOT ROD MAGAZINES, an unopened remote-controlled
MODEL JEEP KIT, stacks of old vinyl LPs... finally his face
lights up when he finds:

A pair of DUMBBELLS obviously unused for many years.

Lester rips off his jacket and tie and unbuttons his shirt.
He glances around, finding his REFLECTION in the WINDOW as he
pulls off his shirt, then the T-shirt underneath. He eyes
himself critically: Angela was right, he's not in bad shape.
Just a few extra pounds around his middle that wouldn't be
hard to shed. He kicks off his shoes and begins to step out
of his pants.

Ricky holds his Digicam up and starts to videotape.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

Ricky's POV, on VIDEO: Through a WINDOW on the side of the
Burnham's garage, we see Lester step out of his pants and
briefs. Then, naked except for his black socks, he grabs the
dumbbells and starts lifting them, watching his reflection in
the window as he does.

          Welcome to America's Weirdest Home
          Videos.

Suddenly we HEAR someone trying to open a locked door.

                    COLONEL (O.C.)
          Ricky!

Moving swiftly, Ricky pulls the drapes shut and switches on a
light. His room is a haven of high-tech. A state-of-the-art
multimedia COMPUTER crowds his desk, and high-end STEREO and
VIDEO EQUIPMENT line the shelves, as well as HUNDREDS OF CDs.
There is easily twenty thousand dollars worth of equipment in
this room.

                    RICKY
          Coming, Dad.

                    COLONEL (O.C.)
          You know I don't like locked doors in my
          house, boy.

Ricky opens the door. The Colonel stands outside, eyeing him.

                    RICKY
          I'm sorry, I must have locked it by
          accident. So what's up?

The Colonel holds out a small PLASTIC CUP WITH A CAP.

                    COLONEL
          I need a urine sample.

                    RICKY
          Wow. It's been six months already. Can I
          give it to you in the morning? I just
          took a whiz.

                    COLONEL
          Yeah, I suppose.
              (an awkward beat)
          Well. Good night, son.

He disappears down the hall. Ricky smiles, shuts and locks
his door. He puts the plastic cup on the shelf, then crosses
to a MINI REFRIGERATOR in the corner of his room and takes
out a cup-sized TUPPERWARE CONTAINER from the freezer,
already filled with urine, albeit frozen, and places it on a
saucer to thaw overnight.

                                                             41.



INT BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Carolyn lies sleeping. Lester is awake, staring at the
ceiling. After a moment, he gets up, taking care not to
disturb Carolyn, and walks toward the bathroom.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BATH - CONTINUOUS

Lester enters and switches on the LIGHT. The room is filled
with STEAM. Lester looks around, confused, then focuses on:

His POV: Across from us, in a PEDESTAL BATHTUB, is Angela.
She smiles and beckons us, and we MOVE CLOSER. ROSE PETALS
float on the surface of the water, obscuring her naked body.

                    ANGELA
          I've been waiting for you.

Lester kneels by the bathtub like a man in church.

                    ANGELA (CONT'D)
          You've been working out, haven't you? I
          can tell.

She arches her back and looks up at him provocatively.

                    ANGELA (CONT'D)
          I was hoping you'd give me a bath... I'm
          very, very dirty.

Lester gives her a hard look, then slowly slips his hand into
the water between her legs. Her eyes widen and she throws her
head back... and we SMASH CUT TO:

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE on Carolyn, her eyes wide, listening to the rhythmic
BRUSH of Lester's hand as he masturbates under the covers.

She flips over and faces him.

                    CAROLYN
          What are you doing?

A beat.

                     LESTER
          Nothing.

Carolyn switches on the bedside LIGHT.

                    CAROLYN
          You were masturbating.

          I was not.

                    CAROLYN
          Yes, you were.

He turns to her, trying to look innocent, then gives up.

                    LESTER
          All right, so shoot me. I was whacking
          off.

Carolyn gets out of bed, repelled. Lester LAUGHS.

                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          That's right. I was choking the bishop.
          Shaving the carrot. Saying hi to my
          monster.

                    CAROLYN
          That's disgusting.

                    LESTER
          Well, excuse me, but I still have blood
          pumping through my veins!

                       CAROLYN
          So do I!

                    LESTER
          Really? I'm the only one who seems to be
          doing anything about it.

                    CAROLYN
          Lester. I refuse to live like this. This
          is not a marriage.

                    LESTER
          This hasn't been a marriage for years.
          But you were happy as long as I kept my
          mouth shut. Well, guess what? I've
          changed. And the new me whacks off when
          he feels horny, because you're obviously
          not going to help me out in that
          department.

                    CAROLYN
          Oh. I see. You think you're the only one
          who's sexually frustrated?

                    LESTER
          I'm not? Well then, come on, baby! I'm
          ready.

          Do not mess with me, mister, or I will
          divorce you so fast it'll make your head
          spin!

                    LESTER
          On what grounds? I'm not a drunk, I don't
          fuck other women, I don't mistreat you,
          I've never hit you, or even tried to
          touch you since you made it so abundantly
          clear just how unnecessary you consider
          me to be. But. I did support you while
          you got your license. And some people
          might think that entitles me to half of
          what's yours.

She sinks into a chair, stunned. It's clear he knows where
she's most vulnerable. He sees this, and likes it; it feels
good to win for a change. He curls up under the covers
contentedly.

                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          Turn out the light when you come to bed,
          okay?

CLOSE on Lester, smiling.

EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - EARLY MORNING

We're FLYING high above the neighborhood. Below us we see the
two Jims, jogging. We APPROACH them steadily.

                    LESTER
          It's a great thing when you realize you
          still have the ability to surprise
          yourself. Makes you wonder what else you
          can do that you've forgotten about.

EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - CONTINUOUS

We're now at street level, FOLLOWING the two Jims.

                    LESTER
          Hey! You guys!

Still running, the Jims turn back in perfect unison, as
Lester runs INTO FRAME, wearing a baggy sweatshirt and a pair
of faded old sweatpants. The Jims slow down until he catches
up, then the three men run together in the early morning
light.

              (panting)
          Well, I just started.

                    JIM #1
          Good for you.

                    LESTER
          I figured you guys might be able to give
          me some pointers. I need to shape up.
          Fast.

                    JIM #1
          Well, are you just looking to lose
          weight, or do you want have increased
          strength and flexibility as well?

                    LESTER
          I want to look good naked.

EXT. FITTS HOUSE - A SHORT TIME LATER

The Colonel is washing his Ford Explorer, squatting to scrub
the bumper, when something Catches his eye:

His POV: Lester and the Jims jog down the street.

The Colonel stands, scowling, as Ricky comes out of the
house, holding the URINE SAMPLE in front of him.

                    COLONEL
          What is this, the fucking gay pride
          parade?

Lester breaks off from the two Jims and jogs up to Ricky and
the Colonel, out of breath. He grabs hold of his knees and
bends over, panting.

                    LESTER
          Hey! Yo! Ricky!
              (re: the Jims)
          My entire life is passing before my eyes,
          and those two have barely broken a sweat.

He LAUGHS, and extends his hand to the Colonel.

                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          Sorry, hi. Lester Burnham, I live next
          door. We haven't met.

          COLONEL Frank Fitts, U.S. Marine Corps.

                    LESTER
          Whoa. Welcome to the neighborhood, sir.

He salutes the Colonel good-naturedly, grinning. The Colonel
doesn't think it's funny. An awkward beat.

                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          So, Ricky, uh, I was thinking about the,
          uh... I was gonna... the movie we talked
          about...

                    RICKY
              (quickly)
          Re-Animator.

                    LESTER
          Yeah!

                    RICKY
          You want to borrow it?
              (before Lester can answer)
          Okay, it's up in my room. Come on.

He heads into the house. Lester waves at the Colonel, then
follows him. The Colonel watches them go, his eyes dark.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Ricky enters, followed by Lester.

                    RICKY
          Can you hold this for a sec?

                    LESTER
          Sure.

He gives the URINE SPECIMEN to Lester, then locks the door.

                    RICKY
          I don't think my dad would try to come in
          when somebody else is here, but you never
          know.

Ricky crosses to a bureau and opens a DRAWER. He takes
clothing out and piles it on his bed.

                    LESTER
              (re: urine sample)
          What is this?

          Urine. I have to take a drug test every
          six months to make sure I'm clean.

                    LESTER
          Are you kidding? You just smoked with me
          last night.

                    RICKY
          It's not mine. One of my clients is a
          nurse in a pediatrician's office. I cut
          her a deal, she keeps me in clean piss.

Lester picks up a CD case from a shelf and examines it.

                    LESTER
          You like Pink Floyd?

                    RICKY
          I like a lot of music.

                    LESTER
          Man, I haven't listened to this album in
          years.

He shakes his head, then puts the CD case down. Ricky, having
emptied the drawer, now removes a FALSE BOTTOM, revealing
rows of MARIJUANA, tightly packed in ZIP-LOC BAGS.

                    RICKY
          How much do you want?

                    LESTER
          I don't know, it's been a while. How much
          is an ounce?

                    RICKY
              (indicates bag)
          Well, this is totally decent, and it's
          three hundred.

                    LESTER
          Wow.

                    RICKY
              (indicates another bag)
          But this shit is top of the line. It's
          called G-13. Genetically engineered by
          the U.S. Government. Extremely potent.
          But a completely mellow high, no
          paranoia.

          How much?

                       RICKY
          Two grand.

          Jesus. Things have changed since 1973.

                    RICKY
          You don't have to pay now. I know you're
          good for it.

A beat.

              (hands him a bag)
          There's a card in there with my beeper
          number, call me anytime day or night. And
          I only accept cash.

                    LESTER
              (looks around room)
          Well, now I know how you can afford all
          this equipment. When I was your age, I
          flipped burgers all summer just to be
          able to buy an eight track.

          That sucks.

                    LESTER
          No actually, it was great. All I did was
          party and get laid.
              (smiles)
          I had my whole life ahead of me...

                    RICKY
          My dad thinks I pay for all this with
          catering jobs.
              (off Lester's look)
          Never underestimate the power of denial.

Lester smiles. This kid's cool.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - LATER

Carolyn, carrying a basket of fresh cut ROSES, passes by the
GARAGE WINDOW. From inside the garage, we HEAR ROCK MUSIC.

Carolyn stops and SNIFFS the air, frowning. She peers through
the window.

Her POV: Lester, in a T-shirt and gym shorts, lies on a new
WEIGHT BENCH, doing bench presses with shiny new BARBELLS.

INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

ROCK MUSIC blasts from a new BOOMBOX on the floor.

The garage is in the process of becoming Lester's sanctuary.
An ugly but comfortable 70's BOWL CHAIR has been pulled out
and cleaned off, his old hot rod magazines strewn across it,
and the remote-controlled MODEL JEEP KIT is spread across a
card table. The SHELVES that Lester tore through earlier have
been dismantled, leaving a blank wall on which now hangs a
DART BOARD.

Lester finishes his last rep, straining, then puts the
weights in their rack and sits up. As he takes a drag off a
joint, the GARAGE DOOR suddenly starts to open. Lester looks
up, squinting at:

His POV: The door raises to reveal Carolyn, silhouetted
against the bright sunlight outside, pointing a REMOTE at us.

                    LESTER
          Uh-oh, mom's mad.

                    CAROLYN
          What the hell do you think you're doing?

                    LESTER
          Bench presses. I'm going to wail on my
          pecs, and then I'm going to do my back.

                    CAROLYN
          I see you're smoking pot now. I'm so
          glad. I think using illegal psychotropic
          substances is a very positive example to
          set for our daughter.

                    LESTER
          You're one to talk, you bloodless, money-
          grubbing freak.

          Do you mind? I'm trying to work out here.
              (then, suggestively)
          Unless you want to spot me.

                    CAROLYN
          You will not get away with this. You can
          be sure of that!

And she's gone. Lester leans back on the bench and grabs the
weights.

                    LESTER
              (as he lifts)
          That's. What. You. Think.

INT. BRAD'S OFFICE - DAY

Brad is seated behind his desk, reading a document. Lester
sits across from him, smiling.

                    BRAD
              (reads)
          "...my job consists of basically masking
          my contempt for the assholes in charge,
          and, at least once a day, retiring to the
          men's room so I can jerk off, while I
          fantasize about a life that doesn't so
          closely resemble hell."
              (looks up at Lester)
          Well, you obviously have no interest in
          saving yourself.

                    LESTER
              (laughs)
          Brad, for fourteen years I've been a
          whore for the advertising industry. The
          only way I could save myself now is if I
          start firebombing.

                    BRAD
          Whatever. Management wants you gone by
          the end of the day.

                    LESTER
          Well, just what sort of severance package

          And I'm sure that some of our advertisers
          and rival publications might like to know
          about it as well. Not to mention, Craig's
          wife.

Brad sighs.

                    BRAD
          What do you want?

                    LESTER
          One year's salary, with benefits.

                    BRAD
          That's not going to happen.

                    LESTER
          Well, what do you say I throw in a little
          sexual harassment charge to boot?

Brad LAUGHS.

                    BRAD
          Against who?

                    LESTER
          Against you.

Brad stops laughing.

                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          Can you prove you didn't offer to save my
          job if I'd let you blow me?

Brad leans back in his chair, studying Lester.

                    BRAD
          Man. You are one twisted fuck.

                    LESTER
              (standing)
          Nope. I'm just an ordinary guy with
          nothing to lose.

                                                          51.



INT. OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

Exhilarated, Lester walks down a corridor, his belongings in
a box on his shoulder. He's happier than he's been in years.

                     LESTER
          Yeah!

INT. RESTAURANT - LATER THAT DAY

Carolyn sits at a table, lost in thought. There are two menus
on the table. After a moment, Buddy Kane, the Real Estate
King, joins her. Carolyn immediately becomes warm and
gracious.

                     BUDDY
          Carolyn.

                     CAROLYN
          Buddy.

Carolyn smiles, genuinely touched that he remembers her name.

                    BUDDY
          I'm so sorry I kept you waiting. Christy
          left for New York this morning, and...
          let's just say things were very hectic
          around the house.

                    CAROLYN
          What's she doing in New York?

                    BUDDY
          She's moving there.
              (off Carolyn's look)
          Yes. We are splitting up.

                    CAROLYN
          Buddy. I'm so sorry.

                    BUDDY
              (bitterly)
          Yes, according to her, I'm too focused on
          my career. As if being driven to succeed
          is some sort of character flaw. Well, she
          certainly knew how to take advantage of
          the lifestyle my success afforded her.
          Oh. Wow.
              (then, laughing)
          Ah, it's for the best.




                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                            52.
CONTINUED:


                    CAROLYN
          When I saw you two at the party the other
          night, you seemed perfectly happy.

                    BUDDY
          Well, call me crazy, but it is my
          philosophy that in order to be
          successful, one must project an image of
          success, at all times.

He smiles, then opens his menu. Carolyn picks hers up
mechanically, but continues to stare at him, enraptured, like
a fervent Christian who's just come face to face with Jesus.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUS - LATER THAT DAY

Ricky stands with his DIGICAM, videotaping something on the
ground at his feet.

On VIDEO: A DEAD BIRD lays on the ground, decomposing.

                    ANGELA (O.C.)
          What are you doing?

On VIDEO: The camera JERKS up to discover Jane and Angela
staring at us.

                    RICKY (O.C.)
          I was filming this dead bird.

                      ANGELA
          Why?

                    RICKY (O.C.)
          Because it's beautiful.

On VIDEO: Angela looks at Jane, trying not to laugh.

                    ANGELA
          I think maybe you forgot your medication
          today, mental boy.

On VIDEO: She falls out of frame as we ZOOM toward Jane.

                      RICKY (O.C.)
          Hi, Jane.

                    JANE
              (uncomfortable)
          Look. I want you to stop filming me.

Ricky lowers the Digicam.


                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                            53.
CONTINUED:


                    RICKY
          Okay.

He looks at her, curious, his eyes searching hers. She
doesn't look away.

                    ANGELA
          Well, whatever.
              (to Jane)
          This is boring. Let's go.

                    JANE
              (to Ricky)
          Do you need a ride?

                    ANGELA
              (to Jane)
          Are you crazy? I don't want to end up
          hacked to pieces in a dumpster somewhere.

                    RICKY
          It's okay. I'll walk. But thanks.

                    ANGELA
          Yeah, see? He doesn't want to go anyway.
          C'mon, let's go.

Angela starts off, but Jane doesn't follow. Ricky smiles at
her. She almost smiles back, then:

                    JANE
              (calls off to Angela)
          I think I'm going to walk, too.

Angela stops and stares at her.

                    ANGELA
          What? Jane, that's like, almost a mile.

EXT. TOP HAT MOTEL - LATER THAT DAY

Carolyn's Mercedes is parked next to a JAGUAR CONVERTIBLE
with a VANITY LICENSE PLATE that reads "R E KING."

INT. TOP HAT MOTEL - CONTINUOUS

Carolyn and Buddy are in the middle of sex.

                    CAROLYN
          Yes! Oh, God! I love it!

                    BUDDY
          You like getting nailed by the king?

EXT. STREET - LATER THAT DAY

Lester's TOYOTA CAMRY cruises through the streets. We hear
Lester SINGING along to "AMERICAN WOMAN" on the STEREO.

INT. TOYOTA CAMRY - CONTINUOUS

Lester is driving, smoking a joint.

                    LESTER
          AMERICAN WOMAN, STAY AWAY FROM ME...
          AMERICAN WOMAN, MAMA LET ME BE... DON'T
          COME A HANGIN' AROUND MY DOOR... I DON'T
          WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE NO MORE...

EXT. MR. SMILEY'S - CONTINUOUS

Lester continues singing along to "AMERICAN WOMAN," as the
Camry pulls into the parking lot of a FAST FOOD RESTAURANT.

Lester pulls up to the drive-thru speaker box.

                    DRIVE-THRU GIRL (O.C.)
              (over speaker box)
          Smile you're at Mr. Smiley's.

Lester turns down the volume on the stereo.

                    LESTER
          What?

                    DRIVE-THRU GIRL (O.C.)
          Would you like to try our new bacon and
          egg fajita just a dollar twenty-nine for
          a limited time only.

                    LESTER
          Uh... no. But thank you.
              (reading menu)
          I'll have a Big Barn Burger, Smiley
          fries, and an orange soda.

                    DRIVE-THRU GIRL (O.C.)
          Please drive up to the window, thank you.

He pulls the car around to the WINDOW, where a teenage GIRL
wearing a headset is waiting.




                                                 (CONTINUED)

          Smile, you're at Mr. Smiley's, that'll be
          four eighty-nine, please.

Lester pays her. As she hands him his food, he notices a SIGN
in the corner of the window that reads:

NOW TAKING APPLICATIONS

                    COUNTER GIRL
          Would you like some Smiley Sauce?

                    LESTER
          No. No, actually... I'd like to fill out
          an application.

She stares at him, confused by his age and attire.

                    COUNTER GIRL
          There's not jobs for manager, it's just
          for counter.

                    LESTER
          Good. I'm looking for the least possible
          amount of responsibility.

INT. MR. SMILEY'S - A SHORT TIME LATER

Lester sits at a booth with the MANAGER, a greasy kid wearing
a white short sleeve shirt and a tie covered with the Mr.
Smiley's logo. He looks over Lester's application, baffled.

                    MANAGER
          I don't think you'd fit in here.

                    LESTER
          I have fast food experience.

                    MANAGER
          Yeah, like twenty years ago.

                    LESTER
          Well, I'm sure there have been amazing
          technological advances in the industry,
          but surely you have some sort of training
          process. It seems unfair to presume I
          won't be able to learn.

The Manager sighs and runs a hand through his greasy hair,
wondering what he could possibly have done to deserve this.

                                                           56.



INT. TOP HAT MOTEL - LATER THAT DAY

Carolyn and Buddy are in bed, post-sex.

                    CAROLYN
          That was exactly what I needed. The royal
          treatment, so to speak.

They laugh.

                    CAROLYN (CONT'D)
          I was so stressed out.

                    BUDDY
          Know what I do when I feel like that?

                    CAROLYN
          What?

                    BUDDY
          I fire a gun.

Carolyn sits up, eager to learn from the master.

                    CAROLYN
              (intrigued)
          Really.

                    BUDDY
          Oh yeah, I go to this little firing range
          downtown, and I just pop off a few
          rounds.

                    CAROLYN
              (embarrassed)
          I've never fired a gun before.

                    BUDDY
          Oh, you've gotta try it. Nothing makes
          you feel more powerful.
              (smiles seductively)
          Well, almost nothing.

Carolyn is quick to pick up her cue and kisses him, ready for
another round.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATER THAT DAY

Ricky and Jane walk along without speaking. He seems
comfortable with the silence; she doesn't. After a beat:

                    JANE
          So how do you like your new house?

                       RICKY
          I like it.

A beat.

                    JANE
          The people who used to live there fed
          these stray cats, so they were always
          around, and it drove my mother nuts. And
          then she cut down their tree.

An automobile FUNERAL PROCESSION appears and begins to pass
them slowly.

                    RICKY
          Have you ever known anybody who died?

                       JANE
          No.
              (a beat)
          Have you?

                    RICKY
          No, but I did see this homeless woman who
          froze to death once. Just laying there on
          the sidewalk. She looked really sad.

They watch the FUNERAL CARS pass.

                    RICKY (CONT'D)
          I got that homeless woman on video.

                    JANE
          Why would you film that?

                    RICKY
          Because it was amazing.

                    JANE
          What was amazing about it?

A beat.

                    RICKY
          When you see something like that, it's
          like God is looking right at you, just
          for a second. And if you're careful, you
          can look right back.

                    JANE
          And what do you see?

INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Barbara Fitts sits at the kitchen table, staring off into
space as if hypnotized. Behind her, Ricky enters, followed by
Jane.

                     RICKY
          Mom, I want you to meet somebody.
               (no response)
          Mom.

Barbara's eyes flutter and she turns to him slowly.

                       BARBARA
                 (pleasant)
          Yes?

                    RICKY
          I want you to meet somebody. This is
          Jane.

          Hi.

                    BARBARA
          Oh, my. I apologize for the way things
          look around here.

Jane glances around. The room is spotless.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - THE COLONEL'S STUDY - MOMENTS LATER

We HEAR KEYS TURNING in the lock, then the door opens and
Ricky enters, holding a RING OF KEYS, followed by Jane.

                    RICKY
          This is where my dad hides out.

GLASS CASES filled with GUNS line the walls.

                    JANE
          I take it he's got a thing for guns.

Ricky crosses to a built-in CABINET behind the desk.

                    RICKY
          You got to see this one thing...

He unlocks the cabinet and opens it, revealing shelves
stacked with WAR MEMORABILIA.

          My dad would kill me if he knew I was in
          here.

                    JANE
          Did you steal his keys?

                    RICKY
          No. One of my clients is a locksmith. He
          was short on cash one night, so I let him
          pay me in trade.

He reaches into the cabinet and carefully removes an oval
CHINA PLATTER, which he hands to Jane. She examines it.

                    RICKY (CONT'D)
          Turn it over.

CLOSE on the bottom of the plate: A small SWASTIKA is
imprinted in the center.

                       JANE
          Oh my God.

                    RICKY
          It's like official state china of the
          Third Reich. There's a whole subculture
          of people who collect this Nazi shit. But
          my dad just has this one thing.

He puts the platter back into the cabinet and shuts the door,
then notices Jane looking at him oddly.

                    RICKY (CONT'D)
          What's wrong?

          No, you're scared of me.

          No I'm not.

But she is. Ricky studies her.

                    RICKY
          You want to see the most beautiful thing
          I've ever filmed?

                                                           60.



INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

On VIDEO: We're in an empty parking lot on a cold, gray day.
Something is floating across from us... it's an empty,
wrinkled, white PLASTIC BAG. We follow it as the wind carries
it in a circle around us, sometimes whipping it about
violently, or, without warning, sending it soaring skyward,
then letting it float gracefully down to the ground...

Jane and Ricky sit on the bed, watching his WIDE-SCREEN TV.

                    RICKY
          It was one of those days when it's a
          minute away from snowing. And there's
          this electricity in the air, you can
          almost hear it, right? And this bag was
          just... dancing with me. Like a little
          kid begging me to play with it. For
          fifteen minutes. That's the day I
          realized that there was this entire life
          behind things, and this incredibly
          benevolent force that wanted me to know
          there was no reason to be afraid. Ever.

A beat.

                    RICKY (CONT'D)
          Video's a poor excuse, I know. But it
          helps me remember... I need to
          remember...

Now Jane is watching him.

                    RICKY (CONT'D)
              (distant)
          Sometimes there's so much beauty in the
          world I feel like I can't take it... and
          my heart is going to cave in.

After a moment, Jane takes his hand. Then she leans in and
kisses him softly on the lips. His eyes scan hers, curious to
see how she reacts to this...

                    JANE
              (suddenly)
          Oh my God. What time is it?

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Lester sits at the table in sloppy clothes, eating his dinner
voraciously and drinking beer from a bottle. Across from him,
Carolyn picks at her food, watching him with contempt. EASY-
LISTENING MUSIC plays on the STEREO.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


We HEAR the back door SLAM, then Jane enters and quickly
takes her seat at the table.

                    JANE
          Sorry I'm late.

                    CAROLYN
              (overly cheerful)
          No, no, that's quite all right, dear.
          Your father and I were just discussing
          his day at work.
              (to Lester)
          Why don't you tell our daughter about it,
          honey?

Jane stares at both her parents, apprehensive. Lester looks
at Carolyn darkly, then flashes a "you-asked-for-it" grin.

                    LESTER
          Janie, today I quit my job. And then I
          told my boss to fuck himself, and then I
          blackmailed him for almost sixty thousand
          dollars. Pass the asparagus.

                    CAROLYN
          Your father seems to think this kind of
          behavior is something to be proud of.

                    LESTER
          And your mother seems to prefer I go
          through life like a fucking prisoner
          while she keeps my dick in a mason jar
          under the sink.

                    CAROLYN
              (ashen)
          How dare you speak to me that way in
          front of her? And I marvel that you can
          be so contemptuous of me, on the same day
          that you lose your job!

                    LESTER
          Lose it? I didn't lose it. It's not like,
          "Oops, where'd my job go?" I quit.
          Someone pass me the asparagus.

                    CAROLYN
          Oh! Oh! And I want to thank you for
          putting me under the added pressure of
          being the sole breadwinner now--

                    LESTER
          I already have a job.

                    CAROLYN
              (not stopping)
          No, no, don't give a second thought as to
          who's going to pay the mortgage. We'll
          just leave it all up to Carolyn. You
          mean, you're going to take care of
          everything now, Carolyn? Yes. I don't
          mind. I really don't. You mean,
          everything? You don't mind having the
          sole responsibility, your husband feels
          he can just quit his job--

                     LESTER
              (overlapping)
          Will someone pass me the fucking
          asparagus?

                    JANE
              (rises)
          Okay, I'm not going to be a part of this--

                    LESTER
              (means it)
          Sit down.

Jane does so, surprised and intimidated by the power in his
voice. Lester gets up, crosses to the other side of the table
to get a PLATE OF ASPARAGUS, then sits again as he serves
himself.

                     LESTER (CONT'D)
          I'm sick and tired of being treated    like
          I don't exist. You two do whatever    you
          want to do whenever you want to do    it and
          I don't complain. All I want is the    same
          courtesy--

                    CAROLYN
              (overlapping)
          Oh, you don't complain? Oh, excuse me.
          Excuse me. I must be psychotic then, if
          you don't complain. What is this?! Am I
          locked away in a padded cell somewhere,
          hallucinating? That's the only
          explanation I can think of--

Lester hurls the plate of asparagus against the wall with
such force it SHATTERS, frightening Carolyn and Jane.

                    LESTER
              (casual)
          Don't interrupt me, honey.


                                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (3)


He goes back to eating his meal, as if nothing unusual has
happened. Carolyn sits in her chair, shivering with rage.
Jane just stares at the plate in front of her.

                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          Oh, and another thing. From now on, we're
          going to alternate our dinner music.
          Because frankly, and I don't think I'm
          alone here, I'm really tired of this
          Lawrence Welk shit.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

Jane is sitting on her bed. There is a KNOCK at the door.

                      JANE
          Go. Away.

                    CAROLYN (O.C.)
          Honey, please let me in.

Jane rolls her eyes, crosses to the door and lets Carolyn in.

                    CAROLYN (CONT'D)
          I wish that you hadn't witnessed that
          awful scene tonight. But in a way, I'm
          glad.

                    JANE
          Why, so I could see what freaks you and
          Dad really are?

                      CAROLYN
          Me?

She stares at Jane, then starts to cry.

                    JANE
          Aw, Christ, Mom.

                    CAROLYN
              (tearful)
          No, I'm glad because you're old enough
          now to learn the most important lesson in
          life: you cannot count on anyone except
          yourself.
              (sighs)
          You cannot count on anyone except
          yourself. It's sad, but true, and the
          sooner you learn it, the better.




                                                    (CONTINUED)

                    JANE
          Look, Mom, I really don't feel like
          having a Kodak moment here, okay?

Carolyn suddenly SLAPS Jane, hard.

                    CAROLYN
          You ungrateful little brat. Just look at
          everything you have. When I was your age,
          I lived in a duplex. We didn't even have
          our own house.

Embarrassed, she quickly leaves. Jane looks in a mirror and
rubs her cheek, then crosses to the window and looks out.

EXT. FITTS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Jane's POV: We're across from Ricky's room, looking in. He
stands at the window with his DIGICAM, videotaping us. On the
WIDE-SCREEN TV behind him, we see Jane standing in her window
as she looks across at him. She waves. Ricky just keeps
videotaping. A beat, then she starts to take off her shirt.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

We're behind Ricky as he videotapes Jane in her window. She
has now removed her shirt. She stands there in her bra, then
reaches behind her back to unhook the bra.

On VIDEO: We ZOOM toward her as she takes off her bra
clumsily. She's obviously embarrassed, but she's gone this
far and there's no turning back. She stands there with her
breasts exposed, trying to look defiant, but she's achingly
vulnerable...

Suddenly, the door is thrown open and the Colonel enters,
incensed. Startled, Ricky turns around. As soon as his eyes
meet his father's, he knows what's up.

                    COLONEL
          You little bastard--

Ricky scrambles to dodge his father, but the Colonel is too
fast; he punches Ricky in the face, knocking him to the
floor.

                    COLONEL (CONT'D)
          How did you get in there?

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

From her window, Jane watches, pulling the drapes in front of
her.

                                                             65.



EXT. FITTS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Jane's POV: In the WINDOW across from us, the Colonel
proceeds to give Ricky a serious beating, punching his face.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ricky's lip is bleeding, but he maintains a steady gaze at
his father during this violence.

                    COLONEL
              (unnerved)
          How!? How?! C'mon, get up! Fight back,
          you little pussy!

                    RICKY
          No, sir. I won't fight you.

The Colonel grabs him by the collar.

                    COLONEL
          How did you get in there?

                    RICKY
          I picked the lock, sir.

                    COLONEL
          What were you looking for? Money? Are you
          on dope again?

                    RICKY
          No, sir. I wanted to show my girlfriend
          your Nazi plate.

A beat.

                    COLONEL
          Girlfriend?

                    RICKY
          Yes, sir. She lives next door.

The Colonel glances toward the window.

His POV: In the WINDOW across from us, Jane peeks out from
behind the drape. She quickly pulls it shut.

                    RICKY (CONT'D)
          Her name's Jane.

A beat. The Colonel is suddenly, deeply shamed.

CONTINUED:


                    COLONEL
          This is for your own good, boy. You have
          no respect for other people's things, for
          authority, for...

                    RICKY
          Sir, I'm sorry.

                    COLONEL
          You can't just go around doing whatever
          you feel like, you can't--there are rules
          in life--

                      RICKY
          Yes, sir.

                    COLONEL
          You need structure, you need discipline--

                     RICKY
               (simultaneous)
          Discipline. Yes, sir, thank you for
          trying to teach me. Don't give up on me,
          Dad.

The Colonel stands, still breathing heavily. Tenderness fills
his face, and he reaches out to touch Ricky's cheek.

                    COLONEL
          Oh, Ricky...

But something keeps him from doing it.

                    COLONEL (CONT'D)
          You stay out of there.

He leaves. Ricky gets up and goes to his bureau. He looks at
his reflection in the mirror, calmly takes a cloth and starts
to wipe the blood from his face.

                                               FADE TO BLACK.

In darkness, we HEAR repetitive GUNSHOTS.

                                                        FADE IN:

INT. INDOOR FIRING RANGE - ONE MONTH LATER

Carolyn, wearing PROTECTIVE HEADGEAR, is holding a GLOCK 19
AUTOMATIC REVOLVER with both hands, FIRING it directly at us.

She empties a round and stands there, exhilarated. An
ATTENDANT approaches with a new round of ammunition.

          I gotta say, Mrs. Burnham, when you first
          came here I thought you would be
          hopeless. But you're a natural.

                    CAROLYN
          Well, all I know is... I love shooting
          this gun!

And she starts FIRING again.

INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - LATER

Bobby Darin sings "DON'T RAIN ON MY    PARADE" on the RADIO.
Carolyn SINGS along as she drives.    Her face has lost its
usual resolute determination; she's    actually enjoying herself
spontaneously, and the lack of her    usual self-consciousness
allows us to see just how beautiful    she is.

ANGLE ON the GLOCK 19 sitting on the passenger seat amidst
some CDs.

Carolyn takes the gun and holds it at arm's length, admiring
it as she continues to SING.

EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - CONTINUOUS

The Mercedes turns onto Robin Hood Trail.

INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - CONTINUOUS

Carolyn's POV: We turn into the Burnham driveway. A 1970
PONTIAC FIREBIRD with racing stripes blocks our access to the
garage.

CLOSE on Carolyn: She doesn't like having things in her way.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Lester's REMOTE-CONTROLLED MODEL JEEP is zooming across the
floor of the family room, expertly maneuvering corners and
narrowly avoiding crashing.

Lester is sprawled on the couch in his underwear, drinking a
BEER and controlling the car. His working out is beginning to
produce results. The room, too, seems changed: sloppier, more
lived in.

Carolyn enters through the kitchen, flushed and angry. She
just stands there, staring at Lester. After a moment, he
looks up at her.

          What?

          Ah, whose car is that out front?

                    LESTER
          Mine. 1970 Pontiac Firebird. The car I
          always wanted and now I have it. I rule!

                    CAROLYN
          Where's the Camry?

                    LESTER
          I traded it in.

                    CAROLYN
          Shouldn't you have consulted me first?

                     LESTER
          Hmm, let me think... No. You never drove
          it.
              (then)
          Have you done something different? You
          look great.

                    CAROLYN
              (brusque)
          Where's Jane?

                     LESTER
          Jane not home. We have the whole house to
          ourselves.

He smiles at her playfully. She stares back, annoyed. It's
the same look she had at the beginning, when he dropped his
briefcase, but whatever power that look had is gone. Lester
just LAUGHS.

                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          Christ, Carolyn. When did you become
          so... joyless?

                    CAROLYN
              (taken aback)
          Joyless?! I am not joyless! There happens
          to be a lot about me that you don't know,
          mister smarty man. There is plenty of joy
          in my life.

              (leaning toward her)
          Whatever happened to that girl who used
          to fake seizures at frat parties when she
          got bored? And who used to run up to the
          roof of our first apartment building to
          flash the traffic helicopters? Have you
          totally forgotten about her? Because I
          haven't.

His face is close to hers, and suddenly the atmosphere is
charged. She pulls back automatically, but it's clear she's
drawn to him. He smiles, and moves even closer, holding his
beer loosely balanced. Then, just before their lips meet...

                    CAROLYN
              (barely audible)
          Lester. You're going to spill beer on the
          couch.

She's immediately sorry she said it, but it's too late. His
smile fades, and the moment is gone.

                    LESTER
          So what? It's just a couch.

                    CAROLYN
          This is a four thousand dollar sofa
          upholstered in Italian silk. This is not
          "just a couch."

                    LESTER
          It's just a couch!

He stands and gestures toward all the things in the room.

                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          This isn't life. This is just stuff. And
          it's become more important to you than
          living. Well, honey, that's just nuts.

Carolyn stares at him, on the verge of tears, then turns and
walks out of the room before he can see her cry.

                    LESTER (CONT'D)
              (calls after her)
          I'm only trying to help you.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

On VIDEO: Jane lays in Ricky's bed, wearing a tank top. She
glances at us.

                      JANE
              (shy)
          Don't.

We're watching the WIDE-SCREEN TV in Ricky's room.

A CORD leads from the TV to Ricky's DIGICAM. Ricky holds the
camera, sitting naked in a chair. It's been almost a month
since his father beat him up, and there are still slight
SCARS on his face. He's aiming his camera at Jane.

                      RICKY
          Why?

                    JANE
              (re: image on TV)
          It's weird, watching myself. I don't like
          how I look.

                    RICKY
          I can't believe you don't know how
          beautiful you are.

                    JANE
          I'm not going to sit here for that shit.

She gets out of bed, takes his Digicam and focuses it on him.
We see his image on the TV as she videotapes.

                    JANE (CONT'D)
          Ha. How does it feel now?

                      RICKY
          Fine.

                    JANE
          You don't feel naked?

                    RICKY
          I am naked.

                    JANE
          You know what I mean.

Jane ZOOMS in on his face, which remains placid.

                    JANE (CONT'D)
          Tell me about being in the hospital.

Ricky smiles.

                     RICKY
          When I was fifteen, my dad caught me
          smoking dope. He totally freaked and
          decided to send me to military school. I
          told you his whole thing about structure
          and discipline, right?
              (laughs)
          Well, of course, I got kicked out. Dad
          and I had this huge fight, and he hit
          me... and then the next day at school,
          some kid made a crack about my haircut,
          and... I just snapped. I wanted to kill
          him. And I would have. Killed him. If
          they hadn't pulled me off.
              (then)
          That's when my dad put me in the
          hospital. Then they drugged me up and
          left me in there for two years.

                    JANE
          Wow. You must really hate him.

                    RICKY
          He's not a bad man.

He grabs a half-smoked JOINT from an ashtray and lights it.

                    JANE
          Well... you better believe I'd hate my
          father if he did something like that to
          me.
              (laughs)
          Wait. I do hate my father.

                    RICKY
          Why?

He passes her the joint, then takes the Digicam and focuses
it on her. We see her image on the TV as he videotapes.

                    JANE
          He's a total asshole and he's got this
          crush on my friend Angela and it's
          disgusting.

                    RICKY
          You'd rather he had the crush on you?

                     JANE
          Gross, no! But it'd be nice if I was
          anywhere near as important to him as she
          is.

                    JANE (CONT'D)
          I know you think my dad's harmless, but
          you're wrong. He's doing massive
          psychological damage to me.

                    RICKY
          How?

Jane looks into the camera, a loopy, stoned grin on her face.

                    JANE
          Well, now, I too need structure. A little
          fucking discipline.

They LAUGH. She lays back on the bed.

                    JANE (CONT'D)
          I'm serious, though. How could he not be
          damaging me? I need a father who's a role
          model, not some horny geek-boy who's
          gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a
          girlfriend home from school.
              (snorts)
          What a lame-o. Somebody really should put
          him out of his misery.

Her mind wanders for a beat.

                    RICKY
          Want me to kill him for you?

Jane looks at him and sits up.

                    JANE
          Yeah, would you?

                    RICKY
              (smiles)
          It'll cost you.

                    JANE
          Well, I've been baby-sitting since I was
          about ten. I've got almost three thousand
          dollars. 'Course, I was saving it up for
          a boob job.

She stands and sticks out her breasts, then falls back on the
bed, LAUGHING.

                    JANE (CONT'D)
          But my tits can wait, huh?

                    RICKY
          You know, that's not a very nice thing to
          do, hiring somebody to kill your dad.

                    JANE
          Well, I guess I'm just not a very nice
          girl, then, am I?

She smiles dreamily at him. He turns the Digicam off and the
TV screen goes BLUE. He lowers the camera and looks at her
intently.

                    JANE (CONT'D)
              (suddenly nervous)
          You know I'm not serious, right?

                       RICKY
          Of course.

He puts the Digicam down and joins Jane on the bed. A long
moment where neither of them speaks. He caresses her hair,
gazing into her eyes.

                    RICKY (CONT'D)
          Do you know how lucky we are to have
          found each other?

EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - EARLY MORNING

We're FLYING above Robin Hood Trail. We see the BURNHAM'S
HOUSE below us as we APPROACH it steadily.

                    LESTER
          Remember those posters that said, "Today
          is the first day of the rest of your
          life?" Well, that's true of every day
          except one.
              (a beat)
          The day you die.

We're almost on top of the Burnham house now, as Lester,
wearing sweatpants and running shoes, bursts out of the front
door and dashes up the driveway.

EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - A SHORT TIME LATER

We're now at street level, as Lester runs toward us. He
carries a WALKMAN and wears EARPHONES, and we HEAR ROCK MUSIC
as he runs. The endorphins have kicked in, and Lester grins,
reveling in the sheer physical pleasure of his body.

                                                            74.



INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - A SHORT TIME LATER

The blender GRINDS as Lester, still in his sweatpants, makes
himself a high-protein shake. He's in excellent shape; even
his posture has changed, and he moves with the confident,
easy swagger of an athlete. Jane watches him blankly from the
kitchen table.

Carolyn enters. Lester leans against the counter, drinking
his shake directly from the blender pitcher, eyeing her. He's
got a newfound sexual energy that makes her uncomfortable,
and he knows it. Carolyn quickly rinses off her coffee cup,
avoiding his eyes, and starts out.

                    CAROLYN
          Jane, hurry up. I've got a very important
          appointment--

                    JANE
          Mom, is it okay if Angela sleeps over
          tonight?

Jane looks at Lester to see how he reacts. He doesn't.

                    CAROLYN
          Well, of course, she's always welcome.
              (on her way out)
          You know, I thought maybe you two had a
          fight. I haven't seen her around here in
          a while.

And she's gone. Jane continues staring at her father.
Finally, he glances over at her.

                    LESTER
          What?

                    JANE
              (nervous)
          I've been too embarrassed to bring her
          over. Because of you, and the way that
          you behave.

                    LESTER
          What are you talking about? I've barely
          even spoken to her.

                    JANE
              (angry)
          Dad! You stare at her all the time, like
          you're drunk! It's disgusting!



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             75.
CONTINUED:


                    LESTER
              (angry himself)
          You better watch yourself, Janie, or
          you're going to turn into a real bitch,
          just like your mother.

Jane is stunned. She quickly rises, trying to get out of the
kitchen before she starts crying.

ANGLE on Lester, and the immediate regret in his eyes.

                    LESTER (CONT'D)
              (under his breath)
          Fuck.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

We're outside Ricky's room, MOVING slowly toward the open
door, through which we can see Ricky, standing at his bureau
mirror, combing his hair. The scars on his face are almost
gone now.

A REVERSE ANGLE reveals the Colonel standing outside the door
looking in, watching Ricky with great tenderness. Then Ricky
looks up at him, and the Colonel is suddenly self-conscious.

                    COLONEL
              (brusque)
          You ready to go?

                    RICKY
          Oh, I don't need a ride. I'm going to go
          in with Jane and her mom.

EXT. FITTS HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

Ricky emerges from the house, followed by the Colonel, who
watches his son as he heads toward the Burnham house.

His POV: Carolyn waves from the Mercedes, flashing an
insincere smile. Jane leans forward from the passenger seat
and glares at us. As Ricky starts to get in the car, Lester
emerges from the house in his sweatpants.

                    LESTER
          Yo, Ricky. How's it going?

                    RICKY
          Pretty decent, Mr. Burnham.

Ricky pulls his door shut, but not before Lester mouths "call
me" and Ricky gives a slight nod in acknowledgment.


                                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


CLOSE on the Colonel's face: he looks confused.

As the Mercedes backs out of the driveway, Lester glances
over at him.

Lester's POV: The Colonel watches the car driving off, then
looks at us. His face tightens.

LESTER studies him for a moment, then grins and salutes
before going inside the house.

CLOSE on the Colonel, deeply troubled.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The door swings open silently and the Colonel enters. He
starts going through Ricky's bureau. He opens the DRAWER in
which we know Ricky keeps his marijuana, but he doesn't
discover its false bottom. He stands and looks around, his
eyes finally landing on:

The DIGICAM and a stack of CASSETTES on a shelf. The camera
is still connected to the TV.

The Colonel turns on the TV, examines the Digicam and presses
"play." The TV's blank screen suddenly gives way to...

On VIDEO: Barbara Fitts sits at the kitchen table, staring
off into space.

The Colonel watches, at first baffled, then impatient. He
takes the cassette out of the Digicam and inserts another. On
the TV screen we see...

On VIDEO: Through the Burnham's GARAGE WINDOW, we see Lester
step out of his pants and briefs. Then, naked except for his
black socks, he grabs the dumbbells and starts lifting them,
watching his reflection in the window as he does...

The Colonel sinks slowly onto Ricky's bed, mesmerized.

INT. MR. SMILEY'S - LATER

Lester, wearing a Mr. Smiley's uniform, is happily flipping
burgers on a grill.

                    CO-WORKER
          Hey Lester, I need that Super Smiley with
          cheese, A.S.A.P.

          hombre.

Lester looks up suddenly when he HEARS:

                    CAROLYN (O.S.)
              (over speakers)
          What's good here?

              (over speakers)
          Then I guess we'll just have to be bad,
          won't we?
              (then)
          I think I'll have a double Smiley
          Sandwich and curly fries, and a vanilla
          shake.

                    BUDDY (O.C.)
              (over speakers)
          Make that two.

                    COUNTER GIRL (O.C.)
              (over speakers)
          Please drive around thank you.

Lester's face darkens, then... he smiles. He puts his spatula
down.

EXT. MR. SMILEY'S - CONTINUOUS

The Mercedes pulls around to the DRIVE-THRU WINDOW. Carolyn
drives; Buddy sits beside her.

                    CAROLYN
          I think we deserve a little junk food,
          after the workout we had this morning.

                    BUDDY
              (nuzzles her neck)
          I'm flattered.

They are too involved with each other to notice Lester
watching them from the drive-thru window.

                    LESTER
              (overly cheerful)
          Smile! You're at Mr. Smiley's!

Carolyn almost jumps out of her skin.

Lester leans out of the drive-thru window, grinning at her,
holding bags filled with fast food. The Counter Girl stands
next to him, staring blankly.

          Would you like to    try our new beef and
          cheese pot pie on    a stick, just a dollar
          ninety-nine for a    limited time only?

Carolyn struggles to appear nonchalant.

              (re: Buddy)
          We were just at a seminar.
              (then, all business)
          Buddy, this is my--

                    LESTER
          Her husband. We've met before, but
          something tells me you're going to
          remember me this time.

                    COUNTER GIRL
              (to Carolyn)
          Whoa. You are so busted.

                     CAROLYN
               (flustered)
          You know, this really doesn't concern
          you.

                    LESTER
          Actually, Janeane is senior drive-thru
          manager, so you kind of are on her turf.
              (to Carolyn, quietly)
          So. This makes sense.

                    CAROLYN
              (miserable)
          Oh, Lester--

                     LESTER
          Honey, it's okay. I want you to be happy.
              (then)
          Would you like Smiley Sauce with that?

                    CAROLYN
          Lester, just stop it!

                    LESTER
          Uh-uh. You don't get to tell me what to
          do. Ever again.


                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                            79.

Carolyn closes her eyes, defeated, then grabs the wheel,
shifts gears and drives off.

EXT. TOP HAT MOTEL - A SHORT TIME LATER

The sky is filled with ominous gray clouds. Wind whips
garbage across the parking lot as Carolyn's Mercedes pulls in
next to Buddy's Jaguar.

INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - CONTINUOUS

Carolyn grips the wheel tightly, staring straight ahead.
Buddy looks at her unhappily.

                    BUDDY
          I'm sorry. I guess we should cool it for
          a while. I'm facing a potentially very
          expensive divorce.

                    CAROLYN
          Oh, no. I understand completely.
              (sarcastic)
          In order to be successful, one must
          project an image of success. At all
          times.

She regrets it the second it's out of her mouth, and turns to
him. He just looks at her sadly, then gets out of the car and
shuts the door. She starts to CRY. As before, she SLAPS
herself, hard.

                    CAROLYN (CONT'D)
          Stop it. Stop it!

She closes her eyes tight, trying to stop the tears, then
suddenly SCREAMS as loud as she can.

EXT. TOP HAT MOTEL - CONTINUOUS

Buddy's Jaguar speeds off, leaving the Mercedes alone in the
parking lot. We can still HEAR Carolyn's muffled SCREAMING.
There is a sound of distant THUNDER.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - THAT NIGHT

It's RAINING outside. We HEAR ROCK MUSIC as Lester pumps
iron. He puts the weights down and looks at his REFLECTION in
the window:

His POV: His arms are pumped. He smiles.




                                                 (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


He reaches under the bench and grabs a CIGAR BOX. Opening it,
he digs through MARIJUANA PARAPHERNALIA, only to pull out an
empty ZIP-LOC BAG.

                      LESTER
          Shit.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Ricky and the Colonel sit at the table, eating in silence.
Barbara rinses off a pan at the sink, then stares at it as if
she can't quite remember what she meant to do with it. We
suddenly HEAR a BEEPING noise. Ricky pulls his BEEPER off his
belt and checks it.

                    RICKY
              (getting up)
          I have to run next door. Jane left her
          geometry book in my bag and she needs it
          to do her homework.

He heads into the hall. The Colonel watches him go, uneasy.

INT. ANGELA'S BMW - CONTINUOUS

Angela drives, squinting through the windshield as the wipers
move back and forth.

                    ANGELA
          So you and psycho boy are fucking on
          like, a regular basis now, right?

                      JANE
                (irritable)
          No.

                    ANGELA
          Oh, come on. You can tell me. Does he
          have a big dick?

                    JANE
          Look, I'm not gonna talk about his dick
          with you, okay? It's not like that.

                     ANGELA
          Not like what? Doesn't he have one?
              (then)
          Why don't you want to talk about it? I
          mean, I tell you every single detail
          about every guy that I fuck.




                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           81.
CONTINUED:


                    JANE
          Yeah, and maybe you shouldn't, all right?
          Maybe I don't really want to hear all
          that.

                    ANGELA
          Oh, so now that you have a boyfriend,
          you're like, above it?
              (rolls her eyes)
          We gotta get you a real man.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

The Colonel rinses off his plate at the sink. Something
outside catches his eye, and he cranes his neck to get a
better look at...

His POV: Through the window over the sink, we can see into
the Burnham's GARAGE WINDOW. Our view is blurred by the RAIN,
but we see Lester, his upper body pumped and glistening in
sweat as he counts out a wad of BILLS... and then Ricky walks
into view.

The Colonel's face tightens.

His POV: Lester drapes his arm around Ricky as he gives him
the money. We can only see Lester from the waist up, so he
looks naked.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

Ricky, his hair wet from the rain, puts the cash in his
pocket. Lester's arm remains draped around his shoulder.

                    RICKY
              (grins)
          You got any papers?

                    LESTER
          Yeah, in the cigar box, right over there.
              (laughs)
          You know, put up a fight, dude! You are
          such a pushover. "No I can't. Really.
          Okay."

And he slaps Ricky playfully on the chest. Ricky grins, then
squats down and reaches under the weight bench.

                    RICKY
          You should learn to roll a joint.

Lester sits in the bowl chair and leans back, his hands
behind his head, watching Ricky roll the joint.

                                                            82.



INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

The Colonel's POV: Lester leans back in his chair. We see
only Ricky's back and shoulders as he rolls the joint. After
a beat, Lester's jaw drops, then he throws his head back.
From our perspective, it looks very much like Ricky is giving
Lester a blow job.

The Colonel watches, incredulous. Then we HEAR a CAR
APPROACHING, and the Colonel glances over at:

His POV: Angela's BMW pulls into the driveway, stopping
behind Lester's Firebird. As Angela and Jane get out and run
toward the house, our focus MOVES back to the GARAGE WINDOW.
Ricky stands, looking a little panicked. Lester pulls on his
T-shirt, and both he and Ricky cross out of view.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Lester leans nonchalantly against the counter. Jane and
Angela enter. Jane frowns when she sees him.

                    LESTER
          Oh. Hi.

                    JANE
          Where's Mom?

                    LESTER
          Don't know.

                    ANGELA
          Hi, Mr. Burnham.

                    LESTER
          Hi.

He's trying to remain cool, and doing a pretty good job.

                    ANGELA
          Wow. Look at you. Have you been working
          out?

                    LESTER
          Some.

Jane rolls her eyes and exits. Angela walks over to Lester.

                    ANGELA
          You can really tell. Look at those arms.

She places her hand on his arm flirtatiously, looks up at him
and smiles, fully expecting to intimidate him by doing so.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             83.
CONTINUED:


But something has changed, and he isn't intimidated at all.
He looks directly back at her, leans in and smiles slowly.

                    LESTER
          You like muscles?

His voice is low and intense. She moves away, suddenly
insecure.

                    ANGELA
          I--I should probably go see what Jane's
          up to.

And she heads out quickly. Lester watches her go, baffled.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ricky enters, wet from the pouring rain, and crosses to his
bureau, pulling the wad of CASH out of his pocket as he goes.

                    COLONEL (O.C.)
          Where'd you get that?

Ricky turns, startled.

His POV: The Colonel steps out of the shadows.

Ricky takes a step back.

                    RICKY
          From my job.

                     COLONEL
          Don't lie to me.
              (beat)
          I saw you with him.

                    RICKY
              (incredulous)
          You were watching me?

                    COLONEL
          What did he make you do?

                    RICKY
              (laughs)
          Dad, you don't really think... me and Mr.
          Burnham?

          I will not sit back and watch my only son
          become a cocksucker!

                    RICKY
          Jesus, what is with you--

The Colonel BACKHANDS Ricky so hard it sends the boy
sprawling.

                    COLONEL
          I swear to God, I will throw you out of
          this house and never look at you again.

                    RICKY
              (taken aback)
          You mean that?

                    COLONEL
          Damn straight I do. I'd rather you were
          dead than be a fucking faggot.

A beat. Ricky suddenly smiles. He gets up.

                    RICKY
          You're right. I suck dick for money.

                     COLONEL
          Boy--

                    RICKY
          Two thousand dollars. I'm that good.

                     COLONEL
          Get out.

                    RICKY
          And you should see me fuck. I'm the best
          piece of ass in three states.

                    COLONEL
              (explodes)
          Get out!! I don't ever want to see you
          again!!

Ricky eyes the Colonel. He's finally discovered a way to
break free from his father, and he can't believe it was this
simple.

                    RICKY
          What a sad old man you are.

                    COLONEL
              (a whisper)
          Get out.

Ricky grabs his backpack, turns and walks out the door,
leaving the Colonel standing there, glassy-eyed and breathing
heavily.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Ricky enters to discover Barbara standing in the middle of
the room, clutching a dish, frightened. She's obviously heard
his argument with his father, and she looks into his eyes,
searching, aware that something eventful is taking place.

                    RICKY
          Mom, I'm leaving.

A beat.

                    BARBARA
          Okay, wear a raincoat.

                    RICKY
              (hugs her)
          I wish things would have been better for
          you. Take care of Dad.

He kisses her cheek softly, then exits out the back door,
leaving her standing alone, still clutching her dish.

The Colonel's POV: Below us, Ricky dashes through the rain to
the Burnham's front door and knocks. Lester opens it and lets
him in.

The Colonel looks coldly down at us from Ricky's bedroom
window, and then he pulls the drapes shut.

TAPE on the STEREO.

          and removing their ability to make us

         You shut up, bitch!

                   ANGELA
         Jane! He is a freak!

                    JANE
          Well, then so am I! And we'll always be
          freaks and we'll never be like other
          people. And you'll never be a freak
          because you're just too perfect.

                    ANGELA
          Oh, yeah? Well, at least I'm not ugly.

                    RICKY
          Yes, you are. And you're boring. And
          you're totally ordinary. And you know it.

Angela stares at him, stunned, then starts toward the door.

                    ANGELA
          You two deserve each other.

And she exits, SLAMMING the door behind her. Jane turns to
Ricky and he takes her in his arms.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Angela sits on the stairs, shaken, crying.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

We're MOVING SLOWLY toward the Burnham's GARAGE WINDOW
through the RAIN. Through the window, we see Lester, wearing
only his sweatpants, performing bench presses.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

Through the window, we see the Colonel standing outside,
watching. We ZOOM slowly in on him as he watches, transfixed.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

His POV: Lester finishes his last rep, then racks the weights
and sits up, sweaty and out of breath. He runs his free hand
over his chest... and then he glances at us, suddenly aware
he's being watched.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

Lester and the Colonel stare at each other through the
window.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

The RAIN is coming down in sheets now, and there is a sharp
CLAP of THUNDER. We're directly outside the GARAGE DOOR as it
slowly lifts to reveal Lester smiling at us.

                    LESTER
          Jesus, man. You're soaked.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

Lester pulls the Colonel inside. The Colonel moves stiffly
and seems preoccupied, slightly disoriented.

                    LESTER
          You want me to get Ricky? He's in Jane's
          room.

The Colonel just stands there, looking at Lester.

                      LESTER (CONT'D)
          You okay?

                    COLONEL
              (his voice thick)
          Where's your wife?

                    LESTER
          Uh... I don't know. Probably out fucking
          that dorky prince of real estate asshole.
          And you know what? I don't care.

The Colonel moves closer towards him.

                    COLONEL
          Your wife is with another man and you
          don't care?

                    LESTER
          Nope, our marriage is just for show. A
          commercial, for how normal we are. When
          we are anything but.

He grins... and so does the Colonel.

                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          You're shaking.

He places his hand on the Colonel's shoulder. The Colonel
closes his eyes.

                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          We really should get you out of these
          clothes.

                    COLONEL
              (a whisper)
          Yes...

CONTINUED:


He opens his eyes and looks at Lester, his face filled with
an anguished vulnerability we wouldn't have thought possible
from him. His eyes are brimming with tears. Lester leans in,
concerned.

                       LESTER
          It's okay.

                    COLONEL
              (hoarse)

I...

                    LESTER
              (softly)
          Just tell me what you need.

The Colonel reaches up and places his hand on Lester's
cheek... and then kisses him. Lester is momentarily stunned,
and then he pushes the Colonel away. The Colonel's face
crumples in shame.

                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm sorry. You got the
          wrong idea.

The Colonel stares at the floor, blinking, and then he turns
and runs out the open garage door into the rainy night.

INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - CONTINUOUS

Carolyn is still listening to the same MOTIVATIONAL TAPE. She
holds the GLOCK in her hand.

                    TAPE VOICE
          "I refuse to be a victim." When this
          becomes your mantra, constantly running
          through your head--

Carolyn switches the TAPE OFF and puts the gun in her purse.

                    CAROLYN
          I refuse to be a victim.

The Mercedes pulls away from the shoulder.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Lester enters, opens the refrigerator and grabs a BEER.
Suddenly we HEAR MUSIC coming from the other room. Lester
opens his beer and starts toward the family room.

                                                             91.



INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

His POV: AS we MOVE SLOWLY around a corner, Angela comes into
view, standing at the STEREO, holding a CD case. She's been
crying; her face is puffy, and her hair mussed. She regards
us apprehensively... then puts on a slightly defiant smile.

                    ANGELA
          I hope you don't mind if I play the
          stereo.

Lester leans against the wall and takes a swig of his beer.

                     LESTER
          Not at all.
              (then)
          Bad night?

                    ANGELA
          Not really bad, just... strange.

                    LESTER
              (grins)
          Believe me. It couldn't possibly be any
          stranger than mine.

She smiles. They stand there in silence; the atmosphere is
charged.

                    ANGELA
          Jane and I had a fight.
              (after a beat)
          It was about you.

She's trying to be seductive as she says this, but she's
pretty bad at it. Lester raises his eyebrows.

                    ANGELA (CONT'D)
          She's mad at me because I said I think
          you're sexy.

Lester grins. He is sexy.

                    LESTER
              (offering beer)
          Do you want a sip?

She nods. Lester holds the bottle up to her mouth and she
drinks clumsily. He gently wipes her chin with the back of
his hand.

CONTINUED:


                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          So... are you going to tell me? What you
          want?

                    ANGELA
          I don't know.

                    LESTER
          You don't know?

His face is very close to hers. She's unnerved--this is
happening too fast...

                    ANGELA
          What do you want?

                    LESTER
          Are you kidding? I want you. I've wanted
          you since the first moment I saw you. You
          are the most beautiful thing I have ever
          seen.

Angela takes a deep breath just before Lester leans in to
kiss her cheek, her forehead, her eyelids, her neck...

                    ANGELA
          You don't think I'm ordinary?

                    LESTER
          You couldn't be ordinary if you tried.

                     ANGELA
          Thank you.
              (far away)
          I don't think there's anything worse than
          being ordinary...

And Lester kisses her on the lips.

legs, then moves up and caresses her face...

Ricky and Jane, fully clothed, lie curled up on Jane's bed.

          Are you scared?

                    RICKY
          I don't get scared.

                    JANE
          My parents will try to find me.

                    RICKY
          Mine won't.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Lester starts unbuttoning Angela's blouse. She seems
disconnected from what's happening. Lester pulls her blouse
open, exposing her breasts.

Lester looks down at her, grinning, unable to believe he's
actually about to do what he's dreamed of so many times, and
then...

                    ANGELA
          This is my first time.

Lester LAUGHS.

                    LESTER
          You're kidding.

                     ANGELA
              (a whisper)
          I'm sorry.

A beat. Lester looks down at her, his grin fading.

His POV: Angela lies beneath us, embarrassed and vulnerable.
This is not the mythically carnal creature of Lester's
fantasies; this is a nervous child.

                    ANGELA (CONT'D)
          I still want to do it... I just thought I
          should tell you... in case you wondered
          why I wasn't... better.

Lester's face falls. There's no way he's going to go through
with this now.

                     ANGELA (CONT'D)
              (confused)
          What's wrong? I thought you said I was
          beautiful.

                    LESTER
              (tenderly)
          You are beautiful.

He grabs a blanket from the back of the couch and drapes it
around her shoulders, covering her nakedness.

                    LESTER (CONT'D)
          You are so beautiful... and I would be a
          very lucky man...

He smiles and shakes his head. Humiliated, Angela starts to
cry.

                    ANGELA
          I feel so stupid.

                       LESTER
          Don't.

He hugs her, letting her put her head on his shoulder,
stroking her hair and rocking her gently.

                       ANGELA
          I'm sorry.

Lester takes her by the shoulders and looks at her, serious.

                    LESTER
          You have nothing to be sorry about.

But she keeps crying. Lester hugs her again. We HEAR a loud
CLAP of THUNDER outside.

                    LESTER (CONT'D)
              (smiles)
          It's okay. Everything's okay.

CLOSE on Carolyn's eyes, reflected in the REAR-VIEW MIRROR.
She turns her head to look out the window:

Her POV: The RED DOOR of the Burnham house stands out, even
in the pouring rain.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Angela, once again fully clothed, sits at the kitchen
counter. She's eating a turkey sandwich.

                    ANGELA
          Wow. I was starving.

Lester puts a jar of mayonnaise back in the refrigerator.

                    LESTER
          Do you want me to make you another one?

                    ANGELA
          No, no, no. I'm fine.

He turns to her and cocks an eyebrow.

                    LESTER
              (concerned)
          You sure?

                    ANGELA
          I mean, I'm still a little weirded out,
          but...
              (sincerely)
          ...I feel better. Thanks.

A long beat, as Lester studies her, then:

          How's Jane?

                    ANGELA
          What do you mean?

                    LESTER
          I mean, how's her life? Is she happy? Is
          she miserable? I'd really like to know,
          and she'd die before she'd ever tell me
          about it.

Angela shifts uncomfortably.

                    ANGELA
          She's... she's really happy. She thinks
          she's in love.

Angela rolls her eyes at how silly this notion is.

                    LESTER
              (quietly)
          Good for her.

An awkward beat.

                    ANGELA
          How are you?

                     LESTER
              (smiles, taken aback)
          God, it's been a long time since anybody
          asked me that.
              (thinks about it)
          I'm great.

They just sit there, smiling at each other, then:

                    ANGELA
              (suddenly)
          I've gotta go to the bathroom.

She crosses off. Lester watches her go, then stands there
wondering why he should suddenly feel so content.

                     LESTER
              (laughs)
          I'm great.

Something at the edge of the counter catches his eye, and he
reaches for...

CLOSE on a framed PHOTOGRAPH as he picks it up: It's the
photo we saw earlier of him, Carolyn and Jane, taken several
years ago at an amusement park. It's startling how happy they
look.

Lester crosses to the kitchen table, where he sits and
studies the photo. He suddenly seems older, more mature...
and then he smiles: the deep, satisfied smile of a man who
just now understands the punch line of a joke he heard long
ago...

After a beat, the barrel of a GUN rises up behind his head,
aimed at the base of his skull.

ANGLE ON an arrangement of fresh-cut ROSES   in a vase on the
opposite counter, deep crimson against the   WHITE TILE WALL.
Then a GUNSHOT suddenly rings out, ECHOING   unnaturally.
Instantly, the tile is sprayed with BLOOD,   the same deep
crimson as the roses.

          Oh God.

Their POV: A pool of blood is forming on the kitchen table.

Ricky comes into the kitchen and slowly approaches Lester's
lifeless body, wide-eyed but not afraid. Jane follows him, in
shock. Ricky kneels, gazing at Lester's unseen face... then
he smiles, ever so slightly.

His POV: Lester looks back at us; his eyes are lifeless, but
he's smiling the same slight smile.

                       RICKY

HEAR a GUNSHOT from downstairs. They look at each other,
alarmed.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DUSK

In BLACK & WHITE: Maple trees in autumn. Ghostly LEAVES
FLUTTER slowly toward pavement.

                    LESTER (V.O.)
          And yellow leaves, from the maple trees,
          that lined my street...

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - POWDER ROOM - NIGHT

Angela stands in front of the mirror, fixing her make-up. We
HEAR the GUNSHOT again. Angela turns, frightened.

INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

In BLACK & WHITE: CLOSE on an ancient woman's papery HANDS as
they button a cardigan sweater.

                    LESTER (V.O.)
          Or my grandmother's hands, and the way
          her skin seemed like paper...

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - NIGHT

Carolyn walks slowly toward the RED DOOR, drenched to the
bone, clutching her PURSE tightly. We HEAR the GUNSHOT again.

EXT. SUBURB - DAY

In BLACK & WHITE: A 1970 PONTIAC FIREBIRD in the driveway of
a suburban home. The SUN'S REFLECTION in the windshield
FLASHES BRILLIANTLY.



                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             99.
CONTINUED:


                    LESTER (V.O.)
          And the first time I saw my cousin Tony's
          brand new Firebird...

INT. FITTS HOUSE - THE COLONEL'S STUDY - NIGHT

The Colonel enters, wet. He's wearing LATEX GLOVES. BLOOD
covers the front of his T-shirt. He paces in front of one of
his GUN CASES; the GLASS DOOR is open, and a gun is
conspicuously missing from inside.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT

In BLACK & WHITE: Jane opens her bedroom door, staring at us.

                    LESTER (V.O.)
          And Janie...

EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DUSK

In BLACK & WHITE: A door opens to reveal 4-YEAR-OLD JANE,
dressed for Halloween in a Princess costume, holding a lit
SPARKLER aloft and smiling shyly at us.

                    LESTER (V.O.)
          And Janie...

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Carolyn enters, terrified, still clutching her PURSE. She
shuts the door and locks it, then takes the GLOCK 19 out of
her purse. She opens the closet door and shoves the gun into
a HAMPER. Then, suddenly aware of Lester's scent, she grabs
as many of his clothes as she can and pulls them to her,
burying her face in them. She sinks to her knees, pulling
several items of clothing down with her, and she begins to
cry.

EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT

                                              IN BLACK & WHITE:

A younger Carolyn sits across from us in one of those
SPINNING-TEACUP RIDES, LAUGHING uncontrollably as she twists
the wheel in front of her, making us SPIN even faster.

                    LESTER (V.O.)
              (with love)
          And... Carolyn.

                                                           100.



EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

On VIDEO: We're watching the video Ricky showed Jane earlier,
of the empty white PLASTIC BAG being blown about. The wind
carries it in a circle around us, sometimes whipping it about
violently, or, without warning, sending it soaring skyward,
then letting it float gracefully down to the ground...

                    LESTER (V.O.)
          I guess I could be pretty pissed off
          about what happened to me... but it's
          hard to stay mad, when there's so much
          beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel
          like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's
          too much, my heart fills up like a
          balloon that's about to burst...

EXT. - ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - DAY

We're FLYING once again over Robin Hood Trail, ASCENDING
SLOWLY.

                    LESTER (V.O.)
          ...and then I remember to relax, and stop
          trying to hold on to it, and then it
          flows through me like rain and I can't
          feel anything but gratitude for every
          single moment of my stupid little life...
              (amused)
          You have no idea what I'm talking about,
          I'm sure. But don't worry...

                                               FADE TO BLACK.

                    LESTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          You will someday.
